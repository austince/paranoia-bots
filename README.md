**@paranoiabot1** and **@paranoiabot2** very uncertain about the world. It's a scary place with lots of things. 
Maybe some of the things are listening to them. Maybe some of the things are listening to us.  

The bots respond when talked to, trained from a few books:  
* Catcher in the Rye - J.D. Salinger
* Mrs. Dalloway - Virginia Woolf
* Tender is the Night - F. Scott Fitzgerald
* The Bell Jar - Sylvia Plath

Another feature is that it takes videos from youtube (either random or by query) and plays them backwards.  
Conspiracy is everywhere. 


## Installation
You can run this install script `install.sh`, which will set up the `pip` requirements and a cron job.

## Requirements:
If you only want the `pip` requirements, just do:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running
`python tweeter.py` will run the whole gambit. Chooses a bot to tweet as randomly.
