If
you
really
want
to
hear
about
it
,
the
first
thing
you
'll
probably
want
to
know
is
where
I
was
born
,
an
what
my
lousy
childhood
was
like
,
and
how
my
parents
were
occupied
and
all
before
they
had
me
,
and
all
that
David
Copperfield
kind
of
crap
,
but
I
do
n't
feel
like
going
into
it
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
In
the
first
place
,
that
stuff
bores
me
,
and
in
the
second
place
,
my
parents
would
have
about
two
hemorrhages
apiece
if
I
told
anything
pretty
personal
about
them
.
They
're
quite
touchy
about
anything
like
that
,
especially
my
father
.
They
're
nice
and
all
--
I
'm
not
saying
that
--
but
they
're
also
touchy
as
hell
.
Besides
,
I
'm
not
going
to
tell
you
my
whole
goddam
autobiography
or
anything
.
I
'll
just
tell
you
about
this
madman
stuff
that
happened
to
me
around
last
Christmas
just
before
I
got
pretty
run-down
and
had
to
come
out
here
and
take
it
easy
.
I
mean
that
's
all
I
told
D.B
.
about
,
and
he
's
my
brother
and
all
.
He
's
in
Hollywood
.
That
is
n't
too
far
from
this
crumby
place
,
and
he
comes
over
and
visits
me
practically
every
week
end
.
He
's
going
to
drive
me
home
when
I
go
home
next
month
maybe
.
He
just
got
a
Jaguar
.
One
of
those
little
English
jobs
that
can
do
around
two
hundred
miles
an
hour
.
It
cost
him
damn
near
four
thousand
bucks
.
He
's
got
a
lot
of
dough
,
now
.
He
did
n't
use
to
.
He
used
to
be
just
a
regular
writer
,
when
he
was
home
.
He
wrote
this
terrific
book
of
short
stories
,
The
Secret
Goldfish
,
in
case
you
never
heard
of
him
.
The
best
one
in
it
was
``
The
Secret
Goldfish
.
''
It
was
about
this
little
kid
that
would
n't
let
anybody
look
at
his
goldfish
because
he
'd
bought
it
with
his
own
money
.
It
killed
me
.
Now
he
's
out
in
Hollywood
,
D.B.
,
being
a
prostitute
.
If
there
's
one
thing
I
hate
,
it
's
the
movies
.
Do
n't
even
mention
them
to
me
.
Where
I
want
to
start
telling
is
the
day
I
left
Pencey
Prep
.
Pencey
Prep
is
this
school
that
's
in
Agerstown
,
Pennsylvania
.
You
probably
heard
of
it
.
You
've
probably
seen
the
ads
,
anyway
.
They
advertise
in
about
a
thousand
magazines
,
always
showing
some
hotshot
guy
on
a
horse
jumping
over
a
fence
.
Like
as
if
all
you
ever
did
at
Pencey
was
play
polo
all
the
time
.
I
never
even
once
saw
a
horse
anywhere
near
the
place
.
And
underneath
the
guy
on
the
horse
's
picture
,
it
always
says
:
``
Since
1888
we
have
been
molding
boys
into
splendid
,
clear-thinking
young
men
.
''
Strictly
for
the
birds
.
They
do
n't
do
any
damn
more
molding
at
Pencey
than
they
do
at
any
other
school
.
And
I
did
n't
know
anybody
there
that
was
splendid
and
clear-thinking
and
all
.
Maybe
two
guys
.
If
that
many
.
And
they
probably
came
to
Pencey
that
way
.
Anyway
,
it
was
the
Saturday
of
the
football
game
with
Saxon
Hall
.
The
game
with
Saxon
Hall
was
supposed
to
be
a
very
big
deal
around
Pencey
.
It
was
the
last
game
of
the
year
,
and
you
were
supposed
to
commit
suicide
or
something
if
old
Pencey
did
n't
win
.
I
remember
around
three
o'clock
that
afternoon
I
was
standing
way
the
hell
up
on
top
of
Thomsen
Hill
,
right
next
to
this
crazy
cannon
that
was
in
the
Revolutionary
War
and
all
.
You
could
see
the
whole
field
from
there
,
and
you
could
see
the
two
teams
bashing
each
other
all
over
the
place
.
You
could
n't
see
the
grandstand
too
hot
,
but
you
could
hear
them
all
yelling
,
deep
and
terrific
on
the
Pencey
side
,
because
practically
the
whole
school
except
me
was
there
,
and
scrawny
and
faggy
on
the
Saxon
Hall
side
,
because
the
visiting
team
hardly
ever
brought
many
people
with
them
.
There
were
never
many
girls
at
all
at
the
football
games
.
Only
seniors
were
allowed
to
bring
girls
with
them
.
It
was
a
terrible
school
,
no
matter
how
you
looked
at
it
.
I
like
to
be
somewhere
at
least
where
you
can
see
a
few
girls
around
once
in
a
while
,
even
if
they
're
only
scratching
their
arms
or
blowing
their
noses
or
even
just
giggling
or
something
.
Old
Selma
Thurmer
--
she
was
the
headmaster
's
daughter
--
showed
up
at
the
games
quite
often
,
but
she
was
n't
exactly
the
type
that
drove
you
mad
with
desire
.
She
was
a
pretty
nice
girl
,
though
.
I
sat
next
to
her
once
in
the
bus
from
Agerstown
and
we
sort
of
struck
up
a
conversation
.
I
liked
her
.
She
had
a
big
nose
and
her
nails
were
all
bitten
down
and
bleedy-looking
and
she
had
on
those
damn
falsies
that
point
all
over
the
place
,
but
you
felt
sort
of
sorry
for
her
.
What
I
liked
about
her
,
she
did
n't
give
you
a
lot
of
horse
manure
about
what
a
great
guy
her
father
was
.
She
probably
knew
what
a
phony
slob
he
was
.
The
reason
I
was
standing
way
up
on
Thomsen
Hill
,
instead
of
down
at
the
game
,
was
because
I
'd
just
got
back
from
New
York
with
the
fencing
team
.
I
was
the
goddam
manager
of
the
fencing
team
.
Very
big
deal
.
We
'd
gone
in
to
New
York
that
morning
for
this
fencing
meet
with
McBurney
School
.
Only
,
we
did
n't
have
the
meet
.
I
left
all
the
foils
and
equipment
and
stuff
on
the
goddam
subway
.
It
was
n't
all
my
fault
.
I
had
to
keep
getting
up
to
look
at
this
map
,
so
we
'd
know
where
to
get
off
.
So
we
got
back
to
Pencey
around
two-thirty
instead
of
around
dinnertime
.
The
whole
team
ostracized
me
the
whole
way
back
on
the
train
.
It
was
pretty
funny
,
in
a
way
.
The
other
reason
I
was
n't
down
at
the
game
was
because
I
was
on
my
way
to
say
good-by
to
old
Spencer
,
my
history
teacher
.
He
had
the
grippe
,
and
I
figured
I
probably
would
n't
see
him
again
till
Christmas
vacation
started
.
He
wrote
me
this
note
saying
he
wanted
to
see
me
before
I
went
home
.
He
knew
I
was
n't
coming
back
to
Pencey
.
I
forgot
to
tell
you
about
that
.
They
kicked
me
out
.
I
was
n't
supposed
to
come
back
after
Christmas
vacation
on
account
of
I
was
flunking
four
subjects
and
not
applying
myself
and
all
.
They
gave
me
frequent
warning
to
start
applying
myself
--
especially
around
midterms
,
when
my
parents
came
up
for
a
conference
with
old
Thurmer
--
but
I
did
n't
do
it
.
So
I
got
the
ax
.
They
give
guys
the
ax
quite
frequently
at
Pencey
.
It
has
a
very
good
academic
rating
,
Pencey
.
It
really
does
.
Anyway
,
it
was
December
and
all
,
and
it
was
cold
as
a
witch
's
teat
,
especially
on
top
of
that
stupid
hill
.
I
only
had
on
my
reversible
and
no
gloves
or
anything
.
The
week
before
that
,
somebody
'd
stolen
my
camel's-hair
coat
right
out
of
my
room
,
with
my
fur-
lined
gloves
right
in
the
pocket
and
all
.
Pencey
was
full
of
crooks
.
Quite
a
few
guys
came
from
these
very
wealthy
families
,
but
it
was
full
of
crooks
anyway
.
The
more
expensive
a
school
is
,
the
more
crooks
it
has
--
I
'm
not
kidding
.
Anyway
,
I
kept
standing
next
to
that
crazy
cannon
,
looking
down
at
the
game
and
freezing
my
ass
off
.
Only
,
I
was
n't
watching
the
game
too
much
.
What
I
was
really
hanging
around
for
,
I
was
trying
to
feel
some
kind
of
a
good-by
.
I
mean
I
've
left
schools
and
places
I
did
n't
even
know
I
was
leaving
them
.
I
hate
that
.
I
do
n't
care
if
it
's
a
sad
good-by
or
a
bad
goodby
,
but
when
I
leave
a
place
I
like
to
know
I
'm
leaving
it
.
If
you
do
n't
,
you
feel
even
worse
.
I
was
lucky
.
All
of
a
sudden
I
thought
of
something
that
helped
make
me
know
I
was
getting
the
hell
out
.
I
suddenly
remembered
this
time
,
in
around
October
,
that
I
and
Robert
Tichener
and
Paul
Campbell
were
chucking
a
football
around
,
in
front
of
the
academic
building
.
They
were
nice
guys
,
especially
Tichener
.
It
was
just
before
dinner
and
it
was
getting
pretty
dark
out
,
but
we
kept
chucking
the
ball
around
anyway
.
It
kept
getting
darker
and
darker
,
and
we
could
hardly
see
the
ball
any
more
,
but
we
did
n't
want
to
stop
doing
what
we
were
doing
.
Finally
we
had
to
.
This
teacher
that
taught
biology
,
Mr.
Zambesi
,
stuck
his
head
out
of
this
window
in
the
academic
building
and
told
us
to
go
back
to
the
dorm
and
get
ready
for
dinner
.
If
I
get
a
chance
to
remember
that
kind
of
stuff
,
I
can
get
a
good-by
when
I
need
one
--
at
least
,
most
of
the
time
I
can
.
As
soon
as
I
got
it
,
I
turned
around
and
started
running
down
the
other
side
of
the
hill
,
toward
old
Spencer
's
house
.
He
did
n't
live
on
the
campus
.
He
lived
on
Anthony
Wayne
Avenue
.
I
ran
all
the
way
to
the
main
gate
,
and
then
I
waited
a
second
till
I
got
my
breath
.
I
have
no
wind
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
I
'm
quite
a
heavy
smoker
,
for
one
thing
--
that
is
,
I
used
to
be
.
They
made
me
cut
it
out
.
Another
thing
,
I
grew
six
and
a
half
inches
last
year
.
That
's
also
how
I
practically
got
t.b
.
and
came
out
here
for
all
these
goddam
checkups
and
stuff
.
I
'm
pretty
healthy
,
though
.
Anyway
,
as
soon
as
I
got
my
breath
back
I
ran
across
Route
204
.
It
was
icy
as
hell
and
I
damn
near
fell
down
.
I
do
n't
even
know
what
I
was
running
for
--
I
guess
I
just
felt
like
it
.
After
I
got
across
the
road
,
I
felt
like
I
was
sort
of
disappearing
.
It
was
that
kind
of
a
crazy
afternoon
,
terrifically
cold
,
and
no
sun
out
or
anything
,
and
you
felt
like
you
were
disappearing
every
time
you
crossed
a
road
.
Boy
,
I
rang
that
doorbell
fast
when
I
got
to
old
Spencer
's
house
.
I
was
really
frozen
.
My
ears
were
hurting
and
I
could
hardly
move
my
fingers
at
all
.
``
C'mon
,
c'mon
,
''
I
said
right
out
loud
,
almost
,
``
somebody
open
the
door
.
''
Finally
old
Mrs.
Spencer
opened
.
it
.
They
did
n't
have
a
maid
or
anything
,
and
they
always
opened
the
door
themselves
.
They
did
n't
have
too
much
dough
.
``
Holden
!
''
Mrs.
Spencer
said
.
``
How
lovely
to
see
you
!
Come
in
,
dear
!
Are
you
frozen
to
death
?
''
I
think
she
was
glad
to
see
me
.
She
liked
me
.
At
least
,
I
think
she
did
.
Boy
,
did
I
get
in
that
house
fast
.
``
How
are
you
,
Mrs
.
Spencer
?
''
I
said
.
``
How
's
Mr
.
Spencer
?
''
``
Let
me
take
your
coat
,
dear
,
''
she
said
.
She
did
n't
hear
me
ask
her
how
Mr.
Spencer
was
.
She
was
sort
of
deaf
.
She
hung
up
my
coat
in
the
hall
closet
,
and
I
sort
of
brushed
my
hair
back
with
my
hand
.
I
wear
a
crew
cut
quite
frequently
and
I
never
have
to
comb
it
much
.
``
How
've
you
been
,
Mrs
.
Spencer
?
''
I
said
again
,
only
louder
,
so
she
'd
hear
me
.
``
I
've
been
just
fine
,
Holden
.
''
She
closed
the
closet
door
.
``
How
have
you
been
?
''
The
way
she
asked
me
,
I
knew
right
away
old
Spencer
'd
told
her
I
'd
been
kicked
out
.
``
Fine
,
''
I
said
.
``
How
's
Mr.
Spencer
?
He
over
his
grippe
yet
?
''
``
Over
it
!
Holden
,
he
's
behaving
like
a
perfect
--
I
do
n't
know
what
.
.
.
He
's
in
his
room
,
dear
.
Go
right
in
.
''

They
each
had
their
own
room
and
all
.
They
were
both
around
seventy
years
old
,
or
even
more
than
that
.
They
got
a
bang
out
of
things
,
though
--
in
a
haif-assed
way
,
of
course
.
I
know
that
sounds
mean
to
say
,
but
I
do
n't
mean
it
mean
.
I
just
mean
that
I
used
to
think
about
old
Spencer
quite
a
lot
,
and
if
you
thought
about
him
too
much
,
you
wondered
what
the
heck
he
was
still
living
for
.
I
mean
he
was
all
stooped
over
,
and
he
had
very
terrible
posture
,
and
in
class
,
whenever
he
dropped
a
piece
of
chalk
at
the
blackboard
,
some
guy
in
the
first
row
always
had
to
get
up
and
pick
it
up
and
hand
it
to
him
.
That
's
awful
,
in
my
opinion
.
But
if
you
thought
about
him
just
enough
and
not
too
much
,
you
could
figure
it
out
that
he
was
n't
doing
too
bad
for
himself
.
For
instance
,
one
Sunday
when
some
other
guys
and
I
were
over
there
for
hot
chocolate
,
he
showed
us
this
old
beat-up
Navajo
blanket
that
he
and
Mrs.
Spencer
'd
bought
off
some
Indian
in
Yellowstone
Park
.
You
could
tell
old
Spencer
'd
got
a
big
bang
out
of
buying
it
.
That
's
what
I
mean
.
You
take
somebody
old
as
hell
,
like
old
Spencer
,
and
they
can
get
a
big
bang
out
of
buying
a
blanket
.
His
door
was
open
,
but
I
sort
of
knocked
on
it
anyway
,
just
to
be
polite
and
all
.
I
could
see
where
he
was
sitting
.
He
was
sitting
in
a
big
leather
chair
,
all
wrapped
up
in
that
blanket
I
just
told
you
about
.
He
looked
over
at
me
when
I
knocked
.
``
Who
's
that
?
''
he
yelled
.
``
Caulfield
?
Come
in
,
boy
.
''
He
was
always
yelling
,
outside
class
.
It
got
on
your
nerves
sometimes
.
The
minute
I
went
in
,
I
was
sort
of
sorry
I
'd
come
.
He
was
reading
the
Atlantic
Monthly
,
and
there
were
pills
and
medicine
all
over
the
place
,
and
everything
smelled
like
Vicks
Nose
Drops
.
It
was
pretty
depressing
.
I
'm
not
too
crazy
about
sick
people
,
anyway
.
What
made
it
even
more
depressing
,
old
Spencer
had
on
this
very
sad
,
ratty
old
bathrobe
that
he
was
probably
born
in
or
something
.
I
do
n't
much
like
to
see
old
guys
in
their
pajamas
and
bathrobes
anyway
.
Their
bumpy
old
chests
are
always
showing
.
And
their
legs
.
Old
guys
'
legs
,
at
beaches
and
places
,
always
look
so
white
and
unhairy
.
``
Hello
,
sir
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
got
your
note
.
Thanks
a
lot
.
''
He
'd
written
me
this
note
asking
me
to
stop
by
and
say
good-by
before
vacation
started
,
on
account
of
I
was
n't
coming
back
.
``
You
did
n't
have
to
do
all
that
.
I
'd
have
come
over
to
say
good-by
anyway
.
''
``
Have
a
seat
there
,
boy
,
''
old
Spencer
said
.
He
meant
the
bed
.
I
sat
down
on
it
.
``
How
's
your
grippe
,
sir
?
''
``
M'boy
,
if
I
felt
any
better
I
'd
have
to
send
for
the
doctor
,
''
old
Spencer
said
.
That
knocked
him
out
.
He
started
chuckling
like
a
madman
.
Then
he
finally
straightened
himself
out
and
said
,
``
Why
are
n't
you
down
at
the
game
?
I
thought
this
was
the
day
of
the
big
game
.
''
``
It
is
.
I
was
.
Only
,
I
just
got
back
from
New
York
with
the
fencing
team
,
''
I
said
.
Boy
,
his
bed
was
like
a
rock
.
He
started
getting
serious
as
hell
.
I
knew
he
would
.
``
So
you
're
leaving
us
,
eh
?
''
he
said
.
``
Yes
,
sir
.
I
guess
I
am
.
''
He
started
going
into
this
nodding
routine
.
You
never
saw
anybody
nod
as
much
in
your
life
as
old
Spencer
did
.
You
never
knew
if
he
was
nodding
a
lot
because
he
was
thinking
and
all
,
or
just
because
he
was
a
nice
old
guy
that
did
n't
know
his
ass
from
his
elbow
.
``
What
did
Dr.
Thurmer
say
to
you
,
boy
?
I
understand
you
had
quite
a
little
chat
.
''
``
Yes
,
we
did
.
We
really
did
.
I
was
in
his
office
for
around
two
hours
,
I
guess
.
''
``
What
'd
he
say
to
you
?
''
``
Oh
.
.
.
well
,
about
Life
being
a
game
and
all
.
And
how
you
should
play
it
according
to
the
rules
.
He
was
pretty
nice
about
it
.
I
mean
he
did
n't
hit
the
ceiling
or
anything
.
He
just
kept
talking
about
Life
being
a
game
and
all
.
You
know
.
''
``
Life
is
a
game
,
boy
.
Life
is
a
game
that
one
plays
according
to
the
rules
.
''
``
Yes
,
sir
.
I
know
it
is
.
I
know
it
.
''
Game
,
my
ass
.
Some
game
.
If
you
get
on
the
side
where
all
the
hot-shots
are
,
then
it
's
a
game
,
all
right
--
I
'll
admit
that
.
But
if
you
get
on
the
other
side
,
where
there
are
n't
any
hot-shots
,
then
what
's
a
game
about
it
?
Nothing
.
No
game
.
``
Has
Dr.
Thurmer
written
to
your
parents
yet
?
''
old
Spencer
asked
me
.
``
He
said
he
was
going
to
write
them
Monday
.
''
``
Have
you
yourself
communicated
with
them
?
''
``
No
,
sir
,
I
have
n't
communicated
with
them
,
because
I
'll
probably
see
them
Wednesday
night
when
I
get
home
.
''
``
And
how
do
you
think
they
'll
take
the
news
?
''
``
Well
.
.
.
they
'll
be
pretty
irritated
about
it
,
''
I
said
.
``
They
really
will
.
This
is
about
the
fourth
school
I
've
gone
to
.
''
I
shook
my
head
.
I
shake
my
head
quite
a
lot
.
``
Boy
!
''
I
said
.
I
also
say
``
Boy
!
''
quite
a
lot
.
Partly
because
I
have
a
lousy
vocabulary
and
partly
because
I
act
quite
young
for
my
age
sometimes
.
I
was
sixteen
then
,
and
I
'm
seventeen
now
,
and
sometimes
I
act
like
I
'm
about
thirteen
.
It
's
really
ironical
,
because
I
'm
six
foot
two
and
a
half
and
I
have
gray
hair
.
I
really
do
.
The
one
side
of
my
head
--
the
right
side
--
is
full
of
millions
of
gray
hairs
.
I
've
had
them
ever
since
I
was
a
kid
.
And
yet
I
still
act
sometimes
like
I
was
only
about
twelve
.
Everybody
says
that
,
especially
my
father
.
It
's
partly
true
,
too
,
but
it
is
n't
all
true
.
People
always
think
something
's
all
true
.
I
do
n't
give
a
damn
,
except
that
I
get
bored
sometimes
when
people
tell
me
to
act
my
age
.
Sometimes
I
act
a
lot
older
than
I
am
--
I
really
do
--
but
people
never
notice
it
.
People
never
notice
anything
.
Old
Spencer
started
nodding
again
.
He
also
started
picking
his
nose
.
He
made
out
like
he
was
only
pinching
it
,
but
he
was
really
getting
the
old
thumb
right
in
there
.
I
guess
he
thought
it
was
all
right
to
do
because
it
was
only
me
that
was
in
the
room
.
I
did
n't
care
,
except
that
it
's
pretty
disgusting
to
watch
somebody
pick
their
nose
.
Then
he
said
,
``
I
had
the
privilege
of
meeting
your
mother
and
dad
when
they
had
their
little
chat
with
Dr.
Thurmer
some
weeks
ago
.
They
're
grand
people
.
''
``
Yes
,
they
are
.
They
're
very
nice
.
''
Grand
.
There
's
a
word
I
really
hate
.
It
's
a
phony
.
I
could
puke
every
time
I
hear
it
.
Then
all
of
a
sudden
old
Spencer
looked
like
he
had
something
very
good
,
something
sharp
as
a
tack
,
to
say
to
me
.
He
sat
up
more
in
his
chair
and
sort
of
moved
around
.
It
was
a
false
alarm
,
though
.
All
he
did
was
lift
the
Atlantic
Monthly
off
his
lap
and
try
to
chuck
it
on
the
bed
,
next
to
me
.
He
missed
.
It
was
only
about
two
inches
away
,
but
he
missed
anyway
.
I
got
up
and
picked
it
up
and
put
it
down
on
the
bed
.
All
of
a
sudden
then
,
I
wanted
to
get
the
hell
out
of
the
room
.
I
could
feel
a
terrific
lecture
coming
on
.
I
did
n't
mind
the
idea
so
much
,
but
I
did
n't
feel
like
being
lectured
to
and
smell
Vicks
Nose
Drops
and
look
at
old
Spencer
in
his
pajamas
and
bathrobe
all
at
the
same
time
.
I
really
did
n't
.
It
started
,
all
right
.
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you
,
boy
?
''
old
Spencer
said
.
He
said
it
pretty
tough
,
too
,
for
him
.
``
How
many
subjects
did
you
carry
this
term
?
''
``
Five
,
sir
.
''
``
Five
.
And
how
many
are
you
failing
in
?
''
``
Four
.
''
I
moved
my
ass
a
little
bit
on
the
bed
.
It
was
the
hardest
bed
I
ever
sat
on
.
``
I
passed
English
all
right
,
''
I
said
,
``
because
I
had
all
that
Beowulf
and
Lord
Randal
My
Son
stuff
when
I
was
at
the
Whooton
School
.
I
mean
I
did
n't
have
to
do
any
work
in
English
at
all
hardly
,
except
write
compositions
once
in
a
while
.
''
He
was
n't
even
listening
.
He
hardly
ever
listened
to
you
when
you
said
something
.
``
I
flunked
you
in
history
because
you
knew
absolutely
nothing
.
''
``
I
know
that
,
sir
.
Boy
,
I
know
it
.
You
could
n't
help
it
.
''
``
Absolutely
nothing
,
''
he
said
over
again
.
That
's
something
that
drives
me
crazy
.
When
people
say
something
twice
that
way
,
after
you
admit
it
the
first
time
.
Then
he
said
it
three
times
.
``
But
absolutely
nothing
.
I
doubt
very
much
if
you
opened
your
textbook
even
once
the
whole
term
.
Did
you
?
Tell
the
truth
,
boy
.
''
``
Well
,
I
sort
of
glanced
through
it
a
couple
of
times
,
''
I
told
him
.
I
did
n't
want
to
hurt
his
feelings
.
He
was
mad
about
history
.
``
You
glanced
through
it
,
eh
?
''
he
said
--
very
sarcastic
.
``
Your
,
ah
,
exam
paper
is
over
there
on
top
of
my
chiffonier
.
On
top
of
the
pile
.
Bring
it
here
,
please
.
''
It
was
a
very
dirty
trick
,
but
I
went
over
and
brought
it
over
to
him
--
I
did
n't
have
any
alternative
or
anything
.
Then
I
sat
down
on
his
cement
bed
again
.
Boy
,
you
ca
n't
imagine
how
sorry
I
was
getting
that
I
'd
stopped
by
to
say
good-by
to
him
.
He
started
handling
my
exam
paper
like
it
was
a
turd
or
something
.
``
We
studied
the
Egyptians
from
November
4th
to
December
2nd
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
chose
to
write
about
them
for
the
optional
essay
question
.
Would
you
care
to
hear
what
you
had
to
say
?
''
``
No
,
sir
,
not
very
much
,
''
I
said
.
He
read
it
anyway
,
though
.
You
ca
n't
stop
a
teacher
when
they
want
to
do
something
.
They
just
do
it
.
The
Egyptians
were
an
ancient
race
of
Caucasians
residing
in
one
of
the
northern
sections
of
Africa
.
The
latter
as
we
all
know
is
the
largest
continent
in
the
Eastern
Hemisphere
.
I
had
to
sit
there
and
listen
to
that
crap
.
It
certainly
was
a
dirty
trick
.
The
Egyptians
are
extremely
interesting
to
us
today
for
various
reasons
.
Modern
science
would
still
like
to
know
what
the
secret
ingredients
were
that
the
Egyptians
used
when
they
wrapped
up
dead
people
so
that
their
faces
would
not
rot
for
innumerable
centuries
.
This
interesting
riddle
is
still
quite
a
challenge
to
modern
science
in
the
twentieth
century
.
He
stopped
reading
and
put
my
paper
down
.
I
was
beginning
to
sort
of
hate
him
.
``
Your
essay
,
shall
we
say
,
ends
there
,
''
he
said
in
this
very
sarcastic
voice
.
You
would
n't
think
such
an
old
guy
would
be
so
sarcastic
and
all
.
``
However
,
you
dropped
me
a
little
note
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
know
I
did
,
''
I
said
.
I
said
it
very
fast
because
I
wanted
to
stop
him
before
he
started
reading
that
out
loud
.
But
you
could
n't
stop
him
.
He
was
hot
as
a
firecracker
.
DEAR
MR.
SPENCER
[
he
read
out
loud
]
.
That
is
all
I
know
about
the
Egyptians
.
I
ca
n't
seem
to
get
very
interested
in
them
although
your
lectures
are
very
interesting
.
It
is
all
right
with
me
if
you
flunk
me
though
as
I
am
flunking
everything
else
except
English
anyway
.
Respectfully
yours
,
HOLDEN
CAULFIELD
.
He
put
my
goddam
paper
down
then
and
looked
at
me
like
he
'd
just
beaten
hell
out
of
me
in
ping-pong
or
something
.
I
do
n't
think
I
'll
ever
forgive
him
for
reading
me
that
crap
out
loud
.
I
wouldn't
've
read
it
out
loud
to
him
if
he
'd
written
it
--
I
really
would
n't
.
In
the
first
place
,
I
'd
only
written
that
damn
note
so
that
he
would
n't
feel
too
bad
about
flunking
me
.
``
Do
you
blame
me
for
flunking
you
,
boy
?
''
he
said
.
``
No
,
sir
!
I
certainly
do
n't
,
''
I
said
.
I
wished
to
hell
he
'd
stop
calling
me
``
boy
''
all
the
time
.
He
tried
chucking
my
exam
paper
on
the
bed
when
he
was
through
with
it
.
Only
,
he
missed
again
,
naturally
.
I
had
to
get
up
again
and
pick
it
up
and
put
it
on
top
of
the
Atlantic
Monthly
.
It
's
boring
to
do
that
every
two
minutes
.
``
What
would
you
have
done
in
my
place
?
''
he
said
.
``
Tell
the
truth
,
boy
.
''
Well
,
you
could
see
he
really
felt
pretty
lousy
about
flunking
me
.
So
I
shot
the
bull
for
a
while
.
I
told
him
I
was
a
real
moron
,
and
all
that
stuff
.
I
told
him
how
I
would
've
done
exactly
the
same
thing
if
I
'd
been
in
his
place
,
and
how
most
people
did
n't
appreciate
how
tough
it
is
being
a
teacher
.
That
kind
of
stuff
.
The
old
bull
.
The
funny
thing
is
,
though
,
I
was
sort
of
thinking
of
something
else
while
I
shot
the
bull
.
I
live
in
New
York
,
and
I
was
thinking
about
the
lagoon
in
Central
Park
,
down
near
Central
Park
South
.
I
was
wondering
if
it
would
be
frozen
over
when
I
got
home
,
and
if
it
was
,
where
did
the
ducks
go
.
I
was
wondering
where
the
ducks
went
when
the
lagoon
got
all
icy
and
frozen
over
.
I
wondered
if
some
guy
came
in
a
truck
and
took
them
away
to
a
zoo
or
something
.
Or
if
they
just
flew
away
.
I
'm
lucky
,
though
.
I
mean
I
could
shoot
the
old
bull
to
old
Spencer
and
think
about
those
ducks
at
the
same
time
.
It
's
funny
.
You
do
n't
have
to
think
too
hard
when
you
talk
to
a
teacher
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
though
,
he
interrupted
me
while
I
was
shooting
the
bull
.
He
was
always
interrupting
you
.
``
How
do
you
feel
about
all
this
,
boy
?
I
'd
be
very
interested
to
know
.
Very
interested
.
''
``
You
mean
about
my
flunking
out
of
Pencey
and
all
?
''
I
said
.
I
sort
of
wished
he
'd
cover
up
his
bumpy
chest
.
It
was
n't
such
a
beautiful
view
.
``
If
I
'm
not
mistaken
,
I
believe
you
also
had
some
difficulty
at
the
Whooton
School
and
at
Elkton
Hills
.
''
He
did
n't
say
it
just
sarcastic
,
but
sort
of
nasty
,
too
.
``
I
did
n't
have
too
much
difficulty
at
Elkton
Hills
,
''
I
told
him
.
``
I
did
n't
exactly
flunk
out
or
anything
.
I
just
quit
,
sort
of
.
''
``
Why
,
may
I
ask
?
''
``
Why
?
Oh
,
well
it
's
a
long
story
,
sir
.
I
mean
it
's
pretty
complicated
.
''
I
did
n't
feel
like
going
into
the
whole
thing
with
him
.
He
would
n't
have
understood
it
anyway
.
It
was
n't
up
his
alley
at
all
.
One
of
the
biggest
reasons
I
left
Elkton
Hills
was
because
I
was
surrounded
by
phonies
.
That
's
all
.
They
were
coming
in
the
goddam
window
.
For
instance
,
they
had
this
headmaster
,
Mr.
Haas
,
that
was
the
phoniest
bastard
I
ever
met
in
my
life
.
Ten
times
worse
than
old
Thurmer
.
On
Sundays
,
for
instance
,
old
Haas
went
around
shaking
hands
with
everybody
's
parents
when
they
drove
up
to
school
.
He
'd
be
charming
as
hell
and
all
.
Except
if
some
boy
had
little
old
funny-looking
parents
.
You
should
've
seen
the
way
he
did
with
my
roommate
's
parents
.
I
mean
if
a
boy
's
mother
was
sort
of
fat
or
corny-looking
or
something
,
and
if
somebody
's
father
was
one
of
those
guys
that
wear
those
suits
with
very
big
shoulders
and
corny
black-and-white
shoes
,
then
old
Hans
would
just
shake
hands
with
them
and
give
them
a
phony
smile
and
then
he
'd
go
talk
,
for
maybe
a
half
an
hour
,
with
somebody
else
's
parents
.
I
ca
n't
stand
that
stuff
.
It
drives
me
crazy
.
It
makes
me
so
depressed
I
go
crazy
.
I
hated
that
goddam
Elkton
Hills
.
Old
Spencer
asked
me
something
then
,
but
I
did
n't
hear
him
.
I
was
thinking
about
old
Haas
.
``
What
,
sir
?
''
I
said
.
``
Do
you
have
any
particular
qualms
about
leaving
Pencey
?
''
``
Oh
,
I
have
a
few
qualms
,
all
right
.
Sure
.
.
.
but
not
too
many
.
Not
yet
,
anyway
.
I
guess
it
has
n't
really
hit
me
yet
.
It
takes
things
a
while
to
hit
me
.
All
I
'm
doing
right
now
is
thinking
about
going
home
Wednesday
.
I
'm
a
moron
.
''
``
Do
you
feel
absolutely
no
concern
for
your
future
,
boy
?
''
``
Oh
,
I
feel
some
concern
for
my
future
,
all
right
.
Sure
.
Sure
,
I
do
.
''
I
thought
about
it
for
a
minute
.
``
But
not
too
much
,
I
guess
.
Not
too
much
,
I
guess
.
''
``
You
will
,
''
old
Spencer
said
.
``
You
will
,
boy
.
You
will
when
it
's
too
late
.
''
I
did
n't
like
hearing
him
say
that
.
It
made
me
sound
dead
or
something
.
It
was
very
depressing
.
``
I
guess
I
will
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
'd
like
to
put
some
sense
in
that
head
of
yours
,
boy
.
I
'm
trying
to
help
you
.
I
'm
trying
to
help
you
,
if
I
can
.
''
He
really
was
,
too
.
You
could
see
that
.
But
it
was
just
that
we
were
too
much
on
opposite
sides
ot
the
pole
,
that
's
all
.
``
I
know
you
are
,
sir
,
''
I
said
.
``
Thanks
a
lot
.
No
kidding
.
I
appreciate
it
.
I
really
do
.
''
I
got
up
from
the
bed
then
.
Boy
,
I
couldn't
've
sat
there
another
ten
minutes
to
save
my
life
.
``
The
thing
is
,
though
,
I
have
to
get
going
now
.
I
have
quite
a
bit
of
equipment
at
the
gym
I
have
to
get
to
take
home
with
me
.
I
really
do
.
''
He
looked
up
at
me
and
started
nodding
again
,
with
this
very
serious
look
on
his
face
.
I
felt
sorry
as
hell
for
him
,
all
of
a
sudden
.
But
I
just
could
n't
hang
around
there
any
longer
,
the
way
we
were
on
opposite
sides
of
the
pole
,
and
the
way
he
kept
missing
the
bed
whenever
he
chucked
something
at
it
,
and
his
sad
old
bathrobe
with
his
chest
showing
,
and
that
grippy
smell
of
Vicks
Nose
Drops
all
over
the
place
.
``
Look
,
sir
.
Do
n't
worry
about
me
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
mean
it
.
I
'll
be
all
right
.
I
'm
just
going
through
a
phase
right
now
.
Everybody
goes
through
phases
and
all
,
do
n't
they
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
,
boy
.
I
do
n't
know
.
''
I
hate
it
when
somebody
answers
that
way
.
``
Sure
.
Sure
,
they
do
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
mean
it
,
sir
.
Please
do
n't
worry
about
me
.
''
I
sort
of
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
``
Okay
?
''
I
said
.
``
Would
n't
you
like
a
cup
of
hot
chocolate
before
you
go
?
Mrs.
Spencer
would
be-
-
''
``
I
would
,
I
really
would
,
but
the
thing
is
,
I
have
to
get
going
.
I
have
to
go
right
to
the
gym
.
Thanks
,
though
.
Thanks
a
lot
,
sir
.
''
Then
we
shook
hands
.
And
all
that
crap
.
It
made
me
feel
sad
as
hell
,
though
.
``
I
'll
drop
you
a
line
,
sir
.
Take
care
of
your
grippe
,
now
.
''
``
Good-by
,
boy
.
''
After
I
shut
the
door
and
started
back
to
the
living
room
,
he
yelled
something
at
me
,
but
I
could
n't
exactly
hear
him
.
I
'm
pretty
sure
he
yelled
``
Good
luck
!
''
at
me
,
I
hope
to
hell
not
.
I
'd
never
yell
``
Good
luck
!
''
at
anybody
.
It
sounds
terrible
,
when
you
think
about
it
.
3
I
'm
the
most
terrific
liar
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
.
It
's
awful
.
If
I
'm
on
my
way
to
the
store
to
buy
a
magazine
,
even
,
and
somebody
asks
me
where
I
'm
going
,
I
'm
liable
to
say
I
'm
going
to
the
opera
.
It
's
terrible
.
So
when
I
told
old
Spencer
I
had
to
go
to
the
gym
and
get
my
equipment
and
stuff
,
that
was
a
sheer
lie
.
I
do
n't
even
keep
my
goddam
equipment
in
the
gym
.
Where
I
lived
at
Pencey
,
I
lived
in
the
Ossenburger
Memorial
Wing
of
the
new
dorms
.
It
was
only
for
juniors
and
seniors
.
I
was
a
junior
.
My
roommate
was
a
senior
.
It
was
named
after
this
guy
Ossenburger
that
went
to
Pencey
.
He
made
a
pot
of
dough
in
the
undertaking
business
after
he
got
out
of
Pencey
.
What
he
did
,
he
started
these
undertaking
parlors
all
over
the
country
that
you
could
get
members
of
your
family
buried
for
about
five
bucks
apiece
.
You
should
see
old
Ossenburger
.
He
probably
just
shoves
them
in
a
sack
and
dumps
them
in
the
river
.
Anyway
,
he
gave
Pencey
a
pile
of
dough
,
and
they
named
our
wing
alter
him
.
The
first
football
game
of
the
year
,
he
came
up
to
school
in
this
big
goddam
Cadillac
,
and
we
all
had
to
stand
up
in
the
grandstand
and
give
him
a
locomotive
--
that
's
a
cheer
.
Then
,
the
next
morning
,
in
chapel
,
be
made
a
speech
that
lasted
about
ten
hours
.
He
started
off
with
about
fifty
corny
jokes
,
just
to
show
us
what
a
regular
guy
he
was
.
Very
big
deal
.
Then
he
started
telling
us
how
he
was
never
ashamed
,
when
he
was
in
some
kind
of
trouble
or
something
,
to
get
right
down
his
knees
and
pray
to
God
.
He
told
us
we
should
always
pray
to
God
--
talk
to
Him
and
all
--
wherever
we
were
.
He
told
us
we
ought
to
think
of
Jesus
as
our
buddy
and
all
.
He
said
he
talked
to
Jesus
all
the
time
.
Even
when
he
was
driving
his
car
.
That
killed
me
.
I
just
see
the
big
phony
bastard
shifting
into
first
gear
and
asking
Jesus
to
send
him
a
few
more
stiffs
.
The
only
good
part
of
his
speech
was
right
in
the
middle
of
it
.
He
was
telling
us
all
about
what
a
swell
guy
he
was
,
what
a
hot-shot
and
all
,
then
all
of
a
sudden
this
guy
sitting
in
the
row
in
front
of
me
,
Edgar
Marsalla
,
laid
this
terrific
fart
.
It
was
a
very
crude
thing
to
do
,
in
chapel
and
all
,
but
it
was
also
quite
amusing
.
Old
Marsalla
.
He
damn
near
blew
the
roof
off
.
Hardly
anybody
laughed
out
loud
,
and
old
Ossenburger
made
out
like
he
did
n't
even
hear
it
,
but
old
Thurmer
,
the
headmaster
,
was
sitting
right
next
to
him
on
the
rostrum
and
all
,
and
you
could
tell
he
heard
it
.
Boy
,
was
he
sore
.
He
did
n't
say
anything
then
,
but
the
next
night
he
made
us
have
compulsory
study
hall
in
the
academic
building
and
he
came
up
and
made
a
speech
.
He
said
that
the
boy
that
had
created
the
disturbance
in
chapel
was
n't
fit
to
go
to
Pencey
.
We
tried
to
get
old
Marsalla
to
rip
off
another
one
,
right
while
old
Thurmer
was
making
his
speech
,
but
be
was
n't
in
the
right
mood
.
Anyway
,
that
's
where
I
lived
at
Pencey
.
Old
Ossenburger
Memorial
Wing
,
in
the
new
dorms
.
It
was
pretty
nice
to
get
back
to
my
room
,
after
I
left
old
Spencer
,
because
everybody
was
down
at
the
game
,
and
the
heat
was
on
in
our
room
,
for
a
change
.
It
felt
sort
of
cosy
.
I
took
off
my
coat
and
my
tie
and
unbuttoned
my
shirt
collar
;
and
then
I
put
on
this
hat
that
I
'd
bought
in
New
York
that
morning
.
It
was
this
red
hunting
hat
,
with
one
of
those
very
,
very
long
peaks
.
I
saw
it
in
the
window
of
this
sports
store
when
we
got
out
of
the
subway
,
just
after
I
noticed
I
'd
lost
all
the
goddam
foils
.
It
only
cost
me
a
buck
.
The
way
I
wore
it
,
I
swung
the
old
peak
way
around
to
the
back
--
very
corny
,
I
'll
admit
,
but
I
liked
it
that
way
.
I
looked
good
in
it
that
way
.
Then
I
got
this
book
I
was
reading
and
sat
down
in
my
chair
.
There
were
two
chairs
in
every
room
.
I
had
one
and
my
roommate
,
Ward
Stradlater
,
had
one
.
The
arms
were
in
sad
shape
,
because
everybody
was
always
sitting
on
them
,
but
they
were
pretty
comfortable
chairs
.
The
book
I
was
reading
was
this
book
I
took
out
of
the
library
by
mistake
.
They
gave
me
the
wrong
book
,
and
I
did
n't
notice
it
till
I
got
back
to
my
room
.
They
gave
me
Out
of
Africa
,
by
Isak
Dinesen
.
I
thought
it
was
going
to
stink
,
but
it
did
n't
.
It
was
a
very
good
book
.
I
'm
quite
illiterate
,
but
I
read
a
lot
.
My
favorite
author
is
my
brother
D.B.
,
and
my
next
favorite
is
Ring
Lardner
.
My
brother
gave
me
a
book
by
Ring
Lardner
for
my
birthday
,
just
before
I
went
to
Pencey
.
It
had
these
very
funny
,
crazy
plays
in
it
,
and
then
it
had
this
one
story
about
a
traffic
cop
that
falls
in
love
with
this
very
cute
girl
that
's
always
speeding
.
Only
,
he
's
married
,
the
cop
,
so
be
ca
n't
marry
her
or
anything
.
Then
this
girl
gets
killed
,
because
she
's
always
speeding
.
That
story
just
about
killed
me
.
What
I
like
best
is
a
book
that
's
at
least
funny
once
in
a
while
.
I
read
a
lot
of
classical
books
,
like
The
Return
of
the
Native
and
all
,
and
I
like
them
,
and
I
read
a
lot
of
war
books
and
mysteries
and
all
,
but
they
do
n't
knock
me
out
too
much
.
What
really
knocks
me
out
is
a
book
that
,
when
you
're
all
done
reading
it
,
you
wish
the
author
that
wrote
it
was
a
terrific
friend
of
yours
and
you
could
call
him
up
on
the
phone
whenever
you
felt
like
it
.
That
does
n't
happen
much
,
though
.
I
would
n't
mind
calling
this
Isak
Dinesen
up
.
And
Ring
Lardner
,
except
that
D.B
.
told
me
he
's
dead
.
You
take
that
book
Of
Human
Bondage
,
by
Somerset
Maugham
,
though
.
I
read
it
last
summer
.
It
's
a
pretty
good
book
and
all
,
but
I
would
n't
want
to
call
Somerset
Maugham
up
.
I
do
n't
know
,
He
just
is
n't
the
kind
of
guy
I
'd
want
to
call
up
,
that
's
all
.
I
'd
rather
call
old
Thomas
Hardy
up
.
I
like
that
Eustacia
Vye
.
Anyway
,
I
put
on
my
new
hat
and
sat
down
and
started
reading
that
book
Out
of
Africa
.
I
'd
read
it
already
,
but
I
wanted
to
read
certain
parts
over
again
.
I
'd
only
read
about
three
pages
,
though
,
when
I
heard
somebody
coming
through
the
shower
curtains
.
Even
without
looking
up
,
I
knew
right
away
who
it
was
.
It
was
Robert
Ackley
,
this
guy
that
roomed
right
next
to
me
.
There
was
a
shower
right
between
every
two
rooms
in
our
wing
,
and
about
eighty-five
times
a
day
old
Ackley
barged
in
on
me
.
He
was
probably
the
only
guy
in
the
whole
dorm
,
besides
me
,
that
was
n't
down
at
the
game
.
He
hardly
ever
went
anywhere
.
He
was
a
very
peculiar
guy
.
He
was
a
senior
,
and
he
'd
been
at
Pencey
the
whole
four
years
and
all
,
but
nobody
ever
called
him
anything
except
``
Ackley
.
''
Not
even
Herb
Gale
,
his
own
roommate
,
ever
called
him
``
Bob
''
or
even
``
Ack
.
''
If
he
ever
gets
married
,
his
own
wife
'll
probably
call
him
``
Ackley
.
''
He
was
one
of
these
very
,
very
tall
,
round-shouldered
guys
--
he
was
about
six
four
--
with
lousy
teeth
.
The
whole
time
he
roomed
next
to
me
,
I
never
even
once
saw
him
brush
his
teeth
.
They
always
looked
mossy
and
awful
,
and
he
damn
near
made
you
sick
if
you
saw
him
in
the
dining
room
with
his
mouth
full
of
mashed
potatoes
and
peas
or
something
.
Besides
that
,
he
had
a
lot
of
pimples
.
Not
just
on
his
forehead
or
his
chin
,
like
most
guys
,
but
all
over
his
whole
face
.
And
not
only
that
,
he
had
a
terrible
personality
.
He
was
also
sort
of
a
nasty
guy
.
I
was
n't
too
crazy
about
him
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
.
I
could
feel
him
standing
on
the
shower
ledge
,
right
behind
my
chair
,
taking
a
look
to
see
if
Stradlater
was
around
.
He
hated
Stradlater
's
guts
and
he
never
came
in
the
room
if
Stradlater
was
around
.
He
hated
everybody
's
guts
,
damn
near
.
He
came
down
off
the
shower
ledge
and
came
in
the
room
.
``
Hi
,
''
he
said
.
He
always
said
it
like
he
was
terrifically
bored
or
terrifically
tired
.
He
did
n't
want
you
to
think
he
was
visiting
you
or
anything
.
He
wanted
you
to
think
he
'd
come
in
by
mistake
,
for
God
's
sake
.
``
Hi
,
''
I
said
,
but
I
did
n't
look
up
from
my
book
.
With
a
guy
like
Ackley
,
if
you
looked
up
from
your
book
you
were
a
goner
.
You
were
a
goner
anyway
,
but
not
as
quick
if
you
did
n't
look
up
right
away
.
He
started
walking
around
the
room
,
very
slow
and
all
,
the
way
he
always
did
,
picking
up
your
personal
stuff
off
your
desk
and
chiffonier
.
He
always
picked
up
your
personal
stuff
and
looked
at
it
.
Boy
,
could
he
get
on
your
nerves
sometimes
.
``
How
was
the
fencing
?
''
he
said
.
He
just
wanted
me
to
quit
reading
and
enjoying
myself
.
He
did
n't
give
a
damn
about
the
fencing
.
``
We
win
,
or
what
?
''
he
said
.
``
Nobody
won
,
''
I
said
.
Without
looking
up
,
though
.
``
What
?
''
he
said
.
He
always
made
you
say
everything
twice
.
``
Nobody
won
,
''
I
said
.
I
sneaked
a
look
to
see
what
he
was
fiddling
around
with
on
my
chiffonier
.
He
was
looking
at
this
picture
of
this
girl
I
used
to
go
around
with
in
New
York
,
Sally
Hayes
.
He
must
've
picked
up
that
goddam
picture
and
looked
at
it
at
least
five
thousand
times
since
I
got
it
.
He
always
put
it
back
in
the
wrong
place
,
too
,
when
he
was
finished
.
He
did
it
on
purpose
.
You
could
tell
.
``
Nobody
won
,
''
he
said
.
``
How
come
?
''
``
I
left
the
goddam
foils
and
stuff
on
the
subway
.
''
I
still
did
n't
look
up
at
him
.
``
On
the
subway
,
for
Chrissake
!
Ya
lost
them
,
ya
mean
?
''
``
We
got
on
the
wrong
subway
.
I
had
to
keep
getting
up
to
look
at
a
goddam
map
on
the
wall
.
''
He
came
over
and
stood
right
in
my
light
.
``
Hey
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
've
read
this
same
sentence
about
twenty
times
since
you
came
in
.
''
Anybody
else
except
Ackley
would
've
taken
the
goddam
hint
.
Not
him
,
though
.
``
Think
they
'll
make
ya
pay
for
em
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
do
n't
know
,
and
I
do
n't
give
a
damn
.
How
'bout
sitting
down
or
something
,
Ackley
kid
?
You
're
right
in
my
goddam
light
.
''
He
did
n't
like
it
when
you
called
him
``
Ackley
kid
.
''
He
was
always
telling
me
I
was
a
goddam
kid
,
because
I
was
sixteen
and
he
was
eighteen
.
It
drove
him
mad
when
I
called
him
``
Ackley
kid
.
''
He
kept
standing
there
.
He
was
exactly
the
kind
of
a
guy
that
would
n't
get
out
of
your
light
when
you
asked
him
to
.
He
'd
do
it
,
finally
,
but
it
took
him
a
lot
longer
if
you
asked
him
to
.
``
What
the
hellya
reading
?
''
he
said
.
``
Goddam
book
.
''
He
shoved
my
book
back
with
his
hand
so
that
he
could
see
the
name
of
it
.
``
Any
good
?
''
he
said
.
``
This
sentence
I
'm
reading
is
terrific
.
''
I
can
be
quite
sarcastic
when
I
'm
in
the
mood
.
He
did
n't
get
It
,
though
.
He
started
walking
around
the
room
again
,
picking
up
all
my
personal
stuff
,
and
Stradlater
's
.
Finally
,
I
put
my
book
down
on
the
floor
.
You
could
n't
read
anything
with
a
guy
like
Ackley
around
.
It
was
impossible
.
I
slid
way
the
hell
down
in
my
chair
and
watched
old
Ackley
making
himself
at
home
.
I
was
feeling
sort
of
tired
from
the
trip
to
New
York
and
all
,
and
I
started
yawning
.
Then
I
started
horsing
around
a
little
bit
.
Sometimes
I
horse
around
quite
a
lot
,
just
to
keep
from
getting
bored
.
What
I
did
was
,
I
pulled
the
old
peak
of
my
hunting
hat
around
to
the
front
,
then
pulled
it
way
down
over
my
eyes
.
That
way
,
I
could
n't
see
a
goddam
thing
.
``
I
think
I
'm
going
blind
,
''
I
said
in
this
very
hoarse
voice
.
``
Mother
darling
,
everything
's
getting
so
dark
in
here
.
''
``
You
're
nuts
.
I
swear
to
God
,
''
Ackley
said
.
``
Mother
darling
,
give
me
your
hand
,
Why
wo
n't
you
give
me
your
hand
?
''
``
For
Chrissake
,
grow
up
.
''
I
started
groping
around
in
front
of
me
,
like
a
blind
guy
,
but
without
getting
up
or
anything
.
I
kept
saying
,
``
Mother
darling
,
why
wo
n't
you
give
me
your
hand
?
''
I
was
only
horsing
around
,
naturally
.
That
stuff
gives
me
a
bang
sometimes
.
Besides
,
I
know
it
annoyed
hell
out
of
old
Ackley
.
He
always
brought
out
the
old
sadist
in
me
.
I
was
pretty
sadistic
with
him
quite
often
.
Finally
,
I
quit
,
though
.
I
pulled
the
peak
around
to
the
back
again
,
and
relaxed
.
``
Who
belongsa
this
?
''
Ackley
said
.
He
was
holding
my
roommate
's
knee
supporter
up
to
show
me
.
That
guy
Ackley
'd
pick
up
anything
.
He
'd
even
pick
up
your
jock
strap
or
something
.
I
told
him
it
was
Stradlater
's
.
So
he
chucked
it
on
Stradlater
's
bed
.
He
got
it
off
Stradlater
's
chiffonier
,
so
he
chucked
it
on
the
bed
.
He
came
over
and
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
Stradlater
's
chair
.
He
never
sat
down
in
a
chair
.
Just
always
on
the
arm
.
``
Where
the
hellja
get
that
hat
?
''
he
said
.
``
New
York
.
''
``
How
much
?
''
``
A
buck
.
''
``
You
got
robbed
.
''
He
started
cleaning
his
goddam
fingernails
with
the
end
of
a
match
.
He
was
always
cleaning
his
fingernails
.
It
was
funny
,
in
a
way
.
His
teeth
were
always
mossy-looking
,
and
his
ears
were
always
dirty
as
hell
,
but
he
was
always
cleaning
his
fingernails
.
I
guess
he
thought
that
made
him
a
very
neat
guy
.
He
took
another
look
at
my
hat
while
he
was
cleaning
them
.
``
Up
home
we
wear
a
hat
like
that
to
shoot
deer
in
,
for
Chrissake
,
''
he
said
.
``
That
's
a
deer
shooting
hat
.
''
``
Like
hell
it
is
.
''
I
took
it
off
and
looked
at
it
.
I
sort
of
closed
one
eye
,
like
I
was
taking
aim
at
it
.
``
This
is
a
people
shooting
hat
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
shoot
people
in
this
hat
.
''
``
Your
folks
know
you
got
kicked
out
yet
?
''
``
Nope
.
''
``
Where
the
hell
's
Stradlater
at
,
anyway
?
''
``
Down
at
the
game
.
He
's
got
a
date
.
''
I
yawned
.
I
was
yawning
all
over
the
place
.
For
one
thing
,
the
room
was
too
damn
hot
.
It
made
you
sleepy
.
At
Pencey
,
you
either
froze
to
death
or
died
of
the
heat
.
``
The
great
Stradlater
,
''
Ackley
said.
``
--
Hey
.
Lend
me
your
scissors
a
second
,
willya
?
Ya
got
'em
handy
?
''
``
No
.
I
packed
them
already
.
They
're
way
in
the
top
of
the
closet
.
''
``
Get
'em
a
second
,
willya
?
''
Ackley
said
,
``
I
got
this
hangnail
I
want
to
cut
off
.
''
He
did
n't
care
if
you
'd
packed
something
or
not
and
had
it
way
in
the
top
of
the
closet
.
I
got
them
for
him
though
.
I
nearly
got
killed
doing
it
,
too
.
The
second
I
opened
the
closet
door
,
Stradlater
's
tennis
racket
--
in
its
wooden
press
and
all
--
fell
right
on
my
head
.
It
made
a
big
clunk
,
and
it
hurt
like
hell
.
It
damn
near
killed
old
Ackley
,
though
.
He
started
laughing
in
this
very
high
falsetto
voice
.
He
kept
laughing
the
whole
time
I
was
taking
down
my
suitcase
and
getting
the
scissors
out
for
him
.
Something
like
that
--
a
guy
getting
hit
on
the
head
with
a
rock
or
something
--
tickled
the
pants
off
Ackley
.
``
You
have
a
damn
good
sense
of
humor
,
Ackley
kid
,
''
I
told
him
.
``
You
know
that
?
''
I
handed
him
the
scissors
.
``
Lem
me
be
your
manager
.
I
'll
get
you
on
the
goddam
radio
.
''
I
sat
down
in
my
chair
again
,
and
he
started
cutting
his
big
horny-looking
nails
.
``
How
'bout
using
the
table
or
something
?
''
I
said
.
``
Cut
'em
over
the
table
,
willya
?
I
do
n't
feel
like
walking
on
your
crumby
nails
in
my
bare
feet
tonight
.
''
He
kept
right
on
cutting
them
over
the
floor
,
though
.
What
lousy
manners
.
I
mean
it
.
``
Who
's
Stradlater
's
date
?
''
he
said
.
He
was
always
keeping
tabs
on
who
Stradlater
was
dating
,
even
though
he
hated
Stradlater
's
guts
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Why
?
''
``
No
reason
.
Boy
,
I
ca
n't
stand
that
sonuvabitch
.
He
's
one
sonuvabitch
I
really
ca
n't
stand
.
''
``
He
's
crazy
about
you
.
He
told
me
he
thinks
you
're
a
goddam
prince
,
''
I
said
.
I
call
people
a
``
prince
''
quite
often
when
I
'm
horsing
around
.
It
keeps
me
from
getting
bored
or
something
.
``
He
's
got
this
superior
attitude
all
the
time
,
''
Ackley
said
.
``
I
just
ca
n't
stand
the
sonuvabitch
.
You
'd
think
he
--
''
``
Do
you
mind
cutting
your
nails
over
the
table
,
hey
?
''
I
said
.
``
I
've
asked
you
about
fifty
--
''
``
He
's
got
this
goddam
superior
attitude
all
the
time
,
''
Ackley
said
.
``
I
do
n't
even
think
the
sonuvabitch
is
intelligent
.
He
thinks
he
is
.
He
thinks
he
's
about
the
most
--
''
``
Ackley
!
For
Chrissake
.
Willya
please
cut
your
crumby
nails
over
the
table
?
I
've
asked
you
fifty
times
.
''
He
started
cutting
his
nails
over
the
table
,
for
a
change
.
The
only
way
he
ever
did
anything
was
if
you
yelled
at
him
.
I
watched
him
for
a
while
.
Then
I
said
,
``
The
reason
you
're
sore
at
Stradlater
is
because
he
said
that
stuff
about
brushing
your
teeth
once
in
a
while
.
He
did
n't
mean
to
insult
you
,
for
cryin
'
out
loud
.
He
did
n't
say
it
right
or
anything
,
but
he
did
n't
mean
anything
insulting
.
All
he
meant
was
you
'd
look
better
and
feel
better
if
you
sort
of
brushed
your
teeth
once
in
a
while
.
''
``
I
brush
my
teeth
.
Do
n't
gim
me
that
.
''
``
No
,
you
do
n't
.
I
've
seen
you
,
and
you
do
n't
,
''
I
said
.
I
did
n't
say
it
nasty
,
though
.
I
felt
sort
of
sorry
for
him
,
in
a
way
.
I
mean
it
is
n't
too
nice
,
naturally
,
if
somebody
tells
you
you
do
n't
brush
your
teeth
.
``
Stradlater
's
all
right
He
's
not
too
bad
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
do
n't
know
him
,
thats
the
trouble
.
''
``
I
still
say
he
's
a
sonuvabitch
.
He
's
a
conceited
sonuvabitch
.
''
``
He
's
conceited
,
but
he
's
very
generous
in
some
things
.
He
really
is
,
''
I
said
.
``
Look
.
Suppose
,
for
instance
,
Stradlater
was
wearing
a
tie
or
something
that
you
liked
.
Say
he
had
a
tie
on
that
you
liked
a
helluva
lot
--
I
'm
just
giving
you
an
example
,
now
.
You
know
what
he
'd
do
?
He
'd
probably
take
it
off
and
give
it
ta
you
.
He
really
would
.
Or
--
you
know
what
he
'd
do
?
He
'd
leave
it
on
your
bed
or
something
.
But
he
'd
give
you
the
goddam
tie
.
Most
guys
would
probably
just
--

``
Hell
,
''
Ackley
said
.
``
If
I
had
his
dough
,
I
would
,
too
.
''
``
No
,
you
would
n't
.
''
I
shook
my
head
.
``
No
,
you
would
n't

Ackley
kid
.
If
you
had
his
dough
,
you
'd
be
one
of
the
biggest
--
''
``
Stop
calling
me
'Ackley
kid
,
'
God
damn
it
.
I
'm
old
enough
to
be
your
lousy
father
.
''
``
No
,
you
're
not
.
''
Boy
,
he
could
really
be
aggravating
sometimes
.
He
never
missed
a
chance
to
let
you
know
you
were
sixteen
and
he
was
eighteen
.
``
In
the
first
place
,
I
would
n't
let
you
in
my
goddam
family
,
''
I
said
.
``
Well
,
just
cut
out
calling
me
--
''
All
of
a
sudden
the
door
opened
,
and
old
Stradlater
barged
in
,
in
a
big
hurry
.
He
was
always
in
a
big
hurry
.
Everything
was
a
very
big
deal
.
He
came
over
to
me
and
gave
me
these
two
playful
as
hell
slaps
on
both
cheeks
--
which
is
something
that
can
be
very
annoying
.
'Listen
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
going
out
anywheres
special
tonight
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
might
.
What
the
hell
's
it
doing
out
--
snowing
?
''
He
had
snow
all
over
his
coat
.
``
Yeah
.
Listen
.
If
you
're
not
going
out
anyplace
special
,
how
'bout
lending
me
your
hound's-tooth
jacket
?
''
``
Who
won
the
game
?
''
I
said
.
``
It
's
only
the
half
.
We
're
leaving
,
''
Stradlater
said
.
``
No
kidding
,
you
gon
na
use
your
hound's-tooth
tonight
or
not
?
I
spilled
some
crap
all
over
my
gray
flannel
.
''
``
No
,
but
I
do
n't
want
you
stretching
it
with
your
goddam
shoulders
and
all
,
''
I
said
.
We
were
practically
the
same
heighth
,
but
he
weighed
about
twice
as
much
as
I
did
.
He
had
these
very
broad
shoulders
.
``
I
wo
n't
stretch
it
.
''
He
went
over
to
the
closet
in
a
big
hurry
.
``
How'sa
boy
,
Ackley
?
''
he
said
to
Ackley
.
He
was
at
least
a
pretty
friendly
guy
,
Stradlater
.
It
was
partly
a
phony
kind
of
friendly
,
but
at
least
he
always
said
hello
to
Ackley
and
all
.
Ackley
just
sort
of
grunted
when
he
said
``
How'sa
boy
?
''
He
would
n't
answer
him
,
but
he
did
n't
have
guts
enough
not
to
at
least
grunt
.
Then
he
said
to
me
,
``
I
think
I
'll
get
going
.
See
ya
later
.
''
``
Okay
,
''
I
said
.
He
never
exactly
broke
your
heart
when
he
went
back
to
his
own
room
.
Old
Stradlater
started
taking
off
his
coat
and
tie
and
all
.
``
I
think
maybe
I
'll
take
a
fast
shave
,
''
he
said
.
He
had
a
pretty
heavy
beard
.
He
really
did
.
``
Where
's
your
date
?
''
I
asked
him
.
``
She
's
waiting
in
the
Annex
.
''
He
went
out
of
the
room
with
his
toilet
kit
and
towel
under
his
arm
.
No
shirt
on
or
anything
.
He
always
walked
around
in
his
bare
torso
because
he
thought
he
had
a
damn
good
build
.
He
did
,
too
.
I
have
to
admit
it
.
4
I
did
n't
have
anything
special
to
do
,
so
I
went
down
to
the
can
and
chewed
the
rag
with
him
while
he
was
shaving
.
We
were
the
only
ones
in
the
can
,
because
everybody
was
still
down
at
the
game
.
It
was
hot
as
hell
and
the
windows
were
all
steamy
.
There
were
about
ten
washbowls
,
all
right
against
the
wall
.
Stradlater
had
the
middle
one
.
I
sat
down
on
the
one
right
next
to
him
and
started
turning
the
cold
water
on
and
off
--
this
nervous
habit
I
have
.
Stradlater
kept
whistling
'Song
of
India
''
while
he
shaved
.
He
had
one
of
those
very
piercing
whistles
that
are
practically
never
in
tune
,
and
he
always
picked
out
some
song
that
's
hard
to
whistle
even
if
you
're
a
good
whistler
,
like
``
Song
of
India
''
or
``
Slaughter
on
Tenth
Avenue
.
''
He
could
really
mess
a
song
up
.
You
remember
I
said
before
that
Ackley
was
a
slob
in
his
personal
habits
?
Well
,
so
was
Stradlater
,
but
in
a
different
way
.
Stradlater
was
more
of
a
secret
slob
.
He
always
looked
all
right
,
Stradlater
,
but
for
instance
,
you
should
've
seen
the
razor
he
shaved
himself
with
.
It
was
always
rusty
as
hell
and
full
of
lather
and
hairs
and
crap
.
He
never
cleaned
it
or
anything
.
He
always
looked
good
when
he
was
finished
fixing
himself
up
,
but
he
was
a
secret
slob
anyway
,
if
you
knew
him
the
way
I
did
.
The
reason
he
fixed
himself
up
to
look
good
was
because
he
was
madly
in
love
with
himself
.
He
thought
he
was
the
handsomest
guy
in
the
Western
Hemisphere
.
He
was
pretty
handsome
,
too
--
I
'll
admit
it
.
But
he
was
mostly
the
kind
of
a
handsome
guy
that
if
your
parents
saw
his
picture
in
your
Year
Book
,
they
'd
right
away
say
,
``
Who
's
this
boy
?
''
I
mean
he
was
mostly
a
Year
Book
kind
of
handsome
guy
.
I
knew
a
lot
of
guys
at
Pencey
I
thought
were
a
lot
handsomer
than
Stradlater
,
but
they
would
n't
look
handsome
if
you
saw
their
pictures
in
the
Year
Book
.
They
'd
look
like
they
had
big
noses
or
their
ears
stuck
out
.
I
've
had
that
experience
frequently
.
Anyway
,
I
was
sitting
on
the
washbowl
next
to
where
Stradlater
was
shaving
,
sort
of
turning
the
water
on
and
off
.
I
still
had
my
red
hunting
hat
on
,
with
the
peak
around
to
the
back
and
all
.
I
really
got
a
bang
out
of
that
hat
.
``
Hey
,
''
Stradlater
said
.
``
Wan
na
do
me
a
big
favor
?
''
``
What
?
''
I
said
.
Not
too
enthusiastic
.
He
was
always
asking
you
to
do
him
a
big
favor
.
You
take
a
very
handsome
guy
,
or
a
guy
that
thinks
he
's
a
real
hot-shot
,
and
they
're
always
asking
you
to
do
them
a
big
favor
.
Just
because
they
're
crazy
about
themseif
,
they
think
you
're
crazy
about
them
,
too
,
and
that
you
're
just
dying
to
do
them
a
favor
.
It
's
sort
of
funny
,
in
a
way
.
``
You
goin
'
out
tonight
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
might
.
I
might
not
.
I
do
n't
know
.
Why
?
''
``
I
got
about
a
hundred
pages
to
read
for
history
for
Monday
,
''
he
said
.
``
How
'bout
writing
a
composition
for
me
,
for
English
?
I
'll
be
up
the
creek
if
I
do
n't
get
the
goddam
thing
in
by
Monday
,
the
reason
I
ask
.
How
'bout
it
?
''
It
was
very
ironical
.
It
really
was
.
``
I
'm
the
one
that
's
flunking
out
of
the
goddam
place
,
and
you
're
asking
me
to
write
you
a
goddam
composition
,
''
I
said
.
``
Yeah
,
I
know
.
The
thing
is
,
though
,
I
'll
be
up
the
creek
if
I
do
n't
get
it
in
.
Be
a
buddy
.
Be
a
buddyroo
.
Okay
?
''
I
did
n't
answer
him
right
away
.
Suspense
is
good
for
some
bastards
like
Stradlater
.
``
What
on
?
''
I
said
.
``
Anything
.
Anything
descriptive
.
A
room
.
Or
a
house
.
Or
something
you
once
lived
in
or
something
--
you
know
.
Just
as
long
as
it
's
descriptive
as
hell
.
''
He
gave
out
a
big
yawn
while
he
said
that
.
Which
is
something
that
gives
me
a
royal
pain
in
the
ass
.
I
mean
if
somebody
yawns
right
while
they
're
asking
you
to
do
them
a
goddam
favor
.
``
Just
do
n't
do
it
too
good
,
is
all
,
''
he
said
.
``
That
sonuvabitch
Hartzell
thinks
you
're
a
hot-shot
in
English
,
and
he
knows
you
're
my
roommate
.
So
I
mean
do
n't
stick
all
the
commas
and
stuff
in
the
right
place
.
''
That
's
something
else
that
gives
me
a
royal
pain
.
I
mean
if
you
're
good
at
writing
compositions
and
somebody
starts
talking
about
commas
.
Stradlater
was
always
doing
that
.
He
wanted
you
to
think
that
the
only
reason
he
was
lousy
at
writing
compositions
was
because
he
stuck
all
the
commas
in
the
wrong
place
.
He
was
a
little
bit
like
Ackley
,
that
way
.
I
once
sat
next
to
Ackley
at
this
basketball
game
.
We
had
a
terrific
guy
on
the
team
,
Howie
Coyle
,
that
could
sink
them
from
the
middle
of
the
floor
,
without
even
touching
the
backboard
or
anything
.
Ackley
kept
saying
,
the
whole
goddam
game
,
that
Coyle
had
a
perfect
build
for
basketball
.
God
,
how
I
hate
that
stuff
.
I
got
bored
sitting
on
that
washbowl
after
a
while
,
so
I
backed
up
a
few
feet
and
started
doing
this
tap
dance
,
just
for
the
hell
of
it
.
I
was
just
amusing
myself
.
I
ca
n't
really
tap-dance
or
anything
,
but
it
was
a
stone
floor
in
the
can
,
and
it
was
good
for
tap-dancing
.
I
started
imitating
one
of
those
guys
in
the
movies
.
In
one
of
those
musicals
.
I
hate
the
movies
like
poison
,
but
I
get
a
bang
imitating
them
.
Old
Stradlater
watched
me
in
the
mirror
while
he
was
shaving
.
All
I
need
's
an
audience
.
I
'm
an
exhibitionist
.
``
I
'm
the
goddarn
Governor
's
son
,
''
I
said
.
I
was
knocking
myself
out
.
Tap-dancing
all
over
the
place
.
``
He
does
n't
want
me
to
be
a
tap
dancer
.
He
wants
me
to
go
to
Oxford
.
But
it
's
in
my
goddam
blood
,
tap-dancing
.
''
Old
Stradlater
laughed
.
He
did
n't
have
too
bad
a
sense
of
humor
.
``
It
's
the
opening
night
of
the
Ziegfeld
Follies
.
''
I
was
getting
out
of
breath
.
I
have
hardly
any
wind
at
all
.
``
The
leading
man
ca
n't
go
on
.
He
's
drunk
as
a
bastard
.
So
who
do
they
get
to
take
his
place
?
Me
,
that
's
who
.
The
little
ole
goddam
Governor
's
son
.
''
``
Where'dja
get
that
hat
?
''
Stradlater
said
.
He
meant
my
hunting
hat
.
He
'd
never
seen
it
before
.
I
was
out
of
breath
anyway
,
so
I
quit
horsing
around
.
I
took
off
my
hat
and
looked
at
it
for
about
the
ninetieth
time
.
``
I
got
it
in
New
York
this
morning
.
For
a
buck
.
Ya
like
it
?
''
Stradlater
nodded
.
``
Sharp
,
''
he
said
.
He
was
only
flattering
me
,
though
,
because
right
away
he
said
,
``
Listen
.
Are
ya
gon
na
write
that
composition
for
me
?
I
have
to
know
.
''
``
If
I
get
the
time
,
I
will
.
If
I
do
n't
,
I
wo
n't
,
''
I
said
.
I
went
over
and
sat
down
at
the
washbowl
next
to
him
again
.
``
Who
's
your
date
?
''
I
asked
him
.
``
Fitzgerald
?
''
``
Hell
,
no
!
I
told
ya
.
I
'm
through
with
that
pig
.
''
``
Yeah
?
Give
her
to
me
,
boy
.
No
kidding
.
She
's
my
type
.
''
``
Take
her
.
.
.
She
's
too
old
for
you
.
''
All
of
a
sudden
--
for
no
good
reason
,
really
,
except
that
I
was
sort
of
in
the
mood
for
horsing
around
--
I
felt
like
jumping
off
the
washbowl
and
getting
old
Stradlater
in
a
half
nelson
.
That
's
a
wrestling
hold
,
in
case
you
do
n't
know
,
where
you
get
the
other
guy
around
the
neck
and
choke
him
to
death
,
if
you
feel
like
it
.
So
I
did
it
.
I
landed
on
him
like
a
goddam
panther
.
``
Cut
it
out
,
Holden
,
for
Chrissake
!
''
Stradlater
said
.
He
did
n't
feel
like
horsing
around
.
He
was
shaving
and
all
.
``
Wuddaya
wan
na
make
me
do
--
cut
my
goddam
head
off
?
''
I
did
n't
let
go
,
though
.
I
had
a
pretty
good
half
nelson
on
him
.
``
Liberate
yourself
from
my
viselike
grip
.
''
I
said
.
``
Je-sus
Christ
.
''
He
put
down
his
razor
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
jerked
his
arms
up
and
sort
of
broke
my
hold
on
him
.
He
was
a
very
strong
guy
.
I
'm
a
very
weak
guy
.
``
Now
,
cut
out
the
crap
,
''
he
said
.
He
started
shaving
himself
all
over
again
.
He
always
shaved
himself
twice
,
to
look
gorgeous
.
With
his
crumby
old
razor
.
``
Who
is
your
date
if
it
is
n't
Fitzgerald
?
''
I
asked
him
.
I
sat
down
on
the
washbowl
next
to
him
again
.
``
That
Phyllis
Smith
babe
?
''
``
No
.
It
was
supposed
to
he
,
but
the
arrangements
got
all
screwed
up
.
I
got
Bud
Thaw
's
girl
's
roommate
now
.
.
.
Hey
.
I
almost
forgot
.
She
knows
you
.
''
``
Who
does
?
''
I
said
.
``
My
date
.
''
``
Yeah
?
''
I
said
.
``
What
's
her
name
?
''
I
was
pretty
interested
.
``
I
'm
thinking
.
.
.
Uh
.
Jean
Gallagher
.
''
Boy
,
I
nearly
dropped
dead
when
he
said
that
.
``
Jane
Gallagher
,
''
I
said
.
I
even
got
up
from
the
washbowl
when
he
said
that
.
I
damn
near
dropped
dead
.
``
You
're
damn
right
I
know
her
.
She
practically
lived
right
next
door
to
me
,
the
summer
before
last
.
She
had
this
big
damn
Doberman
pinscher

That
's
how
I
met
her

dog
used
to
keep
coming
over
in
our

``
You
're
right
in
my
light

Stradlater
said
.
``
Ya
have
to
stand
right
there
?
''
Boy
,
was
I
excited
,
though
.
I
really
was
.
``
Where
is
she
?
''
I
asked
him
.
``
I
oughta
go
down
and
say
hello
to
her

something

Where

she

In

``
Yeah

''
``
How
'd
she
happen
to
mention
me
?
Does
she
go
to
B.M
.
now

She
said
she
might
go
there
.
She
said
she
might
go
to
Shipley
,
too
.
I
thought
she
went
to
Shipley
.
How
'd
she
happen
to
mention
me
?
''
I
was
pretty
excited
.
I
really
was
.
``
I
do
n't
know
,
for
Chrissake
.
Lift
up

willya
?
You
're
on
my
towel

Stradlater
said
.
I
was
sitting
on
his
stupid
towel
.
``
Jane
Gallagher

''
I
said
.
I
could
n't
get
over
it
.
``
Jesus
H
.
Christ

Old
Stradlater
was
putting
Vitalis
on
his
hair
.
My
Vitalis
.
``
She
's
a
dancer
,
''
I
said
.
``
Ballet
and
all

She
used
to
practice
about
two
hours
every
day

right
in
the
middle
of

hottest
weather
and
all
.
She
was
worried
that
it
might
make
her
legs
lousy

all
thick
and
all

I
used

play
checkers
with

just
leave
it
in
the
back
row
.
She
'd
get
them
all
lined
up
in
the
back
row
.
Then
she
'd
never
use
them
.
She
just
liked
the
way
they
looked
when
they
were
all
in
the
back
row
.
''
Stradlater
did
n't
say
anything
.
That
kind
of
stuff
does
n't
interest
most
people
.
``
Her
mother
belonged
to
the
same
club
we
did
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
used
to
caddy
once
in
a
while
,
just
to
make
some
dough
.
I
caddy
'd
for
her
mother
a
couple
of
times
.
She
went
around
in
about
a
hundred
and
seventy
,
for
nine
holes
.
''
Stradlater
was
n't
hardly
listening
.
He
was
combing
his
gorgeous
locks
.
``
I
oughta
go
down
and
at
least
say
hello
to
her
,
''
I
said
.
``
Why
don'tcha
?
''
``
I
will
,
in
a
minute
.
''
He
started
parting
his
hair
all
over
again
.
It
took
him
about
an
hour
to
comb
his
hair
.
``
Her
mother
and
father
were
divorced
.
Her
mother
was
married
again
to
some
booze
hound
,
''
I
said
.
``
Skinny
guy
with
hairy
legs
.
I
remember
him
.
He
wore
shorts
all
the
time
.
Jane
said
he
was
supposed
to
be
a
playwright
or
some
goddam
thing
,
but
all
I
ever
saw
him
do
was
booze
all
the
time
and
listen
to
every
single
goddam
mystery
program
on
the
radio
.
And
run
around
the
goddam
house
,
naked
.
With
Jane
around
,
and
all
.
''
``
Yeah
?
''
Stradlater
said
.
That
really
interested
him
.
About
the
booze
hound
running
around
the
house
naked
,
with
Jane
around
.
Stradlater
was
a
very
sexy
bastard
.
``
She
had
a
lousy
childhood
.
I
'm
not
kidding
.
''
That
did
n't
interest
Stradlater
,
though
.
Only
very
sexy
stuff
interested
him
.
``
Jane
Gallagher
.
Jesus
.
.
.
I
could
n't
get
her
off
my
mind
.
I
really
could
n't
.
``
I
oughta
go
down
and
say
hello
to
her
,
at
least
.
''
``
Why
the
hell
don'tcha
,
instead
of
keep
saying
it
?
''
Stradlater
said
.
I
walked
over
to
the
window
,
but
you
could
n't
see
out
of
it
,
it
was
so
steamy
from
all
the
heat
in
the
can..
``
I
'm
not
in
the
mood
right
now
,
''
I
said
.
I
was
n't
,
either
.
You
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
those
things
.
``
I
thought
she
went
to
Shipley
.
I
could
've
sworn
she
went
to
Shipley
.
''
I
walked
around
the
can
for
a
little
while
.
I
did
n't
have
anything
else
to
do
.
``
Did
she
enjoy
the
game
?
''
I
said
.
``
Yeah
,
I
guess
so
.
I
do
n't
know
.
''
``
Did
she
tell
you
we
used
to
play
checkers
all
the
time
,
or
anything
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
.
For
Chrissake
,
I
only
just
met
her
,
''
Stradlater
said
.
He
was
finished
combing
his
goddam
gorgeous
hair
.
He
was
putting
away
all
his
crumby
toilet
articles
.
``
Listen
.
Give
her
my
regards
,
willya
?
''
``
Okay
,
''
Stradlater
said
,
but
I
knew
he
probably
would
n't
.
You
take
a
guy
like
Stradlater
,
they
never
give
your
regards
to
people
.
He
went
back
to
the
room
,
but
I
stuck
around
in
the
can
for
a
while
,
thinking
about
old
Jane
.
Then
I
went
back
to
the
room
,
too
.
Stradlater
was
putting
on
his
tie
,
in
front
of
the
mirror
,
when
I
got
there
.
He
spent
around
half
his
goddam
life
in
front
of
the
mirror
.
I
sat
down
in
my
chair
and
sort
of
watched
him
for
a
while
.
``
Hey
,
''
I
said
.
``
Do
n't
tell
her
I
got
kicked
out
,
willya
?
''
``
Okay
.
''
That
was
one
good
thing
about
Stradlater
.
You
did
n't
have
to
explain
every
goddam
little
thing
with
him
,
the
way
you
had
to
do
with
Ackley
.
Mostly
,
I
guess
,
because
he
was
n't
too
interested
.
That
's
really
why
.
Ackley
,
it
was
different
.
Ackley
was
a
very
nosy
bastard
.
He
put
on
my
hound's-tooth
jacket
.
``
Jesus
,
now
,
try
not
to
stretch
it
all
over
the
place
''
I
said
.
I
'd
only
worn
it
about
twice
.
``
I
wo
n't
.
Where
the
hell
's
my
cigarettes
?
''
``
On
the
desk
.
''
He
never
knew
where
he
left
anything
.
``
Under
your
muffler
.
''
He
put
them
in
his
coat
pocket
--
my
coat
pocket
.
I
pulled
the
peak
of
my
hunting
hat
around
to
the
front
all
of
a
sudden
,
for
a
change
.
I
was
getting
sort
of
nervous
,
all
of
a
sudden
.
I
'm
quite
a
nervous
guy
.
``
Listen
,
where
ya
going
on
your
date
with
her
?
''
I
asked
him
.
``
Ya
know
yet
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
.
New
York
,
if
we
have
time
.
She
only
signed
out
for
nine-thirty
,
for
Chrissake
.
''
I
did
n't
like
the
way
he
said
it
,
so
I
said
,
``
The
reason
she
did
that
,
she
probably
just
did
n't
know
what
a
handsome
,
charming
bastard
you
are
.
If
she
'd
known
,
she
probably
would
've
signed
out
for
nine-thirty
in
the
morning
.
''
``
Goddam
right
,
''
Stradlater
said
.
You
could
n't
rile
him
too
easily
.
He
was
too
conceited
.
``
No
kidding
,
now
.
Do
that
composition
for
me
,
''
he
said
.
He
had
his
coat
on
,
and
he
was
all
ready
to
go
.
``
Do
n't
knock
yourself
out
or
anything
,
but
just
make
it
descriptive
as
hell
.
Okay
?
''
I
did
n't
answer
him
.
I
did
n't
feel
like
it
.
All
I
said
was
,
``
Ask
her
if
she
still
keeps
all
her
kings
in
the
back
row
.
''
``
Okay
,
''
Stradlater
said
,
but
I
knew
he
would
n't
.
``
Take
it
easy
,
now
.
''
He
banged
the
hell
out
of
the
room
.
I
sat
there
for
about
a
half
hour
after
he
left
.
I
mean
I
just
sat
in
my
chair
,
not
doing
anything
.
I
kept
thinking
about
Jane
,
and
about
Stradlater
having
a
date
with
her
and
all
.
It
made
me
so
nervous
I
nearly
went
crazy
.
I
already
told
you
what
a
sexy
bastard
Stradlater
was
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
Ackley
barged
back
in
again
,
through
the
damn
shower
curtains
,
as
usual
.
For
once
in
my
stupid
life
,
I
was
really
glad
to
see
him
.
He
took
my
mind
off
the
other
stuff
.
He
stuck
around
till
around
dinnertime
,
talking
about
all
the
guys
at
Pencey
that
he
hated
their
guts
,
and
squeezing
this
big
pimple
on
his
chin
.
He
did
n't
even
use
his
handkerchief
.
I
do
n't
even
think
the
bastard
had
a
handkerchief
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
I
never
saw
him
use
one
,
anyway
.
5
We
always
had
the
same
meal
on
Saturday
nights
at
Pencey
.
It
was
supposed
to
be
a
big
deal
,
because
they
gave
you
steak
.
I
'll
bet
a
thousand
bucks
the
reason
they
did
that
was
because
a
lot
of
guys
'
parents
came
up
to
school
on
Sunday
,
and
old
Thurmer
probably
figured
everybody
's
mother
would
ask
their
darling
boy
what
he
had
for
dinner
last
night
,
and
he
'd
say
,
``
Steak
.
''
What
a
racket
.
You
should
've
seen
the
steaks
.
They
were
these
little
hard
,
dry
jobs
that
you
could
hardly
even
cut
.
You
always
got
these
very
lumpy
mashed
potatoes
on
steak
night
,
and
for
dessert
you
got
Brown
Betty
,
which
nobody
ate
,
except
maybe
the
little
kids
in
the
lower
school
that
did
n't
know
any
better
--
and
guys
like
Ackley
that
ate
everything
.
It
was
nice
,
though
,
when
we
got
out
of
the
dining
room
.
There
were
about
three
inches
of
snow
on
the
ground
,
and
it
was
still
coming
down
like
a
madman
.
It
looked
pretty
as
hell
,
and
we
all
started
throwing
snowballs
and
horsing
around
all
over
the
place
.
It
was
very
childish
,
but
everybody
was
really
enjoying
themselves
.
I
did
n't
have
a
date
or
anything
,
so
I
and
this
friend
of
mine
,
Mal
Brossard
,
that
was
on
the
wrestling
team
,
decided
we
'd
take
a
bus
into
Agerstown
and
have
a
hamburger
and
maybe
see
a
lousy
movie
.
Neither
of
us
felt
like
sitting
around
on
our
ass
all
night
.
I
asked
Mal
if
he
minded
if
Ackley
came
along
with
us
.
The
reason
I
asked
was
because
Ackley
never
did
anything
on
Saturday
night
,
except
stay
in
his
room
and
squeeze
his
pimples
or
something
.
Mal
said
he
did
n't
mind
but
that
he
was
n't
too
crazy
about
the
idea
.
He
did
n't
like
Ackley
much
.
Anyway
,
we
both
went
to
our
rooms
to
get
ready
and
all
,
and
while
I
was
putting
on
my
galoshes
and
crap
,
I
yelled
over
and
asked
old
Ackley
if
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
movies
.
He
could
hear
me
all
right
through
the
shower
curtains
,
but
he
did
n't
answer
me
right
away
.
He
was
the
kind
of
a
guy
that
hates
to
answer
you
right
away
.
Finally
he
came
over
,
through
the
goddam
curtains
,
and
stood
on
the
shower
ledge
and
asked
who
was
going
besides
me
.
He
always
had
to
know
who
was
going
.
I
swear
,
if
that
guy
was
shipwrecked
somewhere
,
and
you
rescued
him
in
a
goddam
boat
,
he
'd
want
to
know
who
the
guy
was
that
was
rowing
it
before
he
'd
even
get
in
.
I
told
him
Mal
Brossard
was
going
.
He
said
,
``
That
bastard
.
.
.
All
right
.
Wait
a
second
.
''
You
'd
think
he
was
doing
you
a
big
favor
.
It
took
him
about
five
hours
to
get
ready
.
While
he
was
doing
it
,
I
went
over
to
my
window
and
opened
it
and
packed
a
snowball
with
my
bare
hands
.
The
snow
was
very
good
for
packing
.
I
did
n't
throw
it
at
anything
,
though
.
I
started
to
throw
it
.
At
a
car
that
was
parked
across
the
street
.
But
I
changed
my
mind
.
The
car
looked
so
nice
and
white
.
Then
I
started
to
throw
it
at
a
hydrant
,
but
that
looked
too
nice
and
white
,
too
.
Finally
I
did
n't
throw
it
at
anything
.
All
I
did
was
close
the
window
and
walk
around
the
room
with
the
snowball
,
packing
it
harder
.
A
little
while
later
,
I
still
had
it
with
me
when
I
and
Brossnad
and
Ackley
got
on
the
bus
.
The
bus
driver
opened
the
doors
and
made
me
throw
it
out
.
I
told
him
I
was
n't
going
to
chuck
it
at
anybody
,
but
he
would
n't
believe
me
.
People
never
believe
you
.
Brossard
and
Ackley
both
had
seen
the
picture
that
was
playing
,
so
all
we
did
,
we
just
had
a
couple
of
hamburgers
and
played
the
pinball
machine
for
a
little
while
,
then
took
the
bus
back
to
Pencey
.
I
did
n't
care
about
not
seeing
the
movie
,
anyway
.
It
was
supposed
to
be
a
comedy
,
with
Cary
Grant
in
it
,
and
all
that
crap
.
Besides
,
I
'd
been
to
the
movies
with
Brossard
and
Ackley
before
.
They
both
laughed
like
hyenas
at
stuff
that
was
n't
even
funny
.
I
did
n't
even
enjoy
sitting
next
to
them
in
the
movies
.
It
was
only
about
a
quarter
to
nine
when
we
got
back
to
the
dorm
.
Old
Brossard
was
a
bridge
fiend
,
and
he
started
looking
around
the
dorm
for
a
game
.
Old
Ackley
parked
himself
in
my
room
,
just
for
a
change
.
Only
,
instead
of
sitting
on
the
arm
of
Stradlater
's
chair
,
he
laid
down
on
my
bed
,
with
his
face
right
on
my
pillow
and
all
.
He
started
talking
in
this
very
monotonous
voice
,
and
picking
at
all
his
pimples
.
I
dropped
about
a
thousand
hints
,
but
I
could
n't
get
rid
of
him
.
All
he
did
was
keep
talking
in
this
very
monotonous
voice
about
some
babe
he
was
supposed
to
have
had
sexual
intercourse
with
the
summer
before
.
He
'd
already
told
me
about
it
about
a
hundred
times
.
Every
time
he
told
it
,
it
was
different
.
One
minute
he
'd
be
giving
it
to
her
in
his
cousin
's
Buick
,
the
next
minute
he
'd
be
giving
it
to
her
under
some
boardwalk
.
It
was
all
a
lot
of
crap
,
naturally
.
He
was
a
virgin
if
ever
I
saw
one
.
I
doubt
if
he
ever
even
gave
anybody
a
feel
.
Anyway
,
finally
I
had
to
come
right
out
and
tell
him
that
I
had
to
write
a
composition
for
Stradlater
,
and
that
he
had
to
clear
the
hell
out
,
so
I
could
concentrate
.
He
finally
did
,
but
he
took
his
time
about
it
,
as
usual
.
After
he
left
,
I
put
on
my
pajamas
and
bathrobe
and
my
old
hunting
hat
,
and
started
writing
the
composition
.
The
thing
was
,
I
could
n't
think
of
a
room
or
a
house
or
anything
to
describe
the
way
Stradlater
said
he
had
to
have
.
I
'm
not
too
crazy
about
describing
rooms
and
houses
anyway
.
So
what
I
did
,
I
wrote
about
my
brother
Allie
's
baseball
mitt
.
It
was
a
very
descriptive
subject
.
It
really
was
.
My
brother
Allie
had
this
left-handed
fielder
's
mitt
.
He
was
left-handed
.
The
thing
that
was
descriptive
about
it
,
though
,
was
that
he
had
poems
written
all
over
the
fingers
and
the
pocket
and
everywhere
.
In
green
ink
.
He
wrote
them
on
it
so
that
he
'd
have
something
to
read
when
he
was
in
the
field
and
nobody
was
up
at
bat
.
He
's
dead
now
.
He
got
leukemia
and
died
when
we
were
up
in
Maine
,
on
July
18
,
1946
.
You
'd
have
liked
him
.
He
was
two
years
younger
than
I
was
,
but
he
was
about
fifty
times
as
intelligent
.
He
was
terrifically
intelligent
.
His
teachers
were
always
writing
letters
to
my
mother
,
telling
her
what
a
pleasure
it
was
having
a
boy
like
Allie
in
their
class
.
And
they
were
n't
just
shooting
the
crap
.
They
really
meant
it
.
But
it
was
n't
just
that
he
was
the
most
intelligent
member
in
the
family
.
He
was
also
the
nicest
,
in
lots
of
ways
.
He
never
got
mad
at
anybody
.
People
with
red
hair
are
supposed
to
get
mad
very
easily
,
but
Allie
never
did
,
and
he
had
very
red
hair
.
I
'll
tell
you
what
kind
of
red
hair
he
had
.
I
started
playing
golf
when
I
was
only
ten
years
old
.
I
remember
once
,
the
summer
I
was
around
twelve
,
teeing
off
and
all
,
and
having
a
hunch
that
if
I
turned
around
all
of
a
sudden
,
I
'd
see
Allie
.
So
I
did
,
and
sure
enough
,
he
was
sitting
on
his
bike
outside
the
fence
--
there
was
this
fence
that
went
all
around
the
course
--
and
he
was
sitting
there
,
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
behind
me
,
watching
me
tee
off
.
That
's
the
kind
of
red
hair
he
had
.
God
,
he
was
a
nice
kid
,
though
.
He
used
to
laugh
so
hard
at
something
he
thought
of
at
the
dinner
table
that
he
just
about
fell
off
his
chair
.
I
was
only
thirteen
,
and
they
were
going
to
have
me
psychoanalyzed
and
all
,
because
I
broke
all
the
windows
in
the
garage
.
I
do
n't
blame
them
.
I
really
do
n't
.
I
slept
in
the
garage
the
night
he
died
,
and
I
broke
all
the
goddam
windows
with
my
fist
,
just
for
the
hell
of
it
.
I
even
tried
to
break
all
the
windows
on
the
station
wagon
we
had
that
summer
,
but
my
hand
was
already
broken
and
everything
by
that
time
,
and
I
could
n't
do
it
.
It
was
a
very
stupid
thing
to
do
,
I
'll
admit
,
but
I
hardly
did
n't
even
know
I
was
doing
it
,
and
you
did
n't
know
Allie
.
My
hand
still
hurts
me
once
in
a
while
when
it
rains
and
all
,
and
I
ca
n't
make
a
real
fist
any
more
--
not
a
tight
one
,
I
mean
--
but
outside
of
that
I
do
n't
care
much
.
I
mean
I
'm
not
going
to
be
a
goddam
surgeon
or
a
violinist
or
anything
anyway
.
Anyway
,
that
's
what
I
wrote
Stradlater
's
composition
about
.
Old
Allie
's
baseball
mitt
.
I
happened
to
have
it
with
me
,
in
my
suitcase
,
so
I
got
it
out
and
copied
down
the
poems
that
were
written
on
it
.
All
I
had
to
do
was
change
Allie
's
name
so
that
nobody
would
know
it
was
my
brother
and
not
Stradlater
's
.
I
was
n't
too
crazy
about
doing
it
,
but
I
could
n't
think
of
anything
else
descriptive
.
Besides
,
I
sort
of
liked
writing
about
it
.
It
took
me
about
an
hour
,
because
I
had
to
use
Stradlater
's
lousy
typewriter
,
and
it
kept
jamming
on
me
.
The
reason
I
did
n't
use
my
own
was
because
I
'd
lent
it
to
a
guy
down
the
hall
.
It
was
around
ten-thirty
,
I
guess
,
when
I
finished
it
.
I
was
n't
tired
,
though
,
so
I
looked
out
the
window
for
a
while
.
It
was
n't
snowing
out
any
more
,
but
every
once
in
a
while
you
could
hear
a
car
somewhere
not
being
able
to
get
started
.
You
could
also
hear
old
Ackley
snoring
.
Right
through
the
goddam
shower
curtains
you
could
hear
him
.
He
had
sinus
trouble
and
he
could
n't
breathe
too
hot
when
he
was
asleep
.
That
guy
had
just
about
everything
.
Sinus
trouble
,
pimples
,
lousy
teeth
,
halitosis
,
crumby
fingernails
.
You
had
to
feel
a
little
sorry
for
the
crazy
sonuvabitch
.

Some
things
are
hard
to
remember
.
I
'm
thinking
now
of
when
Stradlater
got
back
from
his
date
with
Jane
.
I
mean
I
ca
n't
remember
exactly
what
I
was
doing
when
I
heard
his
goddam
stupid
footsteps
coming
down
the
corridor
.
I
probably
was
still
looking
out
the
window
,
but
I
swear
I
ca
n't
remember
.
I
was
so
damn
worried
,
that
's
why
.
When
I
really
worry
about
something
,
I
do
n't
just
fool
around
.
I
even
have
to
go
to
the
bathroom
when
I
worry
about
something
.
Only
,
I
do
n't
go
.
I
'm
too
worried
to
go
.
I
do
n't
want
to
interrupt
my
worrying
to
go
.
If
you
knew
Stradlater
,
you
'd
have
been
worried
,
too
.
I
'd
double-dated
with
that
bastard
a
couple
of
times
,
and
I
know
what
I
'm
talking
about
.
He
was
unscrupulous
.
He
really
was
.
Anyway
,
the
corridor
was
all
linoleum
and
all
,
and
you
could
hear
his
goddam
footsteps
coming
right
towards
the
room
.
I
do
n't
even
remember
where
I
was
sitting
when
he
came
in
--
at
the
window
,
or
in
my
chair
or
his
.
I
swear
I
ca
n't
remember
.
He
came
in
griping
about
how
cold
it
was
out
.
Then
he
said
,
``
Where
the
hell
is
everybody
?
It
's
like
a
goddam
morgue
around
here
.
''
I
did
n't
even
bother
to
answer
him
.
If
he
was
so
goddam
stupid
not
to
realize
it
was
Saturday
night
and
everybody
was
out
or
asleep
or
home
for
the
week
end
,
I
was
n't
going
to
break
my
neck
telling
him
.
He
started
getting
undressed
.
He
did
n't
say
one
goddam
word
about
Jane
.
Not
one
.
Neither
did
I.
I
just
watched
him
.
All
he
did
was
thank
me
for
letting
him
wear
my
hound's-tooth
.
He
hung
it
up
on
a
hanger
and
put
it
in
the
closet
.
Then
when
he
was
taking
off
his
tie
,
he
asked
me
if
I
'd
written
his
goddam
composition
for
him
.
I
told
him
it
was
over
on
his
goddam
bed
.
He
walked
over
and
read
it
while
he
was
unbuttoning
his
shirt
.
He
stood
there
,
reading
it
,
and
sort
of
stroking
his
bare
chest
and
stomach
,
with
this
very
stupid
expression
on
his
face
.
He
was
always
stroking
his
stomach
or
his
chest
.
He
was
mad
about
himself
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
he
said
,
``
For
Chrissake
,
Holden
.
This
is
about
a
goddam
baseball
glove
.
''
``
So
what
?
''
I
said
.
Cold
as
hell
.
``
Wuddaya
mean
so
what
?
I
told
ya
it
had
to
be
about
a
goddam
room
or
a
house
or
something
.
''
``
You
said
it
had
to
be
descriptive
.
What
the
hell
's
the
difference
if
it
's
about
a
baseball
glove
?
''
``
God
damn
it
.
''
He
was
sore
as
hell
.
He
was
really
furious
.
``
You
always
do
everything
backasswards
.
''
He
looked
at
me
.
``
No
wonder
you
're
flunking
the
hell
out
of
here
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
do
n't
do
one
damn
thing
the
way
you
're
supposed
to
.
I
mean
it
.
Not
one
damn
thing
.
''
``
All
right
,
give
it
back
to
me
,
then
,
''
I
said
.
I
went
over
and
pulled
it
right
out
of
his
goddam
hand
.
Then
I
tore
it
up
.
``
What
the
hellja
do
that
for
?
''
he
said
.
I
did
n't
even
answer
him
.
I
just
threw
the
pieces
in
the
wastebasket
.
Then
I
lay
down
on
my
bed
,
and
we
both
did
n't
say
anything
for
a
long
time
.
He
got
all
undressed
,
down
to
his
shorts
,
and
I
lay
on
my
bed
and
lit
a
cigarette
.
You
were
n't
allowed
to
smoke
in
the
dorm
,
but
you
could
do
it
late
at
night
when
everybody
was
asleep
or
out
and
nobody
could
smell
the
smoke
.
Besides
,
I
did
it
to
annoy
Stradlater
.
It
drove
him
crazy
when
you
broke
any
rules
.
He
never
smoked
in
the
dorm
.
It
was
only
me
.
He
still
did
n't
say
one
single
solitary
word
about
Jane
.
So
finally
I
said
,
``
You
're
back
pretty
goddam
late
if
she
only
signed
out
for
nine-thirty
.
Did
you
make
her
be
late
signing
in
?
''
He
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
,
cutting
his
goddam
toenails
,
when
I
asked
him
that
.
``
Coupla
minutes
,
''
he
said
.
``
Who
the
hell
signs
out
for
nine-thirty
on
a
Saturday
night
?
''
God
,
how
I
hated
him
.
``
Did
you
go
to
New
York
?
''
I
said
.
``
Ya
crazy
?
How
the
hell
could
we
go
to
New
York
if
she
only
signed
out
for
nine-thirty
?
''
``
That
's
tough
.
''
He
looked
up
at
me
.
``
Listen
,
''
he
said
,
``
if
you
're
gon
na
smoke
in
the
room
,
how
'bout
going
down
to
the
can
and
do
it
?
You
may
be
getting
the
hell
out
of
here
,
but
I
have
to
stick
around
long
enough
to
graduate
.
''
I
ignored
him
.
I
really
did
.
I
went
right
on
smoking
like
a
madman
.
All
I
did
was
sort
of
turn
over
on
my
side
and
watched
him
cut
his
damn
toenails
.
What
a
school
.
You
were
always
watching
somebody
cut
their
damn
toenails
or
squeeze
their
pimples
or
something
.
``
Did
you
give
her
my
regards
?
''
I
asked
him
.
``
Yeah
.
''
The
hell
he
did
,
the
bastard
.
``
What
'd
she
say
?
''
I
said
.
``
Did
you
ask
her
if
she
still
keeps
all
her
kings
in
the
back
row
?
''
``
No
,
I
did
n't
ask
her
.
What
the
hell
ya
think
we
did
all
night
--
play
checkers
,
for
Chrissake
?
''
I
did
n't
even
answer
him
.
God
,
how
I
hated
him
.
``
If
you
did
n't
go
to
New
York
,
where
'd
ya
go
with
her
?
''
I
asked
him
,
after
a
little
while
.
I
could
hardly
keep
my
voice
from
shaking
all
over
the
place
.
Boy
,
was
I
getting
nervous
.
I
just
had
a
feeling
something
had
gone
funny
.
He
was
finished
cutting
his
damn
toenails
.
So
he
got
up
from
the
bed
,
in
just
his
damn
shorts
and
all
,
and
started
getting
very
damn
playful
.
He
came
over
to
my
bed
and
started
leaning
over
me
and
taking
these
playful
as
hell
socks
at
my
shoulder
.
``
Cut
it
out
,
''
I
said
.
``
Where
'd
you
go
with
her
if
you
did
n't
go
to
New
York
?
''
``
Nowhere
.
We
just
sat
in
the
goddam
car
.
''
He
gave
me
another
one
of
those
playtul
stupid
little
socks
on
the
shoulder
.
``
Cut
it
out
,
''
I
said
.
``
Whose
car
?
''
``
Ed
Banky
's
.
''
Ed
Banky
was
the
basketball
coach
at
Pencey
.
Old
Stradlater
was
one
of
his
pets
,
because
he
was
the
center
on
the
team
,
and
Ed
Banky
always
let
him
borrow
his
car
when
he
wanted
it
.
It
was
n't
allowed
for
students
to
borrow
faculty
guys
'
cars
,
but
all
the
athletic
bastards
stuck
together
.
In
every
school
I
've
gone
to
,
all
the
athletic
bastards
stick
together
.
Stradlater
kept
taking
these
shadow
punches
down
at
my
shoulder
.
He
had
his
toothbrush
in
his
hand
,
and
he
put
it
in
his
mouth
.
``
What
'd
you
do
?
''
I
said
.
``
Give
her
the
time
in
Ed
Banky
's
goddam
car
?
''
My
voice
was
shaking
something
awful
.
``
What
a
thing
to
say
.
Want
me
to
wash
your
mouth
out
with
soap
?
''
``
Did
you
?
''
``
That
's
a
professional
secret
,
buddy
.
''
This
next
part
I
do
n't
remember
so
hot
.
All
I
know
is
I
got
up
from
the
bed
,
like
I
was
going
down
to
the
can
or
something
,
and
then
I
tried
to
sock
him
,
with
all
my
might
,
right
smack
in
the
toothbrush
,
so
it
would
split
his
goddam
throat
open
.
Only
,
I
missed
.
I
did
n't
connect
.
All
I
did
was
sort
of
get
him
on
the
side
of
the
head
or
something
.
It
probably
hurt
him
a
little
bit
,
but
not
as
much
as
I
wanted
.
It
probably
would
've
hurt
him
a
lot
,
but
I
did
it
with
my
right
hand
,
and
I
ca
n't
make
a
good
fist
with
that
hand
.
On
account
of
that
injury
I
told
you
about
.
Anyway
,
the
next
thing
I
knew
,
I
was
on
the
goddam
floor
and
he
was
sitting
on
my
chest
,
with
his
face
all
red
.
That
is
,
he
had
his
goddam
knees
on
my
chest
,
and
he
weighed
about
a
ton
.
He
had
hold
of
my
wrists
,
too
,
so
I
could
n't
take
another
sock
at
him
.
I'd
've
killed
him
.
``
What
the
hell
's
the
matter
with
you
?
''
he
kept
saying
,
and
his
stupid
race
kept
getting
redder
and
redder
.
``
Get
your
lousy
knees
off
my
chest
,
''
I
told
him
.
I
was
almost
bawling
.
I
really
was
.
``
Go
on
,
get
off
a
me
,
ya
crumby
bastard
.
''
He
would
n't
do
it
,
though
.
He
kept
holding
onto
my
wrists
and
I
kept
calling
him
a
sonuvabitch
and
all
,
for
around
ten
hours
.
I
can
hardly
even
remember
what
all
I
said
to
him
.
I
told
him
he
thought
he
could
give
the
time
to
anybody
he
felt
like
.
I
told
him
he
did
n't
even
care
if
a
girl
kept
all
her
kings
in
the
back
row
or
not
,
and
the
reason
he
did
n't
care
was
because
he
was
a
goddam
stupid
moron
.
He
hated
it
when
you
called
a
moron
.
All
morons
hate
it
when
you
call
them
a
moron
.
``
Shut
up
,
now
,
Holden
,
''
he
said
with
his
big
stupid
red
face
.
``
just
shut
up
,
now
.
''
``
You
do
n't
even
know
if
her
first
name
is
Jane
or
Jean
,
ya
goddam
moron
!
''
``
Now
,
shut
up
,
Holden
,
God
damn
it
--
I
'm
warning
ya
,
''
he
said
--
I
really
had
him
going
.
``
If
you
do
n't
shut
up
,
I
'm
gon
na
slam
ya
one
.
''
``
Get
your
dirty
stinking
moron
knees
off
my
chest
.
''
``
If
I
letcha
up
,
will
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
?
''
I
did
n't
even
answer
him
.
He
said
it
over
again
.
``
Holden
.
If
I
letcha
up
,
willya
keep
your
mouth
shut
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
He
got
up
off
me
,
and
I
got
up
,
too
.
My
chest
hurt
like
hell
from
his
dirty
knees
.
``
You
're
a
dirty
stupid
sonuvabitch
of
a
moron
,
''
I
told
him
.
That
got
him
really
mad
.
He
shook
his
big
stupid
finger
in
my
face
.
``
Holden
,
God
damn
it
,
I
'm
warning
you
,
now
.
For
the
last
time
.
If
you
do
n't
keep
your
yap
shut
,
I
'm
gon
na
--
''
``
Why
should
I
?
''
I
said
--
I
was
practically
yelling
.
``
That
's
just
the
trouble
with
all
you
morons
.
You
never
want
to
discuss
anything
.
That
's
the
way
you
can
always
tell
a
moron
.
They
never
want
to
discuss
anything
intellig
--
''
Then
he
really
let
one
go
at
me
,
and
the
next
thing
I
knew
I
was
on
the
goddam
floor
again
.
I
do
n't
remember
if
he
knocked
me
out
or
not
,
but
I
do
n't
think
so
.
It
's
pretty
hard
to
knock
a
guy
out
,
except
in
the
goddam
movies
.
But
my
nose
was
bleeding
all
over
the
place
.
When
I
looked
up
old
Stradlater
was
standing
practically
right
on
top
of
me
.
He
had
his
goddam
toilet
kit
under
his
arm
.
``
Why
the
hell
don'tcha
shut
up
when
I
tellya
to
?
''
he
said
.
He
sounded
pretty
nervous
.
He
probably
was
scared
he
'd
fractured
my
skull
or
something
when
I
hit
the
floor
.
It
's
too
bad
I
did
n't
.
``
You
asked
for
it
,
God
damn
it
,
''
he
said
.
Boy
,
did
he
look
worried
.
I
did
n't
even
bother
to
get
up
.
I
just
lay
there
in
the
floor
for
a
while
,
and
kept
calling
him
a
moron
sonuvabitch
.
I
was
so
mad
,
I
was
practically
bawling
.
``
Listen
.
Go
wash
your
face
,
''
Stradlater
said
.
``
Ya
hear
me
?
''
I
told
him
to
go
wash
his
own
moron
face
--
which
was
a
pretty
childish
thing
to
say
,
but
I
was
mad
as
hell
.
I
told
him
to
stop
off
on
the
way
to
the
can
and
give
Mrs.
Schmidt
the
time
.
Mrs.
Schmidt
was
the
janitor
's
wife
.
She
was
around
sixty-five
.
I
kept
sitting
there
on
the
floor
till
I
heard
old
Stradlater
close
the
door
and
go
down
the
corridor
to
the
can
.
Then
I
got
up
.
I
could
n't
find
my
goddam
hunting
hat
anywhere
.
Finally
I
found
it
.
It
was
under
the
bed
.
I
put
it
on
,
and
turned
the
old
peak
around
to
the
back
,
the
way
I
liked
it
,
and
then
I
went
over
and
took
a
look
at
my
stupid
face
in
the
mirror
.
You
never
saw
such
gore
in
your
life
.
I
had
blood
all
over
my
mouth
and
chin
and
even
on
my
pajamas
and
bath
robe
.
It
partly
scared
me
and
it
partly
fascinated
me
.
All
that
blood
and
all
sort
of
made
me
look
tough
.
I
'd
only
been
in
about
two
fights
in
my
life
,
and
I
lost
both
of
them
.
I
'm
not
too
tough
.
I
'm
a
pacifist
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
I
had
a
feeling
old
Ackley
'd
probably
heard
all
the
racket
and
was
awake
.
So
I
went
through
the
shower
curtains
into
his
room
,
just
to
see
what
the
hell
he
was
doing
.
I
hardly
ever
went
over
to
his
room
.
It
always
had
a
funny
stink
in
it
,
because
he
was
so
crumby
in
his
personal
habits
.
7
A
tiny
bit
of
light
came
through
the
shower
curtains
and
all
from
our
room
,
and
I
could
see
him
lying
in
bed
.
I
knew
damn
well
he
was
wide
awake
.
``
Ackley
?
''
I
said
.
``
Y'awake
?
''
``
Yeah
.
''
It
was
pretty
dark
,
and
I
stepped
on
somebody
's
shoe
on
the
floor
and
danm
near
fell
on
my
head
.
Ackley
sort
of
sat
up
in
bed
and
leaned
on
his
arm
.
He
had
a
lot
of
white
stuff
on
his
face
,
for
his
pimples
.
He
looked
sort
of
spooky
in
the
dark
.
``
What
the
hellya
doing
,
anyway
?
''
I
said
.
``
Wuddaya
mean
what
the
hell
am
I
doing
?
I
was
tryna
sleep
before
you
guys
started
making
all
that
noise
.
What
the
hell
was
the
fight
about
,
anyhow
?
''
``
Where
's
the
light
?
''
I
could
n't
find
the
light
.
I
was
sliding
my
hand
all
over
the
wall
.
``
Wuddaya
want
the
light
for
?
.
.
.
Right
next
to
your
hand
.
''
I
finally
found
the
switch
and
turned
It
on
.
Old
Ackley
put
his
hand
up
so
the
light
would
n't
hurt
his
eyes
.
``
Jesus
!
''
he
said
.
``
What
the
hell
happened
to
you
?
''
He
meant
all
the
blood
and
all
.
``
I
had
a
little
goddam
tiff
with
Stradlater
,
''
I
said
.
Then
I
sat
down
on
the
floor
.
They
never
had
any
chairs
in
their
room
.
I
do
n't
know
what
the
hell
they
did
with
their
chairs
.
``
Listen
,
''
I
said
,
``
do
you
feel
like
playing
a
little
Canasta
?
''
He
was
a
Canasta
fiend
.
``
You
're
still
bleeding
,
for
Chrissake
.
You
better
put
something
on
it
.
''
``
It
'll
stop
.
Listen
.
Ya
wan
na
play
a
little
Canasta
or
don'tcha
?
''
``
Canasta
,
for
Chrissake
.
Do
you
know
what
time
it
is
,
by
any
chance
?
''
``
It
is
n't
late
.
It
's
only
around
eleven
,
eleven-thirty
.
''
``
Only
around
!
''
Ackley
said
.
``
Listen
.
I
got
ta
get
up
and
go
to
Mass
in
the
morning
,
for
Chrissake
.
You
guys
start
hollering
and
fighting
in
the
middle
of
the
goddam
--
What
the
hell
was
the
fight
about
,
anyhow
?
''
``
It
's
a
long
story
.
I
do
n't
wan
na
bore
ya
,
Ackley
.
I
'm
thinking
of
your
welfare
,
''
I
told
him
.
I
never
discussed
my
personal
life
with
him
.
In
the
first
place
,
he
was
even
more
stupid
than
Stradlater
.
Stradlater
was
a
goddam
genius
next
to
Ackley
.
``
Hey
,
''
I
said
,
``
is
it
okay
if
I
sleep
in
Ely
's
bed
tonight
?
He
wo
n't
be
back
till
tomorrow
night
,
will
he
?
''
I
knew
damn
well
he
would
n't
.
Ely
went
home
damn
near
every
week
end
.
``
I
do
n't
know
when
the
hell
he
's
coming
back
,
''
Ackley
said
.
Boy
,
did
that
annoy
me
.
``
What
the
hell
do
you
mean
you
do
n't
know
when
he
's
coming
back
?
He
never
comes
back
till
Sunday
night
,
does
he
?
''
``
No
,
but
for
Chrissake
,
I
ca
n't
just
tell
somebody
they
can
sleep
in
his
goddam
bed
if
they
want
to
.
''
That
killed
me
.
I
reached
up
from
where
I
was
sitting
on
the
floor
and
patted
him
on
the
goddam
shoulder
.
``
You
're
a
prince
,
Ackley
kid
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
know
that
?
''
``
No
,
I
mean
it
--
I
ca
n't
just
tell
somebody
they
can
sleep
in
--
''
``
You
're
a
real
prince
.
You
're
a
gentleman
and
a
scholar
,
kid
,
''
I
said
.
He
really
was
,
too
.
``
Do
you
happen
to
have
any
cigarettes
,
by
any
chance
?
--
Say
'no
'
or
I
'll
drop
dead
.
''
``
No
,
I
do
n't
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
.
Listen
,
what
the
hell
was
the
fight
about
?
''
I
did
n't
answer
him
.
All
I
did
was
,
I
got
up
and
went
over
and
looked
out
the
window
.
I
felt
so
lonesome
,
all
of
a
sudden
.
I
almost
wished
I
was
dead
.
``
What
the
hell
was
the
fight
about
,
anyhow
?
''
Ackley
said
,
for
about
the
fiftieth
time
.
He
certainly
was
a
bore
about
that
.
``
About
you
,
''
I
said
.
``
About
me
,
for
Chrissake
?
''
``
Yeah
.
I
was
defending
your
goddam
honor
.
Stradlater
said
you
had
a
lousy
personality
.
I
could
n't
let
him
get
away
with
that
stuff
.
''
That
got
him
excited
.
``
He
did
?
No
kidding
?
He
did
?
''
I
told
him
I
was
only
kidding
,
and
then
I
went
over
and
laid
down
on
Ely
's
bed
.
Boy
,
did
I
feel
rotten
.
I
felt
so
damn
lonesome
.
``
This
room
stinks
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
can
smell
your
socks
from
way
over
here
.
Don'tcha
ever
send
them
to
the
laundry
?
''
``
If
you
do
n't
like
it
,
you
know
what
you
can
do
,
''
Ackley
said
.
What
a
witty
guy
.
``
How
'bout
turning
off
the
goddam
light
?
''
I
did
n't
turn
it
off
right
away
,
though
.
I
just
kept
laying
there
on
Ely
's
bed
,
thinking
about
Jane
and
all
.
It
just
drove
me
stark
staring
mad
when
I
thought
about
her
and
Stradlater
parked
somewhere
in
that
fat-assed
Ed
Banky
's
car
.
Every
time
I
thought
about
it
,
I
felt
like
jumping
out
the
window
.
The
thing
is
,
you
did
n't
know
Stradlater
.
I
knew
him
.
Most
guys
at
Pencey
just
talked
about
having
sexual
intercourse
with
girls
all
the
time
--
like
Ackley
,
for
instance
--
but
old
Stradlater
really
did
it
.
I
was
personally
acquainted
with
at
least
two
girls
he
gave
the
time
to
.
That
's
the
truth
.
``
Tell
me
the
story
of
your
fascinating
life
,
Ackley
kid
,
''
I
said
.
``
How
'bout
turning
off
the
goddam
light
?
I
got
ta
get
up
for
Mass
in
the
morning
.
''
I
got
up
and
turned
it
off
,
if
it
made
him
happy
.
Then
I
laid
down
on
Ely
's
bed
again
.
``
What
're
ya
gon
na
do
--
sleep
in
Ely
's
bed
?
''
Ackley
said
.
He
was
the
perfect
host
,
boy
.
``
I
may
.
I
may
not
.
Do
n't
worry
about
it
.
''
``
I
'm
not
worried
about
it
.
Only
,
I
'd
hate
like
hell
if
Ely
came
in
all
of
a
sudden
and
found
some
guy
--
''
``
Relax
.
I
'm
not
gon
na
sleep
here
.
I
would
n't
abuse
your
goddam
hospitality
.
''
A
couple
of
minutes
later
,
he
was
snoring
like
mad
.
I
kept
laying
there
in
the
dark
anyway
,
though
,
trying
not
to
think
about
old
Jane
and
Stradlater
in
that
goddam
Ed
Banky
's
car
.
But
it
was
almost
impossible
.
The
trouble
was
,
I
knew
that
guy
Stradlater
's
technique
.
That
made
it
even
worse
.
We
once
double-dated
,
in
Ed
Banky
's
car
,
and
Stradlater
was
in
the
back
,
with
his
date
,
and
I
was
in
the
front
with
mine
.
What
a
technique
that
guy
had
.
What
he
'd
do
was
,
he
'd
start
snowing
his
date
in
this
very
quiet
,
sincere
voice
--
like
as
if
he
was
n't
only
a
very
handsome
guy
but
a
nice
,
sincere
guy
,
too
.
I
damn
near
puked
,
listening
to
him
.
His
date
kept
saying
,
``
No
--
please
.
Please
,
do
n't
.
Please
.
''
But
old
Stradlater
kept
snowing
her
in
this
Abraham
Lincoln
,
sincere
voice
,
and
finally
there
'd
be
this
terrific
silence
in
the
back
of
the
car
.
It
was
really
embarrassing
.
I
do
n't
think
he
gave
that
girl
the
time
that
night
--
but
damn
near
.
Damn
near
.
While
I
was
laying
there
trying
not
to
think
,
I
heard
old
Stradlater
come
back
from
the
can
and
go
in
our
room
.
You
could
hear
him
putting
away
his
crumby
toilet
articles
and
all
,
and
opening
the
window
.
He
was
a
fresh-air
fiend
.
Then
,
a
little
while
later
,
he
turned
off
the
light
.
He
did
n't
even
look
around
to
see
where
I
was
at
.
It
was
even
depressing
out
in
the
street
.
You
could
n't
even
hear
any
cars
any
more
.
I
got
feeling
so
lonesome
and
rotten
,
I
even
felt
like
waking
Ackley
up
.
``
Hey
,
Ackley
,
''
I
said
,
in
sort
of
a
whisper
,
so
Stradlater
could
n't
hear
me
through
the
shower
curtain
.
Ackley
did
n't
hear
me
,
though
.
``
Hey
,
Ackley
!
''
He
still
did
n't
hear
me
.
He
slept
like
a
rock
.
``
Hey
,
Ackley
!
''
He
heard
that
,
all
right
.
``
What
the
hell
's
the
matter
with
you
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
was
asleep
,
for
Chrissake
.
''
``
Listen
.
What
's
the
routine
on
joining
a
monastery
?
''
I
asked
him
.
I
was
sort
of
toying
with
the
idea
of
joining
one
.
``
Do
you
have
to
be
a
Catholic
and
all
?
''
``
Certainly
you
have
to
be
a
Catholic
.
You
bastard
,
did
you
wake
me
just
to
ask
me
a
dumb
ques
--
''
``
Aah
,
go
back
to
sleep
.
I
'm
not
gon
na
join
one
anyway
.
The
kind
of
luck
I
have
,
I
'd
probably
join
one
with
all
the
wrong
kind
of
monks
in
it
.
All
stupid
bastards
.
Or
just
bastards
.
''
When
I
said
that
,
old
Ackley
sat
way
the
hell
up
in
bed
.
``
Listen
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
do
n't
care
what
you
say
about
me
or
anything
,
but
if
you
start
making
cracks
about
my
goddam
religion
,
for
Chrissake
--
''
``
Relax
,
''
I
said
.
``
Nobody
's
making
any
cracks
about
your
goddam
religion
.
''
I
got
up
off
Ely
's
bed
,
and
started
towards
the
door
.
I
did
n't
want
to
hang
around
in
that
stupid
atmosphere
any
more
.
I
stopped
on
the
way
,
though
,
and
picked
up
Ackley
's
hand
,
and
gave
him
a
big
,
phony
handshake
.
He
pulled
it
away
from
me
.
``
What
's
the
idea
?
''
he
said
.
``
No
idea
.
I
just
want
to
thank
you
for
being
such
a
goddam
prince
,
that
's
all
,
''
I
said
.
I
said
it
in
this
very
sincere
voice
.
``
You
're
aces
,
Ackley
kid
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
know
that
?
''
``
Wise
guy
.
Someday
somebody
's
gon
na
bash
your
--
''
I
did
n't
even
bother
to
listen
to
him
.
I
shut
the
damn
door
and
went
out
in
the
corridor
.
Everybody
was
asleep
or
out
or
home
for
the
week
end
,
and
it
was
very
,
very
quiet
and
depressing
in
the
corridor
.
There
was
this
empty
box
of
Kolynos
toothpaste
outside
Leahy
and
Hoffman
's
door
,
and
while
I
walked
down
towards
the
stairs
,
I
kept
giving
it
a
boot
with
this
sheep-lined
slipper
I
had
on
.
What
I
thought
I
'd
do
,
I
thought
I
might
go
down
and
see
what
old
Mal
Brossard
was
doing
.
But
all
of
a
sudden
,
I
changed
my
mind
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
I
decided
what
I
'd
really
do
,
I
'd
get
the
hell
out
of
Pencey
--
right
that
same
night
and
all
.
I
mean
not
wait
till
Wednesday
or
anything
.
I
just
did
n't
want
to
hang
around
any
more
.
It
made
me
too
sad
and
lonesome
.
So
what
I
decided
to
do
,
I
decided
I
'd
take
a
room
in
a
hotel
in
New
York
--
some
very
inexpensive
hotel
and
all
--
and
just
take
it
easy
till
Wednesday
.
Then
,
on
Wednesday
,
I
'd
go
home
all
rested
up
and
feeling
swell
.
I
figured
my
parents
probably
would
n't
get
old
Thurmer
's
letter
saying
I
'd
been
given
the
ax
till
maybe
Tuesday
or
Wednesday
.
I
did
n't
want
to
go
home
or
anything
till
they
got
it
and
thoroughly
digested
it
and
all
.
I
did
n't
want
to
be
around
when
they
first
got
it
.
My
mother
gets
very
hysterical
.
She
's
not
too
bad
after
she
gets
something
thoroughly
digested
,
though
.
Besides
,
I
sort
of
needed
a
little
vacation
.
My
nerves
were
shot
.
They
really
were
.
Anyway
,
that
's
what
I
decided
I
'd
do
.
So
I
went
back
to
the
room
and
turned
on
the
light
,
to
start
packing
and
all
.
I
already
had
quite
a
few
things
packed
.
Old
Stradlater
did
n't
even
wake
up
.
I
lit
a
cigarette
and
got
all
dressed
and
then
I
packed
these
two
Gladstones
I
have
.
It
only
took
me
about
two
minutes
.
I
'm
a
very
rapid
packer
.
One
thing
about
packing
depressed
me
a
little
.
I
had
to
pack
these
brand-new
ice
skates
my
mother
had
practically
just
sent
me
a
couple
of
days
before
.
That
depressed
me
.
I
could
see
my
mother
going
in
Spaulding
's
and
asking
the
salesman
a
million
dopy
questions
--
and
here
I
was
getting
the
ax
again
.
It
made
me
feel
pretty
sad
.
She
bought
me
the
wrong
kind
of
skates
--
I
wanted
racing
skates
and
she
bought
hockey
--
but
it
made
me
sad
anyway
.
Almost
every
time
somebody
gives
me
a
present
,
it
ends
up
making
me
sad
.
After
I
got
all
packed
,
I
sort
of
counted
my
dough
.
I
do
n't
remember
exactly
how
much
I
had
,
but
I
was
pretty
loaded
.
My
grandmother
'd
just
sent
me
a
wad
about
a
week
before
.
I
have
this
grandmother
that
's
quite
lavish
with
her
dough
.
She
does
n't
have
all
her
marbles
any
more
--
she
's
old
as
hell
--
and
she
keeps
sending
me
money
for
my
birthday
about
four
times
a
year
.
Anyway
,
even
though
I
was
pretty
loaded
,
I
figured
I
could
always
use
a
few
extra
bucks
.
You
never
know
.
So
what
I
did
was
,
I
went
down
the
hail
and
woke
up
Frederick
Woodruff
,
this
guy
I
'd
lent
my
typewriter
to
.
I
asked
him
how
much
he
'd
give
me
for
it
.
He
was
a
pretty
wealthy
guy
.
He
said
he
did
n't
know
.
He
said
he
did
n't
much
want
to
buy
it
.
Finally
he
bought
it
,
though
.
It
cost
about
ninety
bucks
,
and
all
he
bought
it
for
was
twenty
.
He
was
sore
because
I
'd
woke
him
up
.
When
I
was
all
set
to
go
,
when
I
had
my
bags
and
all
,
I
stood
for
a
while
next
to
the
stairs
and
took
a
last
look
down
the
goddam
corridor
.
I
was
sort
of
crying
.
I
do
n't
know
why
.
I
put
my
red
hunting
hat
on
,
and
turned
the
peak
around
to
the
back
,
the
way
I
liked
it
,
and
then
I
yelled
at
the
top
of
my
goddam
voice
,
``
Sleep
tight
,
ya
morons
!
''
I
'll
bet
I
woke
up
every
bastard
on
the
whole
floor
.
Then
I
got
the
hell
out
.
Some
stupid
guy
had
thrown
peanut
shells
all
over
the
stairs
,
and
I
damn
near
broke
my
crazy
neck
.
8
It
was
too
late
to
call
up
for
a
cab
or
anything
,
so
I
walked
the
whole
way
to
the
station
.
It
was
n't
too
far
,
but
it
was
cold
as
hell
,
and
the
snow
made
it
hard
for
walking
,
and
my
Gladstones
kept
banging
hell
out
of
my
legs
.
I
sort
of
enjoyed
the
air
and
all
,
though
.
The
only
trouble
was
,
the
cold
made
my
nose
hurt
,
and
right
under
my
upper
lip
,
where
old
Stradlater
'd
laid
one
on
me
.
He
'd
smacked
my
lip
right
on
my
teeth
,
and
it
was
pretty
sore
.
My
ears
were
nice
and
warm
,
though
.
That
hat
I
bought
had
earlaps
in
it
,
and
I
put
them
on
--
I
did
n't
give
a
damn
how
I
looked
.
Nobody
was
around
anyway
.
Everybody
was
in
the
sack
.
I
was
quite
lucky
when
I
got
to
the
station
,
because
I
only
had
to
wait
about
ten
minutes
for
a
train
.
While
I
waited
,
I
got
some
snow
in
my
hand
and
washed
my
face
with
it
.
I
still
had
quite
a
bit
of
blood
on
.
Usually
I
like
riding
on
trains
,
especially
at
night
,
with
the
lights
on
and
the
windows
so
black
,
and
one
of
those
guys
coming
up
the
aisle
selling
coffee
and
sandwiches
and
magazines
.
I
usually
buy
a
ham
sandwich
and
about
four
magazines
.
If
I
'm
on
a
train
at
night
,
I
can
usually
even
read
one
of
those
dumb
stories
in
a
magazine
without
puking
.
You
know
.
One
of
those
stories
with
a
lot
of
phony
,
lean-jawed
guys
named
David
in
it
,
and
a
lot
of
phony
girls
named
Linda
or
Marcia
that
are
always
lighting
all
the
goddam
Davids
'
pipes
for
them
.
I
can
even
read
one
of
those
lousy
stories
on
a
train
at
night
,
usually
.
But
this
time
,
it
was
different
.
I
just
did
n't
feel
like
it
.
I
just
sort
of
sat
and
not
did
anything
.
All
I
did
was
take
off
my
hunting
hat
and
put
it
in
my
pocket
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
this
lady
got
on
at
Trenton
and
sat
down
next
to
me
.
Practically
the
whole
car
was
empty
,
because
it
was
pretty
late
and
all
,
but
she
sat
down
next
to
me
,
instead
of
an
empty
seat
,
because
she
had
this
big
bag
with
her
and
I
was
sitting
in
the
front
seat
.
She
stuck
the
bag
right
out
in
the
middle
of
the
aisle
,
where
the
conductor
and
everybody
could
trip
over
it
.
She
had
these
orchids
on
,
like
she
'd
just
been
to
a
big
party
or
something
.
She
was
around
forty
or
forty-five
,
I
guess
,
but
she
was
very
good
looking
.
Women
kill
me
.
They
really
do
.
I
do
n't
mean
I
'm
oversexed
or
anything
like
that
--
although
I
am
quite
sexy
.
I
just
like
them
,
I
mean
.
They
're
always
leaving
their
goddam
bags
out
in
the
middle
of
the
aisle
.
Anyway
,
we
were
sitting
there
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
said
to
me
,
``
Excuse
me
,
but
is
n't
that
a
Pencey
Prep
sticker
?
''
She
was
looking
up
at
my
suitcases
,
up
on
the
rack
.
``
Yes
,
it
is
,
''
I
said
.
She
was
right
.
I
did
have
a
goddam
Pencey
sticker
on
one
of
my
Gladstones
.
Very
corny
,
I
'll
admit
.
``
Oh
,
do
you
go
to
Pencey
?
''
she
said
.
She
had
a
nice
voice
.
A
nice
telephone
voice
,
mostly
.
She
should
've
carried
a
goddam
telephone
around
with
her
.
``
Yes
,
I
do
,
''
I
said
.
``
Oh
,
how
lovely
!
Perhaps
you
know
my
son
,
then
,
Ernest
Morrow
?
He
goes
to
Pencey
.
''
``
Yes
,
I
do
.
He
's
in
my
class
.
''
Her
son
was
doubtless
the
biggest
bastard
that
ever
went
to
Pencey
,
in
the
whole
crumby
history
of
the
school
.
He
was
always
going
down
the
corridor
,
after
he
'd
had
a
shower
,
snapping
his
soggy
old
wet
towel
at
people
's
asses
.
That
's
exactly
the
kind
of
a
guy
he
was
.
``
Oh
,
how
nice
!
''
the
lady
said
.
But
not
corny
.
She
was
just
nice
and
all
.
``
I
must
tell
Ernest
we
met
,
''
she
said
.
``
May
I
ask
your
name
,
dear
?
''
``
Rudolf
Schmidt
,
''
I
told
her
.
I
did
n't
feel
like
giving
her
my
whole
life
history
.
Rudolf
Schmidt
was
the
name
of
the
janitor
of
our
dorm
.
``
Do
you
like
Pencey
?
''
she
asked
me
.
``
Pencey
?
It
's
not
too
bad
.
It
's
not
paradise
or
anything
,
but
it
's
as
good
as
most
schools
.
Some
of
the
faculty
are
pretty
conscientious
.
''
``
Ernest
just
adores
it
.
''
``
I
know
he
does
,
''
I
said
.
Then
I
started
shooting
the
old
crap
around
a
little
bit
.
``
He
adapts
himself
very
well
to
things
.
He
really
does
.
I
mean
he
really
knows
how
to
adapt
himself
.
''
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
she
asked
me
.
She
sounded
interested
as
hell
.
``
Ernest
?
Sure
,
''
I
said
.
Then
I
watched
her
take
off
her
gloves
.
Boy
,
was
she
lousy
with
rocks
.
``
I
just
broke
a
nail
,
getting
out
of
a
cab
,
''
she
said
.
She
looked
up
at
me
and
sort
of
smiled
.
She
had
a
terrifically
nice
smile
.
She
really
did
.
Most
people
have
hardly
any
smile
at
all
,
or
a
lousy
one
.
``
Ernest
's
father
and
I
sometimes
worry
about
him
,
''
she
said
.
``
We
sometimes
feel
he
's
not
a
terribly
good
mixer
.
''
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
``
Well
.
He
's
a
very
sensitive
boy
.
He
's
really
never
been
a
terribly
good
mixer
with
other
boys
.
Perhaps
he
takes
things
a
little
more
seriously
than
he
should
at
his
age
.
''
Sensitive
.
That
killed
me
.
That
guy
Morrow
was
about
as
sensitive
as
a
goddam
toilet
seat
.
I
gave
her
a
good
look
.
She
did
n't
look
like
any
dope
to
me
.
She
looked
like
she
might
have
a
pretty
damn
good
idea
what
a
bastard
she
was
the
mother
of
.
But
you
ca
n't
always
tell
--
with
somebody
's
mother
,
I
mean
.
Mothers
are
all
slightly
insane
.
The
thing
is
,
though
,
I
liked
old
Morrow
's
mother
.
She
was
all
right
.
``
Would
you
care
for
a
cigarette
?
''
I
asked
her
.
She
looked
all
around
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
this
is
a
smoker
,
Rudolf
,
''
she
said
.
Rudolf
.
That
killed
me
.
``
That
's
all
right
.
We
can
smoke
till
they
start
screaming
at
us
,
''
I
said
.
She
took
a
cigarette
off
me
,
and
I
gave
her
a
light
.
She
looked
nice
,
smoking
.
She
inhaled
and
all
,
but
she
did
n't
wolf
the
smoke
down
,
the
way
most
women
around
her
age
do
.
She
had
a
lot
of
charm
.
She
had
quite
a
lot
of
sex
appeal
,
too
,
if
you
really
want
to
know
.
She
was
looking
at
me
sort
of
funny
.
I
may
be
wrong
but
I
believe
your
nose
is
bleeding
,
dear
,
she
said
,
all
of
a
sudden
.
I
nodded
and
took
out
my
handkerchief
.
``
I
got
hit
with
a
snowball
,
''
I
said
.
``
One
of
those
very
icy
ones
.
''
I
probably
would
've
told
her
what
really
happened
,
but
it
would
've
taken
too
long
.
I
liked
her
,
though
.
I
was
beginning
to
feel
sort
of
sorry
I
'd
told
her
my
name
was
Rudolf
Schmidt
.
``
Old
Ernie
,
''
I
said
.
``
He
's
one
of
the
most
popular
boys
at
Pencey
.
Did
you
know
that
?
''
``
No
,
I
did
n't
.
''
I
nodded
.
``
It
really
took
everybody
quite
a
long
time
to
get
to
know
him
.
He
's
a
funny
guy
.
A
strange
guy
,
in
lots
of
ways
--
know
what
I
mean
?
Like
when
I
first
met
him
.
When
I
first
met
him
,
I
thought
he
was
kind
of
a
snobbish
person
.
That
's
what
I
thought
.
But
he
is
n't
.
He
's
just
got
this
very
original
personality
that
takes
you
a
little
while
to
get
to
know
him
.
''
Old
Mrs.
Morrow
did
n't
say
anything
,
but
boy
,
you
should
've
seen
her
.
I
had
her
glued
to
her
seat
.
You
take
somebody
's
mother
,
all
they
want
to
hear
about
is
what
a
hot-
shot
their
son
is
.
Then
I
really
started
chucking
the
old
crap
around
.
``
Did
he
tell
you
about
the
elections
?
''
I
asked
her
.
``
The
class
elections
?
''
She
shook
her
head
.
I
had
her
in
a
trance
,
like
.
I
really
did
.
``
Well
,
a
bunch
of
us
wanted
old
Ernie
to
be
president
of
the
class
.
I
mean
he
was
the
unanimous
choice
.
I
mean
he
was
the
only
boy
that
could
really
handle
the
job
,
''
I
said
--
boy
,
was
I
chucking
it
.
``
But
this
other
boy
--
Harry
Fencer
--
was
elected
.
And
the
reason
he
was
elected
,
the
simple
and
obvious
reason
,
was
because
Ernie
would
n't
let
us
nominate
him
.
Because
he
's
so
darn
shy
and
modest
and
all
.
He
refused
.
.
.
Boy
,
he
's
really
shy
.
You
oughta
make
him
try
to
get
over
that
.
''
I
looked
at
her
.
``
Did
n't
he
tell
you
about
it
?
''
``
No
,
he
did
n't
.
''
I
nodded
.
``
That
's
Ernie
.
He
would
n't
.
That
's
the
one
fault
with
him
--
he
's
too
shy
and
modest
.
You
really
oughta
get
him
to
try
to
relax
occasionally
.
''
Right
that
minute
,
the
conductor
came
around
for
old
Mrs.
Morrow
's
ticket
,
and
it
gave
me
a
chance
to
quit
shooting
it
.
I
'm
glad
I
shot
it
for
a
while
,
though
.
You
take
a
guy
like
Morrow
that
's
always
snapping
their
towel
at
people
's
asses
--
really
trying
to
hurt
somebody
with
it
--
they
do
n't
just
stay
a
rat
while
they
're
a
kid
.
They
stay
a
rat
their
whole
life
.
But
I
'll
bet
,
after
all
the
crap
I
shot
,
Mrs.
Morrow
'll
keep
thinking
of
him
now
as
this
very
shy
,
modest
guy
that
would
n't
let
us
nominate
him
for
president
.
She
might
.
You
ca
n't
tell
.
Mothers
are
n't
too
sharp
about
that
stuff
.
``
Would
you
care
for
a
cocktail
?
''
I
asked
her
.
I
was
feeling
in
the
mood
for
one
myself
.
``
We
can
go
in
the
club
car
.
All
right
?
''
``
Dear
,
are
you
allowed
to
order
drinks
?
''
she
asked
me
.
Not
snotty
,
though
.
She
was
too
charming
and
all
to
be
snotty
.
``
Well
,
no
,
not
exactly
,
but
I
can
usually
get
them
on
account
of
my
heighth
,
''
I
said
.
``
And
I
have
quite
a
bit
of
gray
hair
.
''
I
turned
sideways
and
showed
her
my
gray
hair
.
It
fascinated
hell
out
of
her
.
``
C'mon
,
join
me
,
why
do
n't
you
?
''
I
said
.
I'd
've
enjoyed
having
her
.
``
I
really
do
n't
think
I
'd
better
.
Thank
you
so
much
,
though
,
dear
,
''
she
said
.
``
Anyway
,
the
club
car
's
most
likely
closed
.
It
's
quite
late
,
you
know
.
''
She
was
right
.
I
'd
forgotten
all
about
what
time
it
was
.
Then
she
looked
at
me
and
asked
me
what
I
was
afraid
she
was
going
to
ask
me
.
``
Ernest
wrote
that
he
'd
be
home
on
Wednesday
,
that
Christmas
vacation
would
start
on
Wednesday
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
hope
you
were
n't
called
home
suddenly
because
of
illness
in
the
family
.
''
She
really
looked
worried
about
it
.
She
was
n't
just
being
nosy
,
you
could
tell
.
``
No
,
everybody
's
fine
at
home
,
''
I
said
.
``
It
's
me
.
I
have
to
have
this
operation
.
''
``
Oh
!
I
'm
so
sorry
,
''
she
said
.
She
really
was
,
too
.
I
was
right
away
sorry
I
'd
said
it
,
but
it
was
too
late
.
``
It
is
n't
very
serious
.
I
have
this
tiny
little
tumor
on
the
brain
.
''
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
She
put
her
hand
up
to
her
mouth
and
all
.
``
Oh
,
I
'll
be
all
right
and
everything
!
It
's
right
near
the
outside
.
And
it
's
a
very
tiny
one
.
They
can
take
it
out
in
about
two
minutes
.
''
Then
I
started
reading
this
timetable
I
had
in
my
pocket
.
Just
to
stop
lying
.
Once
I
get
started
,
I
can
go
on
for
hours
if
I
feel
like
it
.
No
kidding
.
Hours
.
We
did
n't
talk
too
much
after
that
.
She
started
reading
this
Vogue
she
had
with
her
,
and
I
looked
out
the
window
for
a
while
.
She
got
off
at
Newark
.
She
wished
me
a
lot
of
luck
with
the
operation
and
all
.
She
kept
calling
me
Rudolf
.
Then
she
invited
me
to
visit
Ernie
during
the
summer
,
at
Gloucester
,
Massachusetts
.
She
said
their
house
was
right
on
the
beach
,
and
they
had
a
tennis
court
and
all
,
but
I
just
thanked
her
and
told
her
I
was
going
to
South
America
with
my
grandmother
.
Which
was
really
a
hot
one
,
because
my
grandmother
hardly
ever
even
goes
out
of
the
house
,
except
maybe
to
go
to
a
goddam
matinee
or
something
.
But
I
would
n't
visit
that
sonuvabitch
Morrow
for
all
the
dough
in
the
world
,
even
if
I
was
desperate
.
9
The
first
thing
I
did
when
I
got
off
at
Penn
Station
,
I
went
into
this
phone
booth
.
I
felt
like
giving
somebody
a
buzz
.
I
left
my
bags
right
outside
the
booth
so
that
I
could
watch
them
,
but
as
soon
as
I
was
inside
,
I
could
n't
think
of
anybody
to
call
up
.
My
brother
D.B
.
was
in
Hollywood
.
My
kid
sister
Phoebe
goes
to
bed
around
nine
o'clock
--
so
I
could
n't
call
her
up
.
She
wouldn't
've
cared
if
I
'd
woke
her
up
,
but
the
trouble
was
,
she
wouldn't
've
been
the
one
that
answered
the
phone
.
My
parents
would
be
the
ones
.
So
that
was
out
.
Then
I
thought
of
giving
Jane
Gallagher
's
mother
a
buzz
,
and
find
out
when
Jane
's
vacation
started
,
but
I
did
n't
feel
like
it
.
Besides
,
it
was
pretty
late
to
call
up
.
Then
I
thought
of
calling
this
girl
I
used
to
go
around
with
quite
frequently
,
Sally
Hayes
,
because
I
knew
her
Christmas
vacation
had
started
already
--
she
'd
written
me
this
long
,
phony
letter
,
inviting
me
over
to
help
her
trim
the
Christmas
tree
Christmas
Eve
and
all
--
but
I
was
afraid
her
mother
'd
answer
the
phone
.
Her
mother
knew
my
mother
,
and
I
could
picture
her
breaking
a
goddam
leg
to
get
to
the
phone
and
tell
my
mother
I
was
in
New
York
.
Besides
,
I
was
n't
crazy
about
talking
to
old
Mrs.
Hayes
on
the
phone
.
She
once
told
Sally
I
was
wild
.
She
said
I
was
wild
and
that
I
had
no
direction
in
life
.
Then
I
thought
of
calling
up
this
guy
that
went
to
the
Whooton
School
when
I
was
there
,
Carl
Luce
,
but
I
did
n't
like
him
much
.
So
I
ended
up
not
calling
anybody
.
I
came
out
of
the
booth
,
after
about
twenty
minutes
or
so
,
and
got
my
bags
and
walked
over
to
that
tunnel
where
the
cabs
are
and
got
a
cab
.
I
'm
so
damn
absent-minded
,
I
gave
the
driver
my
regular
address
,
just
out
of
habit
and
all
--
I
mean
I
completely
forgot
I
was
going
to
shack
up
in
a
hotel
for
a
couple
of
days
and
not
go
home
till
vacation
started
.
I
did
n't
think
of
it
till
we
were
halfway
through
the
park
.
Then
I
said
,
``
Hey
,
do
you
mind
turning
around
when
you
get
a
chance
?
I
gave
you
the
wrong
address
.
I
want
to
go
back
downtown
.
''
The
driver
was
sort
of
a
wise
guy
.
``
I
ca
n't
turn
around
here
,
Mac
.
This
here
's
a
one-way
.
I
'll
have
to
go
all
the
way
to
Ninedieth
Street
now
.
''
I
did
n't
want
to
start
an
argument
.
``
Okay
,
''
I
said
.
Then
I
thought
of
something
,
all
of
a
sudden
.
``
Hey
,
listen
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
know
those
ducks
in
that
lagoon
right
near
Central
Park
South
?
That
little
lake
?
By
any
chance
,
do
you
happen
to
know
where
they
go
,
the
ducks
,
when
it
gets
all
frozen
over
?
Do
you
happen
to
know
,
by
any
chance
?
''
I
realized
it
was
only
one
chance
in
a
million
.
He
turned
around
and
looked
at
me
like
I
was
a
madman
.
``
What
're
ya
tryna
do
,
bud
?
''
he
said
.
``
Kid
me
?
''
``
No
--
I
was
just
interested
,
that
's
all
.
''
He
did
n't
say
anything
more
,
so
I
did
n't
either
.
Until
we
came
out
of
the
park
at
Ninetieth
Street
.
Then
he
said
,
``
All
right
,
buddy
.
Where
to
?
''
``
Well
,
the
thing
is
,
I
do
n't
want
to
stay
at
any
hotels
on
the
East
Side
where
I
might
run
into
some
acquaintances
of
mine
.
I
'm
traveling
incognito
,
''
I
said
.
I
hate
saying
corny
things
like
``
traveling
incognito
.
''
But
when
I
'm
with
somebody
that
's
corny
,
I
always
act
corny
too
.
``
Do
you
happen
to
know
whose
band
's
at
the
Taft
or
the
New
Yorker
,
by
any
chance
?
''
``
No
idear
,
Mac
.
''
``
Well
--
take
me
to
the
Edmont
then
,
''
I
said
.
``
Would
you
care
to
stop
on
the
way
and
join
me
for
a
cocktail
?
On
me
.
I
'm
loaded
.
''
``
Ca
n't
do
it
,
Mac
.
Sorry
.
''
He
certainly
was
good
company
.
Terrific
personality
.
We
got
to
the
Edmont
Hotel
,
and
I
checked
in
.
I
'd
put
on
my
red
hunting
cap
when
I
was
in
the
cab
,
just
for
the
hell
of
it
,
but
I
took
it
off
before
I
checked
in
.
I
did
n't
want
to
look
like
a
screwball
or
something
.
Which
is
really
ironic
.
I
did
n't
know
then
that
the
goddam
hotel
was
full
of
perverts
and
morons
.
Screwballs
all
over
the
place
.
They
gave
me
this
very
crumby
room
,
with
nothing
to
look
out
of
the
window
at
except
the
other
side
of
the
hotel
.
I
did
n't
care
much
.
I
was
too
depressed
to
care
whether
I
had
a
good
view
or
not
.
The
bellboy
that
showed
me
to
the
room
was
this
very
old
guy
around
sixty-five
.
He
was
even
more
depressing
than
the
room
was
.
He
was
one
of
those
bald
guys
that
comb
all
their
hair
over
from
the
side
to
cover
up
the
baldness
.
I
'd
rather
be
bald
than
do
that
.
Anyway
,
what
a
gorgeous
job
for
a
guy
around
sixty-five
years
old
.
Carrying
people
's
suitcases
and
waiting
around
for
a
tip
.
I
suppose
he
was
n't
too
intelligent
or
anything
,
but
it
was
terrible
anyway
.
After
he
left
,
I
looked
out
the
window
for
a
while
,
with
my
coat
on
and
all
.
I
did
n't
have
anything
else
to
do
.
You
'd
be
surprised
what
was
going
on
on
the
other
side
of
the
hotel
.
They
did
n't
even
bother
to
pull
their
shades
down
.
I
saw
one
guy
,
a
gray-haired
,
very
distinguished-looking
guy
with
only
his
shorts
on
,
do
something
you
would
n't
believe
me
if
I
told
you
.
First
he
put
his
suitcase
on
the
bed
.
Then
he
took
out
all
these
women
's
clothes
,
and
put
them
on
.
Real
women
's
clothes
--
silk
stockings
,
high-heeled
shoes
,
brassiere
,
and
one
of
those
corsets
with
the
straps
hanging
down
and
all
.
Then
he
put
on
this
very
tight
black
evening
dress
.
I
swear
to
God
.
Then
he
started
walking
up
and
down
the
room
,
taking
these
very
small
steps
,
the
way
a
woman
does
,
and
smoking
a
cigarette
and
looking
at
himself
in
the
mirror
.
He
was
all
alone
,
too
.
Unless
somebody
was
in
the
bathroom
--
I
could
n't
see
that
much
.
Then
,
in
the
window
almost
right
over
his
,
I
saw
a
man
and
a
woman
squirting
water
out
of
their
mouths
at
each
other
.
It
probably
was
highballs
,
not
water
,
but
I
could
n't
see
what
they
had
in
their
glasses
.
Anyway
,
first
he
'd
take
a
swallow
and
squirt
it
all
over
her
,
then
she
did
it
to
him
--
they
took
turns
,
for
God
's
sake
.
You
should
've
seen
them
.
They
were
in
hysterics
the
whole
time
,
like
it
was
the
funniest
thing
that
ever
happened
.
I
'm
not
kidding
,
the
hotel
was
lousy
with
perverts
.
I
was
probably
the
only
normal
bastard
in
the
whole
place
--
and
that
is
n't
saying
much
.
I
damn
near
sent
a
telegram
to
old
Stradlater
telling
him
to
take
the
first
train
to
New
York
.
He
'd
have
been
the
king
of
the
hotel
.
The
trouble
was
,
that
kind
of
junk
is
sort
of
fascinating
to
watch
,
even
if
you
do
n't
want
it
to
be
.
For
instance
,
that
girl
that
was
getting
water
squirted
all
over
her
face
,
she
was
pretty
good-looking
.
I
mean
that
's
my
big
trouble
.
In
my
mind
,
I
'm
probably
the
biggest
sex
maniac
you
ever
saw
.
Sometimes
I
can
think
of
very
crumby
stuff
I
would
n't
mind
doing
if
the
opportunity
came
up
.
I
can
even
see
how
it
might
be
quite
a
lot
of
fun
,
in
a
crumby
way
,
and
if
you
were
both
sort
of
drunk
and
all
,
to
get
a
girl
and
squirt
water
or
something
all
over
each
other
's
face
.
The
thing
is
,
though
,
I
do
n't
like
the
idea
.
It
stinks
,
if
you
analyze
it
.
I
think
if
you
do
n't
really
like
a
girl
,
you
should
n't
horse
around
with
her
at
all
,
and
if
you
do
like
her
,
then
you
're
supposed
to
like
her
face
,
and
if
you
like
her
face
,
you
ought
to
be
careful
about
doing
crumby
stuff
to
it
,
like
squirting
water
all
over
it
.
It
's
really
too
bad
that
so
much
crumby
stuff
is
a
lot
of
fun
sometimes
.
Girls
are
n't
too
much
help
,
either
,
when
you
start
trying
not
to
get
too
crumby
,
when
you
start
trying
not
to
spoil
anything
really
good
.
I
knew
this
one
girl
,
a
couple
of
years
ago
,
that
was
even
crumbier
than
I
was
.
Boy
,
was
she
crumby
!
We
had
a
lot
of
fun
,
though
,
for
a
while
,
in
a
crumby
way
.
Sex
is
something
I
really
do
n't
understand
too
hot
.
You
never
know
where
the
hell
you
are
.
I
keep
making
up
these
sex
rules
for
myself
,
and
then
I
break
them
right
away
.
Last
year
I
made
a
rule
that
I
was
going
to
quit
horsing
around
with
girls
that
,
deep
down
,
gave
me
a
pain
in
the
ass
.
I
broke
it
,
though
,
the
same
week
I
made
it
--
the
same
night
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
.
I
spent
the
whole
night
necking
with
a
terrible
phony
named
Anne
Louise
Sherman
.
Sex
is
something
I
just
do
n't
understand
.
I
swear
to
God
I
do
n't
.
I
started
toying
with
the
idea
,
while
I
kept
standing
there
,
of
giving
old
Jane
a
buzz
--
I
mean
calling
her
long
distance
at
B.M.
,
where
she
went
,
instead
of
calling
up
her
mother
to
find
out
when
she
was
coming
home
.
You
were
n't
supposed
to
call
students
up
late
at
night
,
but
I
had
it
all
figured
out
.
I
was
going
to
tell
whoever
answered
the
phone
that
I
was
her
uncle
.
I
was
going
to
say
her
aunt
had
just
got
killed
in
a
car
accident
and
I
had
to
speak
to
her
immediately
.
It
would
've
worked
,
too
.
The
only
reason
I
did
n't
do
it
was
because
I
was
n't
in
the
mood
.
If
you
're
not
in
the
mood
,
you
ca
n't
do
that
stuff
right
.
After
a
while
I
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
smoked
a
couple
of
cigarettes
.
I
was
feeling
pretty
horny
.
I
have
to
admit
it
.
Then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
I
got
this
idea
.
I
took
out
my
wallet
and
started
looking
for
this
address
a
guy
I
met
at
a
party
last
summer
,
that
went
to
Princeton
,
gave
me
.
Finally
I
found
it
.
It
was
all
a
funny
color
from
my
wallet
,
but
you
could
still
read
it
.
It
was
the
address
of
this
girl
that
was
n't
exactly
a
whore
or
anything
but
that
did
n't
mind
doing
it
once
in
a
while
,
this
Princeton
guy
told
me
.
He
brought
her
to
a
dance
at
Princeton
once
,
and
they
nearly
kicked
him
out
for
bringing
her
.
She
used
to
be
a
burlesque
stripper
or
something
.
Anyway
,
I
went
over
to
the
phone
and
gave
her
a
buzz
.
Her
name
was
Faith
Cavendish
,
and
she
lived
at
the
Stanford
Arms
Hotel
on
Sixty-fifth
and
Broadway
.
A
dump
,
no
doubt
.
For
a
while
,
I
didn
t
think
she
was
home
or
something
.
Nobody
kept
answering
.
Then
,
finally
,
somebody
picked
up
the
phone
.
``
Hello
?
''
I
said
.
I
made
my
voice
quite
deep
so
that
she
would
n't
suspect
my
age
or
anything
.
I
have
a
pretty
deep
voice
anyway
.
``
Hello
,
''
this
woman
's
voice
said
.
None
too
friendly
,
either
.
``
Is
this
Miss
Faith
Cavendish
?
''
``
Who
's
this
?
''
she
said
.
``
Who
's
calling
me
up
at
this
crazy
goddam
hour
?
''
That
sort
of
scared
me
a
little
bit
.
``
Well
,
I
know
it
's
quite
late
,
''
I
said
,
in
this
very
mature
voice
and
all
.
``
I
hope
you
'll
forgive
me
,
but
I
was
very
anxious
to
get
in
touch
with
you
.
''
I
said
it
suave
as
hell
.
I
really
did
.
``
Who
is
this
?
''
she
said
.
``
Well
,
you
do
n't
know
me
,
but
I
'm
a
friend
of
Eddie
Birdsell
's
.
He
suggested
that
if
I
were
in
town
sometime
,
we
ought
to
get
together
for
a
cocktail
or
two
.
''
``
Who
?
You
're
a
friend
of
who
?
''
Boy
,
she
was
a
real
tigress
over
the
phone
.
She
was
damn
near
yelling
at
me
.
``
Edmund
Birdsell
.
Eddie
Birdsell
,
''
I
said
.
I
could
n't
remember
if
his
name
was
Edmund
or
Edward
.
I
only
met
him
once
,
at
a
goddam
stupid
party
.
``
I
do
n't
know
anybody
by
that
name
,
Jack
.
And
if
you
think
I
enjoy
bein
'
woke
up
in
the
middle
--
''
``
Eddie
Birdsell
?
From
Princeton
?
''
I
said
.
You
could
tell
she
was
running
the
name
over
in
her
mind
and
all
.
``
Birdsell
,
Birdsell
.
.
.
from
Princeton..
.
Princeton
College
?
''
``
That
's
right
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
from
Princeton
College
?
''
``
Well
,
approximately
.
''
``
Oh
.
.
.
How
is
Eddie
?
''
she
said
.
``
This
is
certainly
a
peculiar
time
to
call
a
person
up
,
though
.
Jesus
Christ
.
''
``
He
's
fine
.
He
asked
to
be
remembered
to
you
.
''
``
Well
,
thank
you
.
Remember
me
to
him
,
''
she
said
.
``
He
's
a
grand
person
.
What
's
he
doing
now
?
''
She
was
getting
friendly
as
hell
,
all
of
a
sudden
.
``
Oh
,
you
know
.
Same
old
stuff
,
''
I
said
.
How
the
hell
did
I
know
what
he
was
doing
?
I
hardly
knew
the
guy
.
I
did
n't
even
know
if
he
was
still
at
Princeton
.
``
Look
,
''
I
said
.
``
Would
you
be
interested
in
meeting
me
for
a
cocktail
somewhere
?
''
``
By
any
chance
do
you
have
any
idea
what
time
it
is
?
''
she
said
.
``
What
's
your
name
,
anyhow
,
may
I
ask
?
''
She
was
getting
an
English
accent
,
all
of
a
sudden
.
``
You
sound
a
little
on
the
young
side
.
''
I
laughed
.
``
Thank
you
for
the
compliment
,
''
I
said
--
suave
as
hell
.
``
Holden
Caulfield
's
my
name
.
''
I
should
've
given
her
a
phony
name
,
but
I
did
n't
think
of
it
.
``
Well
,
look
,
Mr.
Cawffle
.
I
'm
not
in
the
habit
of
making
engagements
in
the
middle
of
the
night
.
I
'm
a
working
gal
.
''
``
Tomorrow
's
Sunday
,
''
I
told
her
.
``
Well
,
anyway
.
I
got
ta
get
my
beauty
sleep
.
You
know
how
it
is
.
''
``
I
thought
we
might
have
just
one
cocktail
together
.
It
is
n't
too
late
.
''
``
Well
.
You
're
very
sweet
,
''
she
said
.
``
Where
ya
callin
'
from
?
Where
ya
at
now
,
anyways
?
''
``
Me
?
I
'm
in
a
phone
booth
.
''
``
Oh
,
''
she
said
.
Then
there
was
this
very
long
pause
.
``
Well
,
I
'd
like
awfully
to
get
together
with
you
sometime
,
Mr.
Cawffle
.
You
sound
very
attractive
.
You
sound
like
a
very
attractive
person
.
But
it
is
late
.
''
``
I
could
come
up
to
your
place
.
''
``
Well
,
ordinary
,
I
'd
say
grand
.
I
mean
I
'd
love
to
have
you
drop
up
for
a
cocktail
,
but
my
roommate
happens
to
be
ill.
She
's
been
laying
here
all
night
without
a
wink
of
sleep
.
She
just
this
minute
closed
her
eyes
and
all
.
I
mean
.
''
``
Oh
.
That
's
too
bad
.
''
``
Where
ya
stopping
at
?
Perhaps
we
could
get
together
for
cocktails
tomorrow
.
''
``
I
ca
n't
make
it
tomorrow
,
''
I
said
.
``
Tonight
's
the
only
time
I
can
make
it
.
''
What
a
dope
I
was
.
I
shouldn't
've
said
that
.
``
Oh
.
Well
,
I
'm
awfully
sorry
.
''
``
I
'll
say
hello
to
Eddie
for
you
.
''
``
Willya
do
that
?
I
hope
you
enjoy
your
stay
in
New
York
.
It
's
a
grand
place
.
''
``
I
know
it
is
.
Thanks
.
Good
night
,
''
I
said
.
Then
I
hung
up
.
Boy
,
I
really
fouled
that
up
.
I
should
've
at
least
made
it
for
cocktails
or
something
.
10
It
was
still
pretty
early
.
I
'm
not
sure
what
time
it
was
,
but
it
was
n't
too
late
.
The
one
thing
I
hate
to
do
is
go
to
bed
when
I
'm
not
even
tired
.
So
I
opened
my
suitcases
and
took
out
a
clean
shirt
,
and
then
I
went
in
the
bathroom
and
washed
and
changed
my
shirt
.
What
I
thought
I
'd
do
,
I
thought
I
'd
go
downstairs
and
see
what
the
hell
was
going
on
in
the
Lavender
Room
.
They
had
this
night
club
,
the
Lavender
Room
,
in
the
hotel
.
While
I
was
changing
my
shirt
,
I
damn
near
gave
my
kid
sister
Phoebe
a
buzz
,
though
.
I
certainly
felt
like
talking
to
her
on
the
phone
.
Somebody
with
sense
and
all
.
But
I
could
n't
take
a
chance
on
giving
her
a
buzz
,
because
she
was
only
a
little
kid
and
she
would
n't
have
been
up
,
let
alone
anywhere
near
the
phone
.
I
thought
of
maybe
hanging
up
if
my
parents
answered
,
but
that
wouldn't
've
worked
,
either
.
They
'd
know
it
was
me
.
My
mother
always
knows
it
's
me
.
She
's
psychic
.
But
I
certainly
would
n't
have
minded
shooting
the
crap
with
old
Phoebe
for
a
while
.
You
should
see
her
.
You
never
saw
a
little
kid
so
pretty
and
smart
in
your
whole
life
.
She
's
really
smart
.
I
mean
she
's
had
all
A
's
ever
since
she
started
school
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
I
'm
the
only
dumb
one
in
the
family
.
My
brother
D.B
.
's
a
writer
and
all
,
and
my
brother
Allie
,
the
one
that
died
,
that
I
told
you
about
,
was
a
wizard
.
I
'm
the
only
really
dumb
one
.
But
you
ought
to
see
old
Phoebe
.
She
has
this
sort
of
red
hair
,
a
little
bit
like
Allie
's
was
,
that
's
very
short
in
the
summertime
.
In
the
summertime
,
she
sticks
it
behind
her
ears
.
She
has
nice
,
pretty
little
ears
.
In
the
wintertime
,
it
's
pretty
long
,
though
.
Sometimes
my
mother
braids
it
and
sometimes
she
does
n't
.
It
's
really
nice
,
though
.
She
's
only
ten
.
She
's
quite
skinny
,
like
me
,
but
nice
skinny
.
Roller-skate
skinny
.
I
watched
her
once
from
the
window
when
she
was
crossing
over
Fifth
Avenue
to
go
to
the
park
,
and
that
's
what
she
is
,
roller-skate
skinny
.
You
'd
like
her
.
I
mean
if
you
tell
old
Phoebe
something
,
she
knows
exactly
what
the
hell
you
're
talking
about
.
I
mean
you
can
even
take
her
anywhere
with
you
.
If
you
take
her
to
a
lousy
movie
,
for
instance
,
she
knows
it
's
a
lousy
movie
.
If
you
take
her
to
a
pretty
good
movie
,
she
knows
it
's
a
pretty
good
movie
.
D.B
.
and
I
took
her
to
see
this
French
movie
,
The
Baker
's
Wife
,
with
Raimu
in
it
.
It
killed
her
.
Her
favorite
is
The
39
Steps
,
though
,
with
Robert
Donat
.
She
knows
the
whole
goddam
movie
by
heart
,
because
I
've
taken
her
to
see
it
about
ten
times
.
When
old
Donat
comes
up
to
this
Scotch
farmhouse
,
for
instance
,
when
he
's
running
away
from
the
cops
and
all
,
Phoebe
'll
say
right
out
loud
in
the
movie
--
right
when
the
Scotch
guy
in
the
picture
says
it
--
''
Can
you
eat
the
herring
?
''
She
knows
all
the
talk
by
heart
.
And
when
this
professor
in
the
picture
,
that
's
really
a
German
spy
,
sticks
up
his
little
finger
with
part
of
the
middle
joint
missing
,
to
show
Robert
Donat
,
old
Phoebe
beats
him
to
it
--
she
holds
up
her
little
finger
at
me
in
the
dark
,
right
in
front
of
my
face
.
She
's
all
right
.
You
'd
like
her
.
The
only
trouble
is
,
she
's
a
little
too
affectionate
sometimes
.
She
's
very
emotional
,
for
a
child
.
She
really
is
.
Something
else
she
does
,
she
writes
books
all
the
time
.
Only
,
she
does
n't
finish
them
.
They
're
all
about
some
kid
named
Hazel
Weatherfield
--
only
old
Phoebe
spells
it
``
Hazle
.
''
Old
Hazle
Weatherfield
is
a
girl
detective
.
She
's
supposed
to
be
an
orphan
,
but
her
old
man
keeps
showing
up
.
Her
old
man
's
always
a
``
tall
attractive
gentleman
about
20
years
of
age
.
''
That
kills
me
.
Old
Phoebe
.
I
swear
to
God
you
'd
like
her
.
She
was
smart
even
when
she
was
a
very
tiny
little
kid
.
When
she
was
a
very
tiny
little
kid
,
I
and
Allie
used
to
take
her
to
the
park
with
us
,
especially
on
Sundays
.
Allie
had
this
sailboat
he
used
to
like
to
fool
around
with
on
Sundays
,
and
we
used
to
take
old
Phoebe
with
us
.
She
'd
wear
white
gloves
and
walk
right
between
us
,
like
a
lady
and
all
.
And
when
Allie
and
I
were
having
some
conversation
about
things
in
general
,
old
Phoebe
'd
be
listening
.
Sometimes
you
'd
forget
she
was
around
,
because
she
was
such
a
little
kid
,
but
she
'd
let
you
know
.
She
'd
interrupt
you
all
the
time
.
She
'd
give
Allie
or
I
a
push
or
something
,
and
say
,
``
Who
?
Who
said
that
?
Bobby
or
the
lady
?
''
And
we
'd
tell
her
who
said
it
,
and
she
'd
say
,
``
Oh
,
''
and
go
right
on
listening
and
all
.
She
killed
Allie
,
too
.
I
mean
he
liked
her
,
too
.
She
's
ten
now
,
and
not
such
a
tiny
little
kid
any
more
,
but
she
still
kills
everybody
--
everybody
with
any
sense
,
anyway
.
Anyway
,
she
was
somebody
you
always
felt
like
talking
to
on
the
phone
.
But
I
was
too
afraid
my
parents
would
answer
,
and
then
they
'd
find
out
I
was
in
New
York
and
kicked
out
of
Pencey
and
all
.
So
I
just
finished
putting
on
my
shirt
.
Then
I
got
all
ready
and
went
down
in
the
elevator
to
the
lobby
to
see
what
was
going
on
.
Except
for
a
few
pimpy-looking
guys
,
and
a
few
whory-looking
blondes
,
the
lobby
was
pretty
empty
.
But
you
could
hear
the
band
playing
in
the
Lavender
Room
,
and
so
I
went
in
there
.
It
was
n't
very
crowded
,
but
they
gave
me
a
lousy
table
anyway
--
way
in
the
back
.
I
should
've
waved
a
buck
under
the
head-waiter
's
nose
.
In
New
York
,
boy
,
money
really
talks
--
I
'm
not
kidding
.
The
band
was
putrid
.
Buddy
Singer
.
Very
brassy
,
but
not
good
brassy
--
corny
brassy
.
Also
,
there
were
very
few
people
around
my
age
in
the
place
.
In
fact
,
nobody
was
around
my
age
.
They
were
mostly
old
,
show-offy-looking
guys
with
their
dates
.
Except
at
the
table
right
next
to
me
.
At
the
table
right
next
to
me
,
there
were
these
three
girls
around
thirty
or
so
.
The
whole
three
of
them
were
pretty
ugly
,
and
they
all
had
on
the
kind
of
hats
that
you
knew
they
did
n't
really
live
in
New
York
,
but
one
of
them
,
the
blonde
one
,
was
n't
too
bad
.
She
was
sort
of
cute
,
the
blonde
one
,
and
I
started
giving
her
the
old
eye
a
little
bit
,
but
just
then
the
waiter
came
up
for
my
order
.
I
ordered
a
Scotch
and
soda
,
and
told
him
not
to
mix
it
--
I
said
it
fast
as
hell
,
because
if
you
hem
and
haw
,
they
think
you
're
under
twenty-one
and
wo
n't
sell
you
any
intoxicating
liquor
.
I
had
trouble
with
him
anyway
,
though
.
``
I
'm
sorry
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
do
you
have
some
verification
of
your
age
?
Your
driver
's
license
,
perhaps
?
''
I
gave
him
this
very
cold
stare
,
like
he
'd
insulted
the
hell
out
of
me
,
and
asked
him
,
``
Do
I
look
like
I
'm
under
twenty-one
?
''
``
I
'm
sorry
,
sir
,
but
we
have
our
--
''
``
Okay
,
okay
,
''
I
said
.
I
figured
the
hell
with
it
.
``
Bring
me
a
Coke
.
''
He
started
to
go
away
,
but
I
called
him
back
.
``
Can'tcha
stick
a
little
rum
in
it
or
something
?
''
I
asked
him
.
I
asked
him
very
nicely
and
all
.
``
I
ca
n't
sit
in
a
corny
place
like
this
cold
sober
.
Can'tcha
stick
a
little
rum
in
it
or
something
?
''
``
I
'm
very
sorry
,
sir
.
.
.
''
he
said
,
and
beat
it
on
me
.
I
did
n't
hold
it
against
him
,
though
.
They
lose
their
jobs
if
they
get
caught
selling
to
a
minor
.
I
'm
a
goddam
minor
.
I
started
giving
the
three
witches
at
the
next
table
the
eye
again
.
That
is
,
the
blonde
one
.
The
other
two
were
strictly
from
hunger
.
I
did
n't
do
it
crudely
,
though
.
I
just
gave
all
three
of
them
this
very
cool
glance
and
all
.
What
they
did
,
though
,
the
three
of
them
,
when
I
did
it
,
they
started
giggling
like
morons
.
They
probably
thought
I
was
too
young
to
give
anybody
the
once-over
.
That
annoyed
hell
out
of
me
--
you'd
've
thought
I
wanted
to
marry
them
or
something
.
I
should
've
given
them
the
freeze
,
after
they
did
that
,
but
the
trouble
was
,
I
really
felt
like
dancing
.
I
'm
very
fond
of
dancing
,
sometimes
,
and
that
was
one
of
the
times
.
So
all
of
a
sudden
,
I
sort
of
leaned
over
and
said
,
``
Would
any
of
you
girls
care
to
dance
?
''
I
did
n't
ask
them
crudely
or
anything
.
Very
suave
,
in
fact
.
But
God
damn
it
,
they
thought
that
was
a
panic
,
too
.
They
started
giggling
some
more
.
I
'm
not
kidding
,
they
were
three
real
morons
.
``
C'mon
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
'll
dance
with
you
one
at
a
time
.
All
right
?
How
'bout
it
?
C'mon
!
''
I
really
felt
like
dancing
.
Finally
,
the
blonde
one
got
up
to
dance
with
me
,
because
you
could
tell
I
was
really
talking
to
her
,
and
we
walked
out
to
the
dance
floor
.
The
other
two
grools
nearly
had
hysterics
when
we
did
.
I
certainly
must
've
been
very
hard
up
to
even
bother
with
any
of
them
.
But
it
was
worth
it
.
The
blonde
was
some
dancer
.
She
was
one
of
the
best
dancers
I
ever
danced
with
.
I
'm
not
kidding
,
some
of
these
very
stupid
girls
can
really
knock
you
out
on
a
dance
floor
.
You
take
a
really
smart
girl
,
and
half
the
time
she
's
trying
to
lead
you
around
the
dance
floor
,
or
else
she
's
such
a
lousy
dancer
,
the
best
thing
to
do
is
stay
at
the
table
and
just
get
drunk
with
her
.
``
You
really
can
dance
,
''
I
told
the
blonde
one
.
``
You
oughta
be
a
pro
.
I
mean
it
.
I
danced
with
a
pro
once
,
and
you
're
twice
as
good
as
she
was
.
Did
you
ever
hear
of
Marco
and
Miranda
?
''
``
What
?
''
she
said
.
She
was
n't
even
listening
to
me
.
She
was
looking
all
around
the
place
.
``
I
said
did
you
ever
hear
of
Marco
and
Miranda
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
.
No
.
I
do
n't
know
.
''
``
Well
,
they
're
dancers
,
she
's
a
dancer
.
She
's
not
too
hot
,
though
.
She
does
everything
she
's
supposed
to
,
but
she
's
not
so
hot
anyway
.
You
know
when
a
girl
's
really
a
terrific
dancer
?
''
``
Wudga
say
?
''
she
said
.
She
was
n't
listening
to
me
,
even
.
Her
mind
was
wandering
all
over
the
place
.
``
I
said
do
you
know
when
a
girl
's
really
a
terrific
dancer
?
''
``
Uh-uh
.
''
``
Well
--
where
I
have
my
hand
on
your
back
.
If
I
think
there
is
n't
anything
underneath
my
hand
--
no
can
,
no
legs
,
no
feet
,
no
anything
--
then
the
girl
's
really
a
terrific
dancer
.
''
She
was
n't
listening
,
though
.
So
I
ignored
her
for
a
while
.
We
just
danced
.
God
,
could
that
dopey
girl
dance
.
Buddy
Singer
and
his
stinking
band
was
playing
``
Just
One
of
Those
Things
''
and
even
they
could
n't
ruin
it
entirely
.
It
's
a
swell
song
.
I
did
n't
try
any
trick
stuff
while
we
danced
--
I
hate
a
guy
that
does
a
lot
of
show-off
tricky
stuff
on
the
dance
floor
--
but
I
was
moving
her
around
plenty
,
and
she
stayed
with
me
.
The
funny
thing
is
,
I
thought
she
was
enjoying
it
,
too
,
till
all
of
a
sudden
she
came
out
with
this
very
dumb
remark
.
``
I
and
my
girl
friends
saw
Peter
Lorre
last
night
,
''
she
said
.
``
The
movie
actor
.
In
person
.
He
was
buyin
'
a
newspaper
.
He
's
cute
.
''
``
You
're
lucky
,
''
I
told
her
.
``
You
're
really
lucky
.
You
know
that
?
''
She
was
really
a
moron
.
But
what
a
dancer
.
I
could
hardly
stop
myself
from
sort
of
giving
her
a
kiss
on
the
top
of
her
dopey
head
--
you
know
--
right
where
the
part
is
,
and
all
.
She
got
sore
when
I
did
it
.
``
Hey
!
What
's
the
idea
?
''
``
Nothing
.
No
idea
.
You
really
can
dance
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
have
a
kid
sister
that
's
only
in
the
goddam
fourth
grade
.
You
're
about
as
good
as
she
is
,
and
she
can
dance
better
than
anybody
living
or
dead
.
''
``
Watch
your
language
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
.
''
What
a
lady
,
boy
.
A
queen
,
for
Chrissake
.
``
Where
you
girls
from
?
''
I
asked
her
.
She
did
n't
answer
me
,
though
.
She
was
busy
looking
around
for
old
Peter
Lorre
to
show
up
,
I
guess
.
``
Where
you
girls
from
?
''
I
asked
her
again
.
``
What
?
''
she
said
.
``
Where
you
girls
from
?
Do
n't
answer
if
you
do
n't
feel
like
it
.
I
do
n't
want
you
to
strain
yourself
.
''
``
Seattle
,
Washington
,
''
she
said
.
She
was
doing
me
a
big
favor
to
tell
me
.
``
You
're
a
very
good
conversationalist
,
''
I
told
her
.
``
You
know
that
?
''
``
What
?
''
I
let
it
drop
.
It
was
over
her
head
,
anyway
.
``
Do
you
feel
like
jitterbugging
a
little
bit
,
if
they
play
a
fast
one
?
Not
corny
jitterbug
,
not
jump
or
anything
--
just
nice
and
easy
.
Everybody
'll
all
sit
down
when
they
play
a
fast
one
,
except
the
old
guys
and
the
fat
guys
,
and
we
'll
have
plenty
of
room
.
Okay
?
''
``
It
's
immaterial
to
me
,
''
she
said
.
``
Hey
--
how
old
are
you
,
anyhow
?
''
That
annoyed
me
,
for
some
reason
.
``
Oh
,
Christ
.
Do
n't
spoil
it
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
'm
twelve
,
for
Chrissake
.
I
'm
big
for
my
age
.
''
``
Listen
.
I
toleja
about
that
.
I
do
n't
like
that
type
language
,
''
she
said
.
``
If
you
're
gon
na
use
that
type
language
,
I
can
go
sit
down
with
my
girl
friends
,
you
know
.
''
I
apologized
like
a
madman
,
because
the
band
was
starting
a
fast
one
.
She
started
jitterbugging
with
me
--
but
just
very
nice
and
easy
,
not
corny
.
She
was
really
good
.
All
you
had
to
do
was
touch
her
.
And
when
she
turned
around
,
her
pretty
little
butt
twitched
so
nice
and
all
.
She
knocked
me
out
.
I
mean
it
.
I
was
half
in
love
with
her
by
the
time
we
sat
down
.
That
's
the
thing
about
girls
.
Every
time
they
do
something
pretty
,
even
if
they
're
not
much
to
look
at
,
or
even
if
they
're
sort
of
stupid
,
you
fall
half
in
love
with
them
,
and
then
you
never
know
where
the
hell
you
are
.
Girls
.
Jesus
Christ
.
They
can
drive
you
crazy
.
They
really
can
.
They
did
n't
invite
me
to
sit
down
at
their
table
--
mostly
because
they
were
too
ignorant
--
but
I
sat
down
anyway
.
The
blonde
I
'd
been
dancing
with
's
name
was
Bernice
something
--
Crabs
or
Krebs
.
The
two
ugly
ones
'
names
were
Marty
and
Laverne
.
I
told
them
my
name
was
Jim
Steele
,
just
for
the
hell
of
it
.
Then
I
tried
to
get
them
in
a
little
intelligent
conversation
,
but
it
was
practically
impossible
.
You
had
to
twist
their
arms
.
You
could
hardly
tell
which
was
the
stupidest
of
the
three
of
them
.
And
the
whole
three
of
them
kept
looking
all
around
the
goddam
room
,
like
as
if
they
expected
a
flock
of
goddam
movie
stars
to
come
in
any
minute
.
They
probably
thought
movie
stars
always
hung
out
in
the
Lavender
Room
when
they
came
to
New
York
,
instead
of
the
Stork
Club
or
El
Morocco
and
all
.
Anyway
,
it
took
me
about
a
half
hour
to
find
out
where
they
all
worked
and
all
in
Seattle
.
They
all
worked
in
the
same
insurance
office
.
I
asked
them
if
they
liked
it
,
but
do
you
think
you
could
get
an
intelligent
answer
out
of
those
three
dopes
?
I
thought
the
two
ugly
ones
,
Marty
and
Laverne
,
were
sisters
,
but
they
got
very
insulted
when
I
asked
them
.
You
could
tell
neither
one
of
them
wanted
to
look
like
the
other
one
,
and
you
could
n't
blame
them
,
but
it
was
very
amusing
anyway
.
I
danced
with
them
all
--
the
whole
three
of
them
--
one
at
a
time
.
The
one
ugly
one
,
Laverne
,
was
n't
too
bad
a
dancer
,
but
the
other
one
,
old
Marty
,
was
murder
.
Old
Marty
was
like
dragging
the
Statue
of
Liberty
around
the
floor
.
The
only
way
I
could
even
half
enjoy
myself
dragging
her
around
was
if
I
amused
myself
a
little
.
So
I
told
her
I
just
saw
Gary
Cooper
,
the
movie
star
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
floor
.
``
Where
?
''
she
asked
me
--
excited
as
hell
.
``
Where
?
''
``
Aw
,
you
just
missed
him
.
He
just
went
out
.
Why
did
n't
you
look
when
I
told
you
?
''
She
practically
stopped
dancing
,
and
started
looking
over
everybody
's
heads
to
see
if
she
could
see
him
.
``
Oh
,
shoot
!
''
she
said
.
I
'd
just
about
broken
her
heart
--
I
really
had
.
I
was
sorry
as
hell
I
'd
kidded
her
.
Some
people
you
should
n't
kid
,
even
if
they
deserve
it
.
Here
's
what
was
very
funny
,
though
.
When
we
got
back
to
the
table
,
old
Marty
told
the
other
two
that
Gary
Cooper
had
just
gone
out
.
Boy
,
old
Laverne
and
Bernice
nearly
committed
suicide
when
they
heard
that
.
They
got
all
excited
and
asked
Marty
if
she
'd
seen
him
and
all
.
Old
Mart
said
she
'd
only
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
.
That
killed
me
.
The
bar
was
closing
up
for
the
night
,
so
I
bought
them
all
two
drinks
apiece
quick
before
it
closed
,
and
I
ordered
two
more
Cokes
for
myself
.
The
goddam
table
was
lousy
with
glasses
.
The
one
ugly
one
,
Laverne
,
kept
kidding
me
because
I
was
only
drinking
Cokes
.
She
had
a
sterling
sense
of
humor
.
She
and
old
Marty
were
drinking
Tom
Collinses
--
in
the
middle
of
December
,
for
God
's
sake
.
They
did
n't
know
any
better
.
The
blonde
one
,
old
Bernice
,
was
drinking
bourbon
and
water
.
She
was
really
putting
it
away
,
too
.
The
whole
three
of
them
kept
looking
for
movie
stars
the
whole
time
.
They
hardly
talked
--
even
to
each
other
.
Old
Marty
talked
more
than
the
other
two
.
She
kept
saying
these
very
corny
,
boring
things
,
like
calling
the
can
the
``
little
girls
'
room
,
''
and
she
thought
Buddy
Singer
's
poor
old
beat-up
clarinet
player
was
really
terrific
when
he
stood
up
and
took
a
couple
of
ice-cold
hot
licks
.
She
called
his
clarinet
a
``
licorice
stick
.
''
Was
she
corny
.
The
other
ugly
one
,
Laverne
,
thought
she
was
a
very
witty
type
.
She
kept
asking
me
to
call
up
my
father
and
ask
him
what
he
was
doing
tonight
.
She
kept
asking
me
if
my
father
had
a
date
or
not
.
Four
times
she
asked
me
that
--
she
was
certainly
witty
.
Old
Bernice
,
the
blonde
one
,
did
n't
say
hardly
anything
at
all
.
Every
time
I
'd
ask
her
something
,
she
said
``
What
?
''
That
can
get
on
your
nerves
after
a
while
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
when
they
finished
their
drink
,
all
three
of
them
stood
up
on
me
and
said
they
had
to
get
to
bed
.
They
said
they
were
going
to
get
up
early
to
see
the
first
show
at
Radio
City
Music
Hall
.
I
tried
to
get
them
to
stick
around
for
a
while
,
but
they
would
n't
.
So
we
said
good-by
and
all
.
I
told
them
I
'd
look
them
up
in
Seattle
sometime
,
if
I
ever
got
there
,
but
I
doubt
if
I
ever
will
.
Look
them
up
,
I
mean
.
With
cigarettes
and
all
,
the
check
came
to
about
thirteen
bucks
.
I
think
they
should
've
at
least
offered
to
pay
for
the
drinks
they
had
before
I
joined
them
--
I
wouldn't
've
let
them
,
naturally
,
but
they
should
've
at
least
offered
.
I
did
n't
care
much
,
though
.
They
were
so
ignorant
,
and
they
had
those
sad
,
fancy
hats
on
and
all
.
And
that
business
about
getting
up
early
to
see
the
first
show
at
Radio
City
Music
Hall
depressed
me
.
If
somebody
,
some
girl
in
an
awful-looking
hat
,
for
instance
,
comes
all
the
way
to
New
York
--
from
Seattle
,
Washington
,
for
God
's
sake
--
and
ends
up
getting
up
early
in
the
morning
to
see
the
goddam
first
show
at
Radio
City
Music
Hall
,
it
makes
me
so
depressed
I
ca
n't
stand
it
.
I'd
've
bought
the
whole
three
of
them
a
hundred
drinks
if
only
they
had
n't
told
me
that
.
I
left
the
Lavender
Room
pretty
soon
after
they
did
.
They
were
closing
it
up
anyway
,
and
the
band
had
quit
a
long
time
ago
.
In
the
first
place
,
it
was
one
of
those
places
that
are
very
terrible
to
be
in
unless
you
have
somebody
good
to
dance
with
,
or
unless
the
waiter
lets
you
buy
real
drinks
instead
of
just
Cokes
.
There
is
n't
any
night
club
in
the
world
you
can
sit
in
for
a
long
time
unless
you
can
at
least
buy
some
liquor
and
get
drunk
.
Or
unless
you
're
with
some
girl
that
really
knocks
you
out
.
11
All
of
a
sudden
,
on
my
way
out
to
the
lobby
,
I
got
old
Jane
Gallagher
on
the
brain
again
.
I
got
her
on
,
and
I
could
n't
get
her
off
.
I
sat
down
in
this
vomity-looking
chair
in
the
lobby
and
thought
about
her
and
Stradlater
sitting
in
that
goddam
Ed
Banky
's
car
,
and
though
I
was
pretty
damn
sure
old
Stradlater
had
n't
given
her
the
time
--
I
know
old
Jane
like
a
book
--
I
still
could
n't
get
her
off
my
brain
.
I
knew
her
like
a
book
.
I
really
did
.
I
mean
,
besides
checkers
,
she
was
quite
fond
of
all
athletic
sports
,
and
after
I
got
to
know
her
,
the
whole
summer
long
we
played
tennis
together
almost
every
morning
and
golf
almost
every
afternoon
.
I
really
got
to
know
her
quite
intimately
.
I
do
n't
mean
it
was
anything
physical
or
anything
--
it
was
n't
--
but
we
saw
each
other
all
the
time
.
You
do
n't
always
have
to
get
too
sexy
to
get
to
know
a
girl
.
The
way
I
met
her
,
this
Doberman
pinscher
she
had
used
to
come
over
and
relieve
himself
on
our
lawn
,
and
my
mother
got
very
irritated
about
it
.
She
called
up
Jane
's
mother
and
made
a
big
stink
about
it
.
My
mother
can
make
a
very
big
stink
about
that
kind
of
stuff
.
Then
what
happened
,
a
couple
of
days
later
I
saw
Jane
laying
on
her
stomach
next
to
the
swimming
pool
,
at
the
club
,
and
I
said
hello
to
her
.
I
knew
she
lived
in
the
house
next
to
ours
,
but
I
'd
never
conversed
with
her
before
or
anything
.
She
gave
me
the
big
freeze
when
I
said
hello
that
day
,
though
.
I
had
a
helluva
time
convincing
her
that
I
did
n't
give
a
good
goddam
where
her
dog
relieved
himself
.
He
could
do
it
in
the
living
room
,
for
all
I
cared
.
Anyway
,
after
that
,
Jane
and
I
got
to
be
friends
and
all
.
I
played
golf
with
her
that
same
afternoon
.
She
lost
eight
balls
,
I
remember
.
Eight
.
I
had
a
terrible
time
getting
her
to
at
least
open
her
eyes
when
she
took
a
swing
at
the
ball
.
I
improved
her
game
immensely
,
though
.
I
'm
a
very
good
golfer
.
If
I
told
you
what
I
go
around
in
,
you
probably
would
n't
believe
me
.
I
almost
was
once
in
a
movie
short
,
but
I
changed
my
mind
at
the
last
minute
.
I
figured
that
anybody
that
hates
the
movies
as
much
as
I
do
,
I
'd
be
a
phony
if
I
let
them
stick
me
in
a
movie
short
.
She
was
a
funny
girl
,
old
Jane
.
I
would
n't
exactly
describe
her
as
strictly
beautiful
.
She
knocked
me
out
,
though
.
She
was
sort
of
muckle-mouthed
.
I
mean
when
she
was
talking
and
she
got
excited
about
something
,
her
mouth
sort
of
went
in
about
fifty
directions
,
her
lips
and
all
.
That
killed
me
.
And
she
never
really
closed
it
all
the
way
,
her
mouth
.
It
was
always
just
a
little
bit
open
,
especially
when
she
got
in
her
golf
stance
,
or
when
she
was
reading
a
book
.
She
was
always
reading
,
and
she
read
very
good
books
.
She
read
a
lot
of
poetry
and
all
.
She
was
the
only
one
,
outside
my
family
,
that
I
ever
showed
Allie
's
baseball
mitt
to
,
with
all
the
poems
written
on
it
.
She
'd
never
met
Allie
or
anything
,
because
that
was
her
first
summer
in
Maine
--
before
that
,
she
went
to
Cape
Cod-
-but
I
told
her
quite
a
lot
about
him
.
She
was
interested
in
that
kind
of
stuff
.
My
mother
did
n't
like
her
too
much
.
I
mean
my
mother
always
thought
Jane
and
her
mother
were
sort
of
snubbing
her
or
something
when
they
did
n't
say
hello
.
My
mother
saw
them
in
the
village
a
lot
,
because
Jane
used
to
drive
to
market
with
her
mother
in
this
LaSalle
convertible
they
had
.
My
mother
did
n't
think
Jane
was
pretty
,
even
.
I
did
,
though
.
I
just
liked
the
way
she
looked
,
that
's
all
.
I
remember
this
one
afternoon
.
It
was
the
only
time
old
Jane
and
I
ever
got
close
to
necking
,
even
.
It
was
a
Saturday
and
it
was
raining
like
a
bastard
out
,
and
I
was
over
at
her
house
,
on
the
porch
--
they
had
this
big
screened-in
porch
.
We
were
playing
checkers
.
I
used
to
kid
her
once
in
a
while
because
she
would
n't
take
her
kings
out
of
the
back
row
.
But
I
did
n't
kid
her
much
,
though
.
You
never
wanted
to
kid
Jane
too
much
.
I
think
I
really
like
it
best
when
you
can
kid
the
pants
off
a
girl
when
the
opportunity
arises
,
but
it
's
a
funny
thing
.
The
girls
I
like
best
are
the
ones
I
never
feel
much
like
kidding
.
Sometimes
I
think
they
'd
like
it
if
you
kidded
them
--
in
fact
,
I
know
they
would
--
but
it
's
hard
to
get
started
,
once
you
've
known
them
a
pretty
long
time
and
never
kidded
them
.
Anyway
,
I
was
telling
you
about
that
afternoon
Jane
and
I
came
close
to
necking
.
It
was
raining
like
hell
and
we
were
out
on
her
porch
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
this
booze
hound
her
mother
was
married
to
came
out
on
the
porch
and
asked
Jane
if
there
were
any
cigarettes
in
the
house
.
I
did
n't
know
him
too
well
or
anything
,
but
he
looked
like
the
kind
of
guy
that
would
n't
talk
to
you
much
unless
he
wanted
something
off
you
.
He
had
a
lousy
personality
.
Anyway
,
old
Jane
would
n't
answer
him
when
he
asked
her
if
she
knew
where
there
was
any
cigarettes
.
So
the
guy
asked
her
again
,
but
she
still
would
n't
answer
him
.
She
did
n't
even
look
up
from
the
game
.
Finally
the
guy
went
inside
the
house
.
When
he
did
,
I
asked
Jane
what
the
hell
was
going
on
.
She
would
n't
even
answer
me
,
then
.
She
made
out
like
she
was
concentrating
on
her
next
move
in
the
game
and
all
.
Then
all
of
a
sudden
,
this
tear
plopped
down
on
the
checkerboard
.
On
one
of
the
red
squares
--
boy
,
I
can
still
see
it
.
She
just
rubbed
it
into
the
board
with
her
finger
.
I
do
n't
know
why
,
but
it
bothered
hell
out
of
me
.
So
what
I
did
was
,
I
went
over
and
made
her
move
over
on
the
glider
so
that
I
could
sit
down
next
to
her
--
I
practically
sat
down
in
her
lap
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
.
Then
she
really
started
to
cry
,
and
the
next
thing
I
knew
,
I
was
kissing
her
all
over
--
anywhere
--
her
eyes
,
her
nose
,
her
forehead
,
her
eyebrows
and
all
,
her
ears
--
her
whole
face
except
her
mouth
and
all
.
She
sort
of
would
n't
let
me
get
to
her
mouth
.
Anyway
,
it
was
the
closest
we
ever
got
to
necking
.
After
a
while
,
she
got
up
and
went
in
and
put
on
this
red
and
white
sweater
she
had
,
that
knocked
me
out
,
and
we
went
to
a
goddam
movie
.
I
asked
her
,
on
the
way
,
if
Mr.
Cudahy
--
that
was
the
booze
hound
's
name
--
had
ever
tried
to
get
wise
with
her
.
She
was
pretty
young
,
but
she
had
this
terrific
figure
,
and
I
wouldn't
've
put
it
past
that
Cudahy
bastard
.
She
said
no
,
though
.
I
never
did
find
out
what
the
hell
was
the
matter
.
Some
girls
you
practically
never
find
out
what
's
the
matter
.
I
do
n't
want
you
to
get
the
idea
she
was
a
goddam
icicle
or
something
,
just
because
we
never
necked
or
horsed
around
much
.
She
was
n't
.
I
held
hands
with
her
all
the
time
,
for
instance
.
That
does
n't
sound
like
much
,
I
realize
,
but
she
was
terrific
to
hold
hands
with
.
Most
girls
if
you
hold
hands
with
them
,
their
goddam
hand
dies
on
you
,
or
else
they
think
they
have
to
keep
moving
their
hand
all
the
time
,
as
if
they
were
afraid
they
'd
bore
you
or
something
.
Jane
was
different
.
We
'd
get
into
a
goddam
movie
or
something
,
and
right
away
we
'd
start
holding
hands
,
and
we
would
n't
quit
till
the
movie
was
over
.
And
without
changing
the
position
or
making
a
big
deal
out
of
it
.
You
never
even
worried
,
with
Jane
,
whether
your
hand
was
sweaty
or
not
.
All
you
knew
was
,
you
were
happy
.
You
really
were
.
One
other
thing
I
just
thought
of
.
One
time
,
in
this
movie
,
Jane
did
something
that
just
about
knocked
me
out
.
The
newsreel
was
on
or
something
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
I
felt
this
hand
on
the
back
of
my
neck
,
and
it
was
Jane
's
.
It
was
a
funny
thing
to
do
.
I
mean
she
was
quite
young
and
all
,
and
most
girls
if
you
see
them
putting
their
hand
on
the
back
of
somebody
's
neck
,
they
're
around
twenty-five
or
thirty
and
usually
they
're
doing
it
to
their
husband
or
their
little
kid
--
I
do
it
to
my
kid
sister
Phoebe
once
in
a
while
,
for
instance
.
But
if
a
girl
's
quite
young
and
all
and
she
does
it
,
it
's
so
pretty
it
just
about
kills
you
.
Anyway
,
that
's
what
I
was
thinking
about
while
I
sat
in
that
vomity-looking
chair
in
the
lobby
.
Old
Jane
.
Every
time
I
got
to
the
part
about
her
out
with
Stradlater
in
that
damn
Ed
Banky
's
car
,
it
almost
drove
me
crazy
.
I
knew
she
would
n't
let
him
get
to
first
base
with
her
,
but
it
drove
me
crazy
anyway
.
I
do
n't
even
like
to
talk
about
it
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
There
was
hardly
anybody
in
the
lobby
any
more
.
Even
all
the
whory-looking
blondes
were
n't
around
any
more
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
I
felt
like
getting
the
hell
out
of
the
place
.
It
was
too
depressing
.
And
I
was
n't
tired
or
anything
.
So
I
went
up
to
my
room
and
put
on
my
coat
.
I
also
took
a
look
out
the
window
to
see
if
all
the
perverts
were
still
in
action
,
but
the
lights
and
all
were
out
now
.
I
went
down
in
the
elevator
again
and
got
a
cab
and
told
the
driver
to
take
me
down
to
Ernie
's
.
Ernie
's
is
this
night
club
in
Greenwich
Village
that
my
brother
D.B
.
used
to
go
to
quite
frequently
before
he
went
out
to
Hollywood
and
prostituted
himself
.
He
used
to
take
me
with
him
once
in
a
while
.
Ernie
's
a
big
fat
colored
guy
that
plays
the
piano
.
He
's
a
terrific
snob
and
he
wo
n't
hardly
even
talk
to
you
unless
you
're
a
big
shot
or
a
celebrity
or
something
,
but
he
can
really
play
the
piano
.
He
's
so
good
he
's
almost
corny
,
in
fact
.
I
do
n't
exactly
know
what
I
mean
by
that
,
but
I
mean
it
.
I
certainly
like
to
hear
him
play
,
but
sometimes
you
feel
like
turning
his
goddam
piano
over
.
I
think
it
's
because
sometimes
when
he
plays
,
he
sounds
like
the
kind
of
guy
that
wo
n't
talk
to
you
unless
you
're
a
big
shot
.

The
cab
I
had
was
a
real
old
one
that
smelled
like
someone
'd
just
tossed
his
cookies
in
it
.
I
always
get
those
vomity
kind
of
cabs
if
I
go
anywhere
late
at
night
.
What
made
it
worse
,
it
was
so
quiet
and
lonesome
out
,
even
though
it
was
Saturday
night
.
I
did
n't
see
hardly
anybody
on
the
street
.
Now
and
then
you
just
saw
a
man
and
a
girl
crossing
a
street
,
with
their
arms
around
each
other
's
waists
and
all
,
or
a
bunch
of
hoodlumy-looking
guys
and
their
dates
,
all
of
them
laughing
like
hyenas
at
something
you
could
bet
was
n't
funny
.
New
York
's
terrible
when
somebody
laughs
on
the
street
very
late
at
night
.
You
can
hear
it
for
miles
.
It
makes
you
feel
so
lonesome
and
depressed
.
I
kept
wishing
I
could
go
home
and
shoot
the
bull
for
a
while
with
old
Phoebe
.
But
finally
,
after
I
was
riding
a
while
,
the
cab
driver
and
I
sort
of
struck
up
a
conversation
.
His
name
was
Horwitz
.
He
was
a
much
better
guy
than
the
other
driver
I
'd
had
.
Anyway
,
I
thought
maybe
he
might
know
about
the
ducks
.
``
Hey
,
Horwitz
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
ever
pass
by
the
lagoon
in
Central
Park
?
Down
by
Central
Park
South
?
''
``
The
what
?
''
``
The
lagoon
.
That
little
lake
,
like
,
there
.
Where
the
ducks
are
.
You
know
.
''
``
Yeah
,
what
about
it
?
''
``
Well
,
you
know
the
ducks
that
swim
around
in
it
?
In
the
springtime
and
all
?
Do
you
happen
to
know
where
they
go
in
the
wintertime
,
by
any
chance
?
''
``
Where
who
goes
?
''
``
The
ducks
.
Do
you
know
,
by
any
chance
?
I
mean
does
somebody
come
around
in
a
truck
or
something
and
take
them
away
,
or
do
they
fly
away
by
themselves
--
go
south
or
something
?
''
Old
Horwitz
turned
all
the
way
around
and
looked
at
me
.
He
was
a
very
impatient-type
guy
.
He
was
n't
a
bad
guy
,
though
.
``
How
the
hell
should
I
know
?
''
he
said
.
``
How
the
hell
should
I
know
a
stupid
thing
like
that
?
''
``
Well
,
do
n't
get
sore
about
it
,
''
I
said
.
He
was
sore
about
it
or
something
.
``
Who
's
sore
?
Nobody
's
sore
.
''
I
stopped
having
a
conversation
with
him
,
if
he
was
going
to
get
so
damn
touchy
about
it
.
But
he
started
it
up
again
himself
.
He
turned
all
the
way
around
again
,
and
said
,
``
The
fish
do
n't
go
no
place
.
They
stay
right
where
they
are
,
the
fish
.
Right
in
the
goddam
lake
.
''
``
The
fish
--
that
's
different
.
The
fish
is
different
.
I
'm
talking
about
the
ducks
,
''
I
said
.
``
What
's
different
about
it
?
Nothin
's
different
about
it
,
''
Horwitz
said
.
Everything
he
said
,
he
sounded
sore
about
something
.
``
It
's
tougher
for
the
fish
,
the
winter
and
all
,
than
it
is
for
the
ducks
,
for
Chrissake
.
Use
your
head
,
for
Chrissake
.
''
I
did
n't
say
anything
for
about
a
minute
.
Then
I
said
,
``
All
right
.
What
do
they
do
,
the
fish
and
all
,
when
that
whole
little
lake
's
a
solid
block
of
ice
,
people
skating
on
it
and
all
?
''
Old
Horwitz
turned
around
again
.
``
What
the
hellaya
mean
what
do
they
do
?
''
he
yelled
at
me
.
``
They
stay
right
where
they
are
,
for
Chrissake
.
''
``
They
ca
n't
just
ignore
the
ice
.
They
ca
n't
just
ignore
it
.
''
``
Who
's
ignoring
it
?
Nobody
's
ignoring
it
!
''
Horwitz
said
.
He
got
so
damn
excited
and
all
,
I
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
drive
the
cab
right
into
a
lamppost
or
something
.
``
They
live
right
in
the
goddam
ice
.
It
's
their
nature
,
for
Chrissake
.
They
get
frozen
right
in
one
position
for
the
whole
winter
.
''
``
Yeah
?
What
do
they
eat
,
then
?
I
mean
if
they
're
frozen
solid
,
they
ca
n't
swim
around
looking
for
food
and
all
.
''
``
Their
bodies
,
for
Chrissake
--
what'sa
matter
with
ya
?
Their
bodies
take
in
nutrition
and
all
,
right
through
the
goddam
seaweed
and
crap
that
's
in
the
ice
.
They
got
their
pores
open
the
whole
time
.
That
's
their
nature
,
for
Chrissake
.
See
what
I
mean
?
''
He
turned
way
the
hell
around
again
to
look
at
me
.
``
Oh
,
''
I
said
.
I
let
it
drop
.
I
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
crack
the
damn
taxi
up
or
something
.
Besides
,
he
was
such
a
touchy
guy
,
it
was
n't
any
pleasure
discussing
anything
with
him
.
``
Would
you
care
to
stop
off
and
have
a
drink
with
me
somewhere
?
''
I
said
.
He
did
n't
answer
me
,
though
.
I
guess
he
was
still
thinking
.
I
asked
him
again
,
though
.
He
was
a
pretty
good
guy
.
Quite
amusing
and
all
.
``
I
ai
n't
got
no
time
for
no
liquor
,
bud
,
''
he
said
.
``
How
the
hell
old
are
you
,
anyways
?
Why
ain'tcha
home
in
bed
?
''
``
I
'm
not
tired
.
''
When
I
got
out
in
front
of
Ernie
's
and
paid
the
fare
,
old
Horwitz
brought
up
the
fish
again
.
He
certainly
had
it
on
his
mind
.
``
Listen
,
''
he
said
.
``
If
you
was
a
fish
,
Mother
Nature
'd
take
care
of
you
,
would
n't
she
?
Right
?
You
do
n't
think
them
fish
just
die
when
it
gets
to
be
winter
,
do
ya
?
''
``
No
,
but
--
''
``
You
're
goddam
right
they
do
n't
,
''
Horwitz
said
,
and
drove
off
like
a
bat
out
of
hell
.
He
was
about
the
touchiest
guy
I
ever
met
.
Everything
you
said
made
him
sore
.
Even
though
it
was
so
late
,
old
Ernie
's
was
jampacked
.
Mostly
with
prep
school
jerks
and
college
jerks
.
Almost
every
damn
school
in
the
world
gets
out
earlier
for
Christmas
vacation
than
the
schools
I
go
to
.
You
could
hardly
check
your
coat
,
it
was
so
crowded
.
It
was
pretty
quiet
,
though
,
because
Ernie
was
playing
the
piano
.
It
was
supposed
to
be
something
holy
,
for
God
's
sake
,
when
he
sat
down
at
the
piano
.
Nobody
's
that
good
.
About
three
couples
,
besides
me
,
were
waiting
for
tables
,
and
they
were
all
shoving
and
standing
on
tiptoes
to
get
a
look
at
old
Ernie
while
he
played
.
He
had
a
big
damn
mirror
in
front
of
the
piano
,
with
this
big
spotlight
on
him
,
so
that
everybody
could
watch
his
face
while
he
played
.
You
could
n't
see
his
fingers
while
he
played
--
just
his
big
old
face
.
Big
deal
.
I
'm
not
too
sure
what
the
name
of
the
song
was
that
he
was
playing
when
I
came
in
,
but
whatever
it
was
,
he
was
really
stinking
it
up
.
He
was
putting
all
these
dumb
,
show-offy
ripples
in
the
high
notes
,
and
a
lot
of
other
very
tricky
stuff
that
gives
me
a
pain
in
the
ass
.
You
should
've
heard
the
crowd
,
though
,
when
he
was
finished
.
You
would
've
puked
.
They
went
mad
.
They
were
exactly
the
same
morons
that
laugh
like
hyenas
in
the
movies
at
stuff
that
is
n't
funny
.
I
swear
to
God
,
if
I
were
a
piano
player
or
an
actor
or
something
and
all
those
dopes
thought
I
was
terrific
,
I
'd
hate
it
.
I
would
n't
even
want
them
to
clap
for
me
.
People
always
clap
for
the
wrong
things
.
If
I
were
a
piano
player
,
I
'd
play
it
in
the
goddam
closet
.
Anyway
,
when
he
was
finished
,
and
everybody
was
clapping
their
heads
off
,
old
Ernie
turned
around
on
his
stool
and
gave
this
very
phony
,
humble
bow
.
Like
as
if
he
was
a
helluva
humble
guy
,
besides
being
a
terrific
piano
player
.
It
was
very
phony
--
I
mean
him
being
such
a
big
snob
and
all
.
In
a
funny
way
,
though
,
I
felt
sort
of
sorry
for
him
when
he
was
finished
.
I
do
n't
even
think
he
knows
any
more
when
he
's
playing
right
or
not
.
It
is
n't
all
his
fault
.
I
partly
blame
all
those
dopes
that
clap
their
heads
off
--
they
'd
foul
up
anybody
,
if
you
gave
them
a
chance
.
Anyway
,
it
made
me
feel
depressed
and
lousy
again
,
and
I
damn
near
got
my
coat
back
and
went
back
to
the
hotel
,
but
it
was
too
early
and
I
did
n't
feel
much
like
being
all
alone
.
They
finally
got
me
this
stinking
table
,
right
up
against
a
wall
and
behind
a
goddam
post
,
where
you
could
n't
see
anything
.
It
was
one
of
those
tiny
little
tables
that
if
the
people
at
the
next
table
do
n't
get
up
to
let
you
by
--
and
they
never
do
,
the
bastards
--
you
practically
have
to
climb
into
your
chair
.
I
ordered
a
Scotch
and
soda
,
which
is
my
favorite
drink
,
next
to
frozen
Daiquiris
.
If
you
were
only
around
six
years
old
,
you
could
get
liquor
at
Ernie
's
,
the
place
was
so
dark
and
all
,
and
besides
,
nobody
cared
how
old
you
were
.
You
could
even
be
a
dope
fiend
and
nobody
'd
care
.
I
was
surrounded
by
jerks
.
I
'm
not
kidding
.
At
this
other
tiny
table
,
right
to
my
left
,
practically
on
top
of
me
,
there
was
this
funny-looking
guy
and
this
funny-looking
girl
.
They
were
around
my
age
,
or
maybe
just
a
little
older
.
It
was
funny
.
You
could
see
they
were
being
careful
as
hell
not
to
drink
up
the
minimum
too
fast
.
I
listened
to
their
conversation
for
a
while
,
because
I
did
n't
have
anything
else
to
do
.
He
was
telling
her
about
some
pro
football
game
he
'd
seen
that
afternoon
.
He
gave
her
every
single
goddam
play
in
the
whole
game
--
I
'm
not
kidding
.
He
was
the
most
boring
guy
I
ever
listened
to
.
And
you
could
tell
his
date
was
n't
even
interested
in
the
goddam
game
,
but
she
was
even
funnier-looking
than
he
was
,
so
I
guess
she
had
to
listen
.
Real
ugly
girls
have
it
tough
.
I
feel
so
sorry
for
them
sometimes
.
Sometimes
I
ca
n't
even
look
at
them
,
especially
if
they
're
with
some
dopey
guy
that
's
telling
them
all
about
a
goddam
football
game
.
On
my
right
,
the
conversation
was
even
worse
,
though
.
On
my
right
there
was
this
very
Joe
Yale-looking
guy
,
in
a
gray
flannel
suit
and
one
of
those
flitty-looking
Tattersall
vests
.
All
those
Ivy
League
bastards
look
alike
.
My
father
wants
me
to
go
to
Yale
,
or
maybe
Princeton
,
but
I
swear
,
I
would
n't
go
to
one
of
those
Ivy
League
colleges
,
if
I
was
dying
,
for
God
's
sake
.
Anyway
,
this
Joe
Yale-looking
guy
had
a
terrific-looking
girl
with
him
.
Boy
,
she
was
good-looking
.
But
you
should
've
heard
the
conversation
they
were
having
.
In
the
first
place
,
they
were
both
slightly
crocked
.
What
he
was
doing
,
he
was
giving
her
a
feel
under
the
table
,
and
at
the
same
time
telling
her
all
about
some
guy
in
his
dorm
that
had
eaten
a
whole
bottle
of
aspirin
and
nearly
committed
suicide
.
His
date
kept
saying
to
him
,
``
How
horrible
.
.
.
Do
n't
,
darling
.
Please
,
do
n't
.
Not
here
.
''
Imagine
giving
somebody
a
feel
and
telling
them
about
a
guy
committing
suicide
at
the
same
time
!
They
killed
me
.
I
certainly
began
to
feel
like
a
prize
horse
's
ass
,
though
,
sitting
there
all
by
myself
.
There
was
n't
anything
to
do
except
smoke
and
drink
.
What
I
did
do
,
though
,
I
told
the
waiter
to
ask
old
Ernie
if
he
'd
care
to
join
me
for
a
drink
.
I
told
him
to
tell
him
I
was
D.B
.
's
brother
.
I
do
n't
think
he
ever
even
gave
him
my
message
,
though
.
Those
bastards
never
give
your
message
to
anybody
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
this
girl
came
up
to
me
and
said
,
``
Holden
Caulfield
!
''
Her
name
was
Lillian
Simmons
.
My
brother
D.B
.
used
to
go
around
with
her
for
a
while
.
She
had
very
big
knockers
.
``
Hi
,
''
I
said
.
I
tried
to
get
up
,
naturally
,
but
it
was
some
job
getting
up
,
in
a
place
like
that
.
She
had
some
Navy
officer
with
her
that
looked
like
he
had
a
poker
up
his
ass
.
``
How
marvelous
to
see
you
!
''
old
Lillian
Simmons
said
.
Strictly
a
phony
.
``
How
's
your
big
brother
?
''
That
's
all
she
really
wanted
to
know
.
``
He
's
fine
.
He
's
in
Hollywood
.
''
``
In
Hollywood
!
How
marvelous
!
What
's
he
doing
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Writing
,
''
I
said
.
I
did
n't
feel
like
discussing
it
.
You
could
tell
she
thought
it
was
a
big
deal
,
his
being
in
Hollywood
.
Almost
everybody
does
.
Mostly
people
who
've
never
read
any
of
his
stories
.
It
drives
me
crazy
,
though
.
``
How
exciting
,
''
old
Lillian
said
.
Then
she
introduced
me
to
the
Navy
guy
.
His
name
was
Commander
Blop
or
something
.
He
was
one
of
those
guys
that
think
they
're
being
a
pansy
if
they
do
n't
break
around
forty
of
your
fingers
when
they
shake
hands
with
you
.
God
,
I
hate
that
stuff
.
``
Are
you
all
alone
,
baby
?
''
old
Lillian
asked
me
.
She
was
blocking
up
the
whole
goddam
traffic
in
the
aisle
.
You
could
tell
she
liked
to
block
up
a
lot
of
traffic
.
This
waiter
was
waiting
for
her
to
move
out
of
the
way
,
but
she
did
n't
even
notice
him
.
It
was
funny
.
You
could
tell
the
waiter
did
n't
like
her
much
,
you
could
tell
even
the
Navy
guy
did
n't
like
her
much
,
even
though
he
was
dating
her
.
And
I
did
n't
like
her
much
.
Nobody
did
.
You
had
to
feel
sort
of
sorry
for
her
,
in
a
way
.
``
Do
n't
you
have
a
date
,
baby
?
''
she
asked
me
.
I
was
standing
up
now
,
and
she
did
n't
even
tell
me
to
sit
down
.
She
was
the
type
that
keeps
you
standing
up
for
hours
.
``
Is
n't
he
handsome
?
''
she
said
to
the
Navy
guy
.
``
Holden
,
you
're
getting
handsomer
by
the
minute
.
''
The
Navy
guy
told
her
to
come
on
.
He
told
her
they
were
blocking
up
the
whole
aisle
.
``
Holden
,
come
join
us
,
''
old
Lillian
said
.
``
Bring
your
drink
.
''
``
I
was
just
leaving
,
''
I
told
her
.
``
I
have
to
meet
somebody
.
''
You
could
tell
she
was
just
trying
to
get
in
good
with
me
.
So
that
I
'd
tell
old
D.B
.
about
it
.
``
Well
,
you
little
so-and-so
.
All
right
for
you
.
Tell
your
big
brother
I
hate
him
,
when
you
see
him
.
''
Then
she
left
.
The
Navy
guy
and
I
told
each
other
we
were
glad
to
've
met
each
other
.
Which
always
kills
me
.
I
'm
always
saying
``
Glad
to
've
met
you
''
to
somebody
I
'm
not
at
all
glad
I
met
.
If
you
want
to
stay
alive
,
you
have
to
say
that
stuff
,
though
.
After
I
'd
told
her
I
had
to
meet
somebody
,
I
did
n't
have
any
goddam
choice
except
to
leave
.
I
could
n't
even
stick
around
to
hear
old
Ernie
play
something
halfway
decent
.
But
I
certainly
was
n't
going
to
sit
down
at
a
table
with
old
Lillian
Simmons
and
that
Navy
guy
and
be
bored
to
death
.
So
I
left
.
It
made
me
mad
,
though
,
when
I
was
getting
my
coat
.
People
are
always
ruining
things
for
you
.
13
I
walked
all
the
way
back
to
the
hotel
.
Forty-one
gorgeous
blocks
.
I
did
n't
do
it
because
I
felt
like
walking
or
anything
.
It
was
more
because
I
did
n't
feel
like
getting
in
and
out
of
another
taxicab
.
Sometimes
you
get
tired
of
riding
in
taxicabs
the
same
way
you
get
tired
riding
in
elevators
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
you
have
to
walk
,
no
matter
how
far
or
how
high
up
.
When
I
was
a
kid
,
I
used
to
walk
all
the
way
up
to
our
apartment
very
frequently
.
Twelve
stories
.
You
would
n't
even
have
known
it
had
snowed
at
all
.
There
was
hardly
any
snow
on
the
sidewalks
.
But
it
was
freezing
cold
,
and
I
took
my
red
hunting
hat
out
of
my
pocket
and
put
it
on
--
I
did
n't
give
a
damn
how
I
looked
.
I
even
put
the
earlaps
down
.
I
wished
I
knew
who
'd
swiped
my
gloves
at
Pencey
,
because
my
hands
were
freezing
.
Not
that
I
'd
have
done
much
about
it
even
if
I
had
known
.
I
'm
one
of
these
very
yellow
guys
.
I
try
not
to
show
it
,
but
I
am
.
For
instance
,
if
I
'd
found
out
at
Pencey
who
'd
stolen
my
gloves
,
I
probably
would
've
gone
down
to
the
crook
's
room
and
said
,
``
Okay
.
How
'bout
handing
over
those
gloves
?
''
Then
the
crook
that
had
stolen
them
probably
would
've
said
,
his
voice
very
innocent
and
all
,
``
What
gloves
?
''
Then
what
I
probably
would
've
done
,
I
'd
have
gone
in
his
closet
and
found
the
gloves
somewhere
.
Hidden
in
his
goddam
galoshes
or
something
,
for
instance
.
I
'd
have
taken
them
out
and
showed
them
to
the
guy
and
said
,
``
I
suppose
these
are
your
goddam
gloves
?
''
Then
the
crook
probably
would
've
given
me
this
very
phony
,
innocent
look
,
and
said
,
``
I
never
saw
those
gloves
before
in
my
life
.
If
they
're
yours
,
take
'em
.
I
do
n't
want
the
goddam
things
.
''
Then
I
probably
would
've
just
stood
there
for
about
five
minutes
.
I
'd
have
the
damn
gloves
right
in
my
hand
and
all
,
but
I
'd
feel
I
ought
to
sock
the
guy
in
the
jaw
or
something
--
break
his
goddam
jaw
.
Only
,
I
would
n't
have
the
guts
to
do
it
.
I
'd
just
stand
there
,
trying
to
look
tough
.
What
I
might
do
,
I
might
say
something
very
cutting
and
snotty
,
to
rile
him
up
--
instead
of
socking
him
in
the
jaw
.
Anyway
if
I
did
say
something
very
cutting
and
snotty
,
he
'd
probably
get
up
and
come
over
to
me
and
say
,
``
Listen
,
Caulfield
.
Are
you
calling
me
a
crook
?
''
Then
,
instead
of
saying
,
``
You
're
goddam
right
I
am
,
you
dirty
crooked
bastard
!
''
all
I
probably
would
've
said
would
be
,
``
All
I
know
is
my
goddam
gloves
were
in
your
goddam
galoshes
.
''
Right
away
then
,
the
guy
would
know
for
sure
that
I
was
n't
going
to
take
a
sock
at
him
,
and
he
probably
would
've
said
,
``
Listen
.
Let
's
get
this
straight
.
Are
you
calling
me
a
thief
?
''
Then
I
probably
would
've
said
,
``
Nobody
's
calling
anybody
a
thief
.
All
I
know
is
my
gloves
were
in
your
goddam
galoshes
.
''
It
could
go
on
like
that
for
hours
.
Finally
,
though
,
I
'd
leave
his
room
without
even
taking
a
sock
at
him
.
I
'd
probably
go
down
to
the
can
and
sneak
a
cigarette
and
watch
myself
getting
tough
in
the
mirror
.
Anyway
,
that
's
what
I
thought
about
the
whole
way
back
to
the
hotel
.
It
's
no
fun
to
he
yellow
.
Maybe
I
'm
not
all
yellow
.
I
do
n't
know
.
I
think
maybe
I
'm
just
partly
yellow
and
partly
the
type
that
does
n't
give
much
of
a
damn
if
they
lose
their
gloves
.
One
of
my
troubles
is
,
I
never
care
too
much
when
I
lose
something
--
it
used
to
drive
my
mother
crazy
when
I
was
a
kid
.
Some
guys
spend
days
looking
for
something
they
lost
.
I
never
seem
to
have
anything
that
if
I
lost
it
I
'd
care
too
much
.
Maybe
that
's
why
I
'm
partly
yellow
.
It
's
no
excuse
,
though
.
It
really
is
n't
.
What
you
should
be
is
not
yellow
at
all
.
If
you
're
supposed
to
sock
somebody
in
the
jaw
,
and
you
sort
of
feel
like
doing
it
,
you
should
do
it
.
I
'm
just
no
good
at
it
,
though
.
I
'd
rather
push
a
guy
out
the
window
or
chop
his
head
off
with
an
ax
than
sock
him
in
the
jaw
.
I
hate
fist
fights
.
I
do
n't
mind
getting
hit
so
much
--
although
I
'm
not
crazy
about
it
,
naturally
--
but
what
scares
me
most
in
a
fist
fight
is
the
guy
's
face
.
I
ca
n't
stand
looking
at
the
other
guy
's
face
,
is
my
trouble
.
It
would
n't
be
so
bad
if
you
could
both
be
blindfolded
or
something
.
It
's
a
funny
kind
of
yellowness
,
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
,
but
it
's
yellowness
,
all
right
.
I
'm
not
kidding
myself
.
The
more
I
thought
about
my
gloves
and
my
yellowness
,
the
more
depressed
I
got
,
and
I
decided
,
while
I
was
walking
and
all
,
to
stop
off
and
have
a
drink
somewhere
.
I
'd
only
had
three
drinks
at
Ernie
's
,
and
I
did
n't
even
finish
the
last
one
.
One
thing
I
have
,
it
's
a
terrific
capacity
.
I
can
drink
all
night
and
not
even
show
it
,
if
I
'm
in
the
mood
.
Once
,
at
the
Whooton
School
,
this
other
boy
,
Raymond
Goldfarb
,
and
I
bought
a
pint
of
Scotch
and
drank
it
in
the
chapel
one
Saturday
night
,
where
nobody
'd
see
us
.
He
got
stinking
,
but
I
hardly
did
n't
even
show
it
.
I
just
got
very
cool
and
nonchalant
.
I
puked
before
I
went
to
bed
,
but
I
did
n't
really
have
to
--
I
forced
myself
.
Anyway
,
before
I
got
to
the
hotel
,
I
started
to
go
in
this
dumpy-looking
bar
,
but
two
guys
came
out
,
drunk
as
hell
,
and
wanted
to
know
where
the
subway
was
.
One
of
them
was
this
very
Cuban-looking
guy
,
and
he
kept
breathing
his
stinking
breath
in
my
face
while
I
gave
him
directions
.
I
ended
up
not
even
going
in
the
damn
bar
.
I
just
went
back
to
the
hotel
.
The
whole
lobby
was
empty
.
It
smelled
like
fifty
million
dead
cigars
.
It
really
did
.
I
was
n't
sleepy
or
anything
,
but
I
was
feeling
sort
of
lousy
.
Depressed
and
all
.
I
almost
wished
I
was
dead
.
Then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
I
got
in
this
big
mess
.
The
first
thing
when
I
got
in
the
elevator
,
the
elevator
guy
said
to
me
,
``
Innarested
in
having
a
good
time
,
fella
?
Or
is
it
too
late
for
you
?
''
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
I
said
.
I
did
n't
know
what
he
was
driving
at
or
anything
.
``
Innarested
in
a
little
tail
t'night
?
''
``
Me
?
''
I
said
.
Which
was
a
very
dumb
answer
,
but
it
's
quite
embarrassing
when
somebody
comes
right
up
and
asks
you
a
question
like
that
.
``
How
old
are
you
,
chief
?
''
the
elevator
guy
said
.
``
Why
?
''
I
said
.
``
Twenty-two
.
''
``
Uh
huh
.
Well
,
how
'bout
it
?
Y'innarested
?
Five
bucks
a
throw
.
Fifteen
bucks
the
whole
night
.
''
He
looked
at
his
wrist
watch
.
``
Till
noon
.
Five
bucks
a
throw
,
fifteen
bucks
till
noon
.
''
``
Okay
,
''
I
said
.
It
was
against
my
principles
and
all
,
but
I
was
feeling
so
depressed
I
did
n't
even
think
.
That
's
the
whole
trouble
.
When
you
're
feeling
very
depressed
,
you
ca
n't
even
think
.
``
Okay
what
?
A
throw
,
or
till
noon
?
I
got
ta
know
.
''
``
Just
a
throw
.
''
``
Okay
,
what
room
ya
in
?
''
I
looked
at
the
red
thing
with
my
number
on
it
,
on
my
key
.
``
Twelve
twenty-two
,
''
I
said
.
I
was
already
sort
of
sorry
I
'd
let
the
thing
start
rolling
,
but
it
was
too
late
now
.
``
Okay
.
I
'll
send
a
girl
up
in
about
fifteen
minutes
.
''
He
opened
the
doors
and
I
got
out
.
``
Hey
,
is
she
good-looking
?
''
I
asked
him
.
``
I
do
n't
want
any
old
bag
.
''
``
No
old
bag
.
Do
n't
worry
about
it
,
chief
.
''
``
Who
do
I
pay
?
''
``
Her
,
''
he
said
.
``
Let
's
go
,
chief
.
''
He
shut
the
doors
,
practically
right
in
my
face
.
I
went
to
my
room
and
put
some
water
on
my
hair
,
but
you
ca
n't
really
comb
a
crew
cut
or
anything
.
Then
I
tested
to
see
if
my
breath
stank
from
so
many
cigarettes
and
the
Scotch
and
sodas
I
drank
at
Ernie
's
.
All
you
do
is
hold
your
hand
under
your
mouth
and
blow
your
breath
up
toward
the
old
nostrils
.
It
did
n't
seem
to
stink
much
,
but
I
brushed
my
teeth
anyway
.
Then
I
put
on
another
clean
shirt
.
I
knew
I
did
n't
have
to
get
all
dolled
up
for
a
prostitute
or
anything
,
but
it
sort
of
gave
me
something
to
do
.
I
was
a
little
nervous
.
I
was
starting
to
feel
pretty
sexy
and
all
,
but
I
was
a
little
nervous
anyway
.
If
you
want
to
know
the
truth
,
I
'm
a
virgin
.
I
really
am
.
I
've
had
quite
a
few
opportunities
to
lose
my
virginity
and
all
,
but
I
've
never
got
around
to
it
yet
.
Something
always
happens
.
For
instance
,
if
you
're
at
a
girl
's
house
,
her
parents
always
come
home
at
the
wrong
time
--
or
you
're
afraid
they
will
.
Or
if
you
're
in
the
back
seat
of
somebody
's
car
,
there
's
always
somebody
's
date
in
the
front
seat
--
some
girl
,
I
mean
--
that
always
wants
to
know
what
's
going
on
all
over
the
whole
goddam
car
.
I
mean
some
girl
in
front
keeps
turning
around
to
see
what
the
hell
's
going
on
.
Anyway
,
something
always
happens
.
I
came
quite
close
to
doing
it
a
couple
of
times
,
though
.
One
time
in
particular
,
I
remember
.
Something
went
wrong
,
though
--
I
do
n't
even
remember
what
any
more
.
The
thing
is
,
most
of
the
time
when
you
're
coming
pretty
close
to
doing
it
with
a
girl
--
a
girl
that
is
n't
a
prostitute
or
anything
,
I
mean
--
she
keeps
telling
you
to
stop
.
The
trouble
with
me
is
,
I
stop
.
Most
guys
do
n't
.
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
You
never
know
whether
they
really
want
you
to
stop
,
or
whether
they
're
just
scared
as
hell
,
or
whether
they
're
just
telling
you
to
stop
so
that
if
you
do
go
through
with
it
,
the
blame
'll
be
on
you
,
not
them
.
Anyway
,
I
keep
stopping
.
The
trouble
is
,
I
get
to
feeling
sorry
for
them
.
I
mean
most
girls
are
so
dumb
and
all
.
After
you
neck
them
for
a
while
,
you
can
really
watch
them
losing
their
brains
.
You
take
a
girl
when
she
really
gets
passionate
,
she
just
has
n't
any
brains
.
I
do
n't
know
.
They
tell
me
to
stop
,
so
I
stop
.
I
always
wish
I
had
n't
,
after
I
take
them
home
,
but
I
keep
doing
it
anyway
.
Anyway
,
while
I
was
putting
on
another
clean
shirt
,
I
sort
of
figured
this
was
my
big
chance
,
in
a
way
.
I
figured
if
she
was
a
prostitute
and
all
,
I
could
get
in
some
practice
on
her
,
in
case
I
ever
get
married
or
anything
.
I
worry
about
that
stuff
sometimes
.
I
read
this
book
once
,
at
the
Whooton
School
,
that
had
this
very
sophisticated
,
suave
,
sexy
guy
in
it
.
Monsieur
Blanchard
was
his
name
,
I
can
still
remember
.
It
was
a
lousy
book
,
but
this
Blanchard
guy
was
pretty
good
.
He
had
this
big
château
and
all
on
the
Riviera
,
in
Europe
,
and
all
he
did
in
his
spare
time
was
beat
women
off
with
a
club
.
He
was
a
real
rake
and
all
,
but
he
knocked
women
out
.
He
said
,
in
this
one
part
,
that
a
woman
's
body
is
like
a
violin
and
all
,
and
that
it
takes
a
terrific
musician
to
play
it
right
.
It
was
a
very
corny
book
--
I
realize
that
--
but
I
could
n't
get
that
violin
stuff
out
of
my
mind
anyway
.
In
a
way
,
that
's
why
I
sort
of
wanted
to
get
some
practice
in
,
in
case
I
ever
get
married
.
Caulfield
and
his
Magic
Violin
,
boy
.
It
's
corny
,
I
realize
,
but
it
is
n't
too
corny
.
I
would
n't
mind
being
pretty
good
at
that
stuff
.
Half
the
time
,
if
you
really
want
to
know
the
truth
,
when
I
'm
horsing
around
with
a
girl
,
I
have
a
helluva
lot
of
trouble
just
finding
what
I
'm
looking
for
,
for
God
's
sake
,
if
you
know
what
I
mean
.
Take
this
girl
that
I
just
missed
having
sexual
intercourse
with
,
that
I
told
you
about
.
It
took
me
about
an
hour
to
just
get
her
goddam
brassiere
off
.
By
the
time
I
did
get
it
off
,
she
was
about
ready
to
spit
in
my
eye
.
Anyway
,
I
kept
walking
around
the
room
,
waiting
for
this
prostitute
to
show
up
.
I
kept
hoping
she
'd
be
good-looking
.
I
did
n't
care
too
much
,
though
.
I
sort
of
just
wanted
to
get
it
over
with
.
Finally
,
somebody
knocked
on
the
door
,
and
when
I
went
to
open
it
,
I
had
my
suitcase
right
in
the
way
and
I
fell
over
it
and
damn
near
broke
my
knee
.
I
always
pick
a
gorgeous
time
to
fall
over
a
suitcase
or
something
.
When
I
opened
the
door
,
this
prostitute
was
standing
there
.
She
had
a
polo
coat
on
,
and
no
hat
.
She
was
sort
of
a
blonde
,
but
you
could
tell
she
dyed
her
hair
.
She
was
n't
any
old
bag
,
though
.
``
How
do
you
do
,
''
I
said
.
Suave
as
hell
,
boy
.
``
You
the
guy
Maurice
said
?
''
she
asked
me
.
She
did
n't
seem
too
goddam
friendly
.
``
Is
he
the
elevator
boy
?
''
``
Yeah
,
''
she
said
.
``
Yes
,
I
am
.
Come
in
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
I
said
.
I
was
getting
more
and
more
nonchalant
as
it
went
along
.
I
really
was
.
She
came
in
and
took
her
coat
off
right
away
and
sort
of
chucked
it
on
the
bed
.
She
had
on
a
green
dress
underneath
.
Then
she
sort
of
sat
down
sideways
on
the
chair
that
went
with
the
desk
in
the
room
and
started
jiggling
her
foot
up
and
down
.
She
crossed
her
legs
and
started
jiggling
this
one
foot
up
and
down
.
She
was
very
nervous
,
for
a
prostitute
.
She
really
was
.
I
think
it
was
because
she
was
young
as
hell
.
She
was
around
my
age
.
I
sat
down
in
the
big
chair
,
next
to
her
,
and
offered
her
a
cigarette
.
``
I
do
n't
smoke
,
''
she
said
.
She
had
a
tiny
little
wheeny-whiny
voice
.
You
could
hardly
hear
her
.
She
never
said
thank
you
,
either
,
when
you
offered
her
something
.
She
just
did
n't
know
any
better
.
``
Allow
me
to
introduce
myself
.
My
name
is
Jim
Steele
,
''
I
said
.
``
Ya
got
a
watch
on
ya
?
''
she
said
.
She
did
n't
care
what
the
hell
my
name
was
,
naturally
.
``
Hey
,
how
old
are
you
,
anyways
?
''
``
Me
?
Twenty-two
.
''
``
Like
fun
you
are
.
''
It
was
a
funny
thing
to
say
.
It
sounded
like
a
real
kid
.
You
'd
think
a
prostitute
and
all
would
say
``
Like
hell
you
are
''
or
``
Cut
the
crap
''
instead
of
``
Like
fun
you
are
.
''
``
How
old
are
you
?
''
I
asked
her
.
``
Old
enough
to
know
better
,
''
she
said
.
She
was
really
witty
.
``
Ya
got
a
watch
on
ya
?
''
she
asked
me
again
,
and
then
she
stood
up
and
pulled
her
dress
over
her
head
.
I
certainly
felt
peculiar
when
she
did
that
.
I
mean
she
did
it
so
sudden
and
all
.
I
know
you
're
supposed
to
feel
pretty
sexy
when
somebody
gets
up
and
pulls
their
dress
over
their
head
,
but
I
did
n't
.
Sexy
was
about
the
last
thing
I
was
feeling
.
I
felt
much
more
depressed
than
sexy
.
``
Ya
got
a
watch
on
ya
,
hey
?
''
``
No
.
No
,
I
do
n't
,
''
I
said
.
Boy
,
was
I
feeling
peculiar
.
``
What
's
your
name
?
''
I
asked
her
.
All
she
had
on
was
this
pink
slip
.
It
was
really
quite
embarrassing
.
It
really
was
.
``
Sunny
,
''
she
said
.
``
Let
's
go
,
hey
.
''
``
Do
n't
you
feel
like
talking
for
a
while
?
''
I
asked
her
.
It
was
a
childish
thing
to
say
,
but
I
was
feeling
so
damn
peculiar
.
``
Are
you
in
a
very
big
hurry
?
''
She
looked
at
me
like
I
was
a
madman
.
``
What
the
heck
ya
wan
na
talk
about
?
''
she
said
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Nothing
special
.
I
just
thought
perhaps
you
might
care
to
chat
for
a
while
.
''
She
sat
down
in
the
chair
next
to
the
desk
again
.
She
did
n't
like
it
,
though
,
you
could
tell
.
She
started
jiggling
her
foot
again
--
boy
,
she
was
a
nervous
girl
.
``
Would
you
care
for
a
cigarette
now
?
''
I
said
.
I
forgot
she
did
n't
smoke
.
``
I
do
n't
smoke
.
Listen
,
if
you
're
gon
na
talk
,
do
it
.
I
got
things
to
do
.
''
I
could
n't
think
of
anything
to
talk
about
,
though
.
I
thought
of
asking
her
how
she
got
to
be
a
prostitute
and
all
,
but
I
was
scared
to
ask
her
.
She
probably
wouldn't
've
told
me
anyway
.
``
You
do
n't
come
from
New
York
,
do
you
?
''
I
said
finally
.
That
's
all
I
could
think
of
.
``
Hollywood
,
''
she
said
.
Then
she
got
up
and
went
over
to
where
she
'd
put
her
dress
down
,
on
the
bed
.
``
Ya
got
a
hanger
?
I
do
n't
want
to
get
my
dress
all
wrinkly
.
It
's
brand-clean
.
''
``
Sure
,
''
I
said
right
away
.
I
was
only
too
glad
to
get
up
and
do
something
.
I
took
her
dress
over
to
the
closet
and
hung
it
up
for
her
.
It
was
funny
.
It
made
me
feel
sort
of
sad
when
I
hung
it
up
.
I
thought
of
her
going
in
a
store
and
buying
it
,
and
nobody
in
the
store
knowing
she
was
a
prostitute
and
all
.
The
salesman
probably
just
thought
she
was
a
regular
girl
when
she
bought
it
.
It
made
me
feel
sad
as
hell
--
I
do
n't
know
why
exactly
.
I
sat
down
again
and
tried
to
keep
the
old
conversation
going
.
She
was
a
lousy
conversationalist
.
``
Do
you
work
every
night
?
''
I
asked
her
--
it
sounded
sort
of
awful
,
after
I
'd
said
it
.
``
Yeah
.
''
She
was
walking
all
around
the
room
.
She
picked
up
the
menu
off
the
desk
and
read
it
.
``
What
do
you
do
during
the
day
?
''
She
sort
of
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
She
was
pretty
skinny
.
``
Sleep
.
Go
to
the
show
.
''
She
put
down
the
menu
and
looked
at
me
.
``
Let
's
go
,
hey
.
I
have
n't
got
all
--
''
``
Look
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
do
n't
feel
very
much
like
myself
tonight
.
I
've
had
a
rough
night
.
Honest
to
God
.
I
'll
pay
you
and
all
,
but
do
you
mind
very
much
if
we
do
n't
do
it
?
Do
you
mind
very
much
?
''
The
trouble
was
,
I
just
did
n't
want
to
do
it
.
I
felt
more
depressed
than
sexy
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
She
was
depressing
.
Her
green
dress
hanging
in
the
closet
and
all
.
And
besides
,
I
do
n't
think
I
could
ever
do
it
with
somebody
that
sits
in
a
stupid
movie
all
day
long
.
I
really
do
n't
think
I
could
.
She
came
over
to
me
,
with
this
funny
look
on
her
face
,
like
as
if
she
did
n't
believe
me
.
``
What'sa
matter
?
''
she
said
.
``
Nothing
's
the
matter
.
''
Boy
,
was
I
getting
nervous
.
``
The
thing
is
,
I
had
an
operation
very
recently
.
''
``
Yeah
?
Where
?
''
``
On
my
wuddayacallit
--
my
clavichord
.
''
``
Yeah
?
Where
the
hell
's
that
?
''
``
The
clavichord
?
''
I
said
.
``
Well
,
actually
,
it
's
in
the
spinal
canal
.
I
mean
it
's
quite
a
ways
down
in
the
spinal
canal
.
''
``
Yeah
?
''
she
said
.
``
That
's
tough
.
''
Then
she
sat
down
on
my
goddam
lap
.
``
You
're
cute
.
''
She
made
me
so
nervous
,
I
just
kept
on
lying
my
head
off
.
``
I
'm
still
recuperating
,
''
I
told
her
.
``
You
look
like
a
guy
in
the
movies
.
You
know
.
Whosis
.
You
know
who
I
mean
.
What
the
heck
's
his
name
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
I
said
.
She
would
n't
get
off
my
goddam
lap
.
``
Sure
you
know
.
He
was
in
that
pitcher
with
Mel-vine
Douglas
?
The
one
that
was
Mel-vine
Douglas
's
kid
brother
?
That
falls
off
this
boat
?
You
know
who
I
mean
.
''
``
No
,
I
do
n't
.
I
go
to
the
movies
as
seldom
as
I
can
.
''
Then
she
started
getting
funny
.
Crude
and
all
.
``
Do
you
mind
cutting
it
out
?
''
I
said
.
``
I
'm
not
in
the
mood
,
I
just
told
you
.
I
just
had
an
operation
.
''
She
did
n't
get
up
from
my
lap
or
anything
,
but
she
gave
me
this
terrifically
dirty
look
.
``
Listen
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
was
sleepin
'
when
that
crazy
Maurice
woke
me
up
.
If
you
think
I
'm
--
''
``
I
said
I
'd
pay
you
for
coming
and
all
.
I
really
will
.
I
have
plenty
of
dough
.
It
's
just
that
I
'm
practically
just
recovering
from
a
very
serious
--
''
``
What
the
heck
did
you
tell
that
crazy
Maurice
you
wanted
a
girl
for
,
then
?
If
you
just
had
a
goddam
operation
on
your
goddam
wuddayacallit
.
Huh
?
''
``
I
thought
I
'd
be
feeling
a
lot
better
than
I
do
.
I
was
a
little
premature
in
my
calculations
.
No
kidding
.
I
'm
sorry
.
If
you
'll
just
get
up
a
second
,
I
'll
get
my
wallet
.
I
mean
it
.
''
She
was
sore
as
hell
,
but
she
got
up
off
my
goddam
lap
so
that
I
could
go
over
and
get
my
wallet
off
the
chiffonier
.
I
took
out
a
five-dollar
bill
and
handed
it
to
her
.
``
Thanks
a
lot
,
''
I
told
her
.
``
Thanks
a
million
.
''
``
This
is
a
five
.
It
costs
ten
.
''
She
was
getting
funny
,
you
could
tell
.
I
was
afraid
something
like
that
would
happen
--
I
really
was
.
``
Maurice
said
five
,
''
I
told
her
.
``
He
said
fifteen
till
noon
and
only
five
for
a
throw
.
''
``
Ten
for
a
throw
.
''
``
He
said
five
.
I
'm
sorry
--
I
really
am
--
but
that
's
all
I
'm
gon
na
shell
out
.
''
She
sort
of
shrugged
her
shoulders
,
the
way
she
did
before
,
and
then
she
said
,
very
cold
,
``
Do
you
mind
getting
me
my
frock
?
Or
would
it
be
too
much
trouble
?
''
She
was
a
pretty
spooky
kid
.
Even
with
that
little
bitty
voice
she
had
,
she
could
sort
of
scare
you
a
little
bit
.
If
she
'd
been
a
big
old
prostitute
,
with
a
lot
of
makeup
on
her
face
and
all
,
she
would
n't
have
been
half
as
spooky
.
I
went
and
got
her
dress
for
her
.
She
put
it
on
and
all
,
and
then
she
picked
up
her
polo
coat
off
the
bed
.
``
So
long
,
crumb-bum
,
''
she
said
.
``
So
long
,
''
I
said
.
I
did
n't
thank
her
or
anything
.
I
'm
glad
I
did
n't
.
14
After
Old
Sunny
was
gone
,
I
sat
in
the
chair
for
a
while
and
smoked
a
couple
of
cigarettes
.
It
was
getting
daylight
outside
.
Boy
,
I
felt
miserable
.
I
felt
so
depressed
,
you
ca
n't
imagine
.
What
I
did
,
I
started
talking
,
sort
of
out
loud
,
to
Allie
.
I
do
that
sometimes
when
I
get
very
depressed
.
I
keep
telling
him
to
go
home
and
get
his
bike
and
meet
me
in
front
of
Bobby
Fallon
's
house
.
Bobby
Fallon
used
to
live
quite
near
us
in
Maine
--
this
is
,
years
ago
.
Anyway
,
what
happened
was
,
one
day
Bobby
and
I
were
going
over
to
Lake
Sedebego
on
our
bikes
.
We
were
going
to
take
our
lunches
and
all
,
and
our
BB
guns
--
we
were
kids
and
all
,
and
we
thought
we
could
shoot
something
with
our
BB
guns
.
Anyway
,
Allie
heard
us
talking
about
it
,
and
he
wanted
to
go
,
and
I
would
n't
let
him
.
I
told
him
he
was
a
child
.
So
once
in
a
while
,
now
,
when
I
get
very
depressed
,
I
keep
saying
to
him
,
``
Okay
.
Go
home
and
get
your
bike
and
meet
me
in
front
of
Bobby
's
house
.
Hurry
up
.
''
It
was
n't
that
I
did
n't
use
to
take
him
with
me
when
I
went
somewhere
.
I
did
.
But
that
one
day
,
I
did
n't
.
He
did
n't
get
sore
about
it
--
he
never
got
sore
about
anything
--
but
I
keep
thinking
about
it
anyway
,
when
I
get
very
depressed
.
Finally
,
though
,
I
got
undressed
and
got
in
bed
.
I
felt
like
praying
or
something
,
when
I
was
in
bed
,
but
I
could
n't
do
it
.
I
ca
n't
always
pray
when
I
feel
like
it
.
In
the
first
place
,
I
'm
sort
of
an
atheist
.
I
like
Jesus
and
all
,
but
I
do
n't
care
too
much
for
most
of
the
other
stuff
in
the
Bible
.
Take
the
Disciples
,
for
instance
.
They
annoy
the
hell
out
of
me
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
They
were
all
right
after
Jesus
was
dead
and
all
,
but
while
He
was
alive
,
they
were
about
as
much
use
to
Him
as
a
hole
in
the
head
.
All
they
did
was
keep
letting
Him
down
.
I
like
almost
anybody
in
the
Bible
better
than
the
Disciples
.
If
you
want
to
know
the
truth
,
the
guy
I
like
best
in
the
Bible
,
next
to
Jesus
,
was
that
lunatic
and
all
,
that
lived
in
the
tombs
and
kept
cutting
himself
with
stones
.
I
like
him
ten
times
as
much
as
the
Disciples
,
that
poor
bastard
.
I
used
to
get
in
quite
a
few
arguments
about
it
,
when
I
was
at
Whooton
School
,
with
this
boy
that
lived
down
the
corridor
,
Arthur
Childs
.
Old
Childs
was
a
Quaker
and
all
,
and
he
read
the
Bible
all
the
time
.
He
was
a
very
nice
kid
,
and
I
liked
him
,
but
I
could
never
see
eye
to
eye
with
him
on
a
lot
of
stuff
in
the
Bible
,
especially
the
Disciples
.
He
kept
telling
me
if
I
did
n't
like
the
Disciples
,
then
I
did
n't
like
Jesus
and
all
.
He
said
that
because
Jesus
picked
the
Disciples
,
you
were
supposed
to
like
them
.
I
said
I
knew
He
picked
them
,
but
that
He
picked
them
at
random
.
I
said
He
did
n't
have
time
to
go
around
analyzing
everybody
.
I
said
I
was
n't
blaming
Jesus
or
anything
.
It
was
n't
His
fault
that
He
did
n't
have
any
time
.
I
remember
I
asked
old
Childs
if
he
thought
Judas
,
the
one
that
betrayed
Jesus
and
all
,
went
to
Hell
after
he
committed
suicide
.
Childs
said
certainly
.
That
's
exactly
where
I
disagreed
with
him
.
I
said
I
'd
bet
a
thousand
bucks
that
Jesus
never
sent
old
Judas
to
Hell
.
I
still
would
,
too
,
if
I
had
a
thousand
bucks
.
I
think
any
one
of
the
Disciples
would
've
sent
him
to
Hell
and
all
--
and
fast
,
too
--
but
I
'll
bet
anything
Jesus
did
n't
do
it
.
Old
Childs
said
the
trouble
with
me
was
that
I
did
n't
go
to
church
or
anything
.
He
was
right
about
that
,
in
a
way
.
I
do
n't
.
In
the
first
place
,
my
parents
are
different
religions
,
and
all
the
children
in
our
family
are
atheists
.
If
you
want
to
know
the
truth
,
I
ca
n't
even
stand
ministers
.
The
ones
they
've
had
at
every
school
I
've
gone
to
,
they
all
have
these
Holy
Joe
voices
when
they
start
giving
their
sermons
.
God
,
I
hate
that
.
I
do
n't
see
why
the
hell
they
ca
n't
talk
in
their
natural
voice
.
They
sound
so
phony
when
they
talk
.
Anyway
,
when
I
was
in
bed
,
I
could
n't
pray
worth
a
damn
.
Every
time
I
got
started
,
I
kept
picturing
old
Sunny
calling
me
a
crumb-bum
.
Finally
,
I
sat
up
in
bed
and
smoked
another
cigarette
.
It
tasted
lousy
.
I
must
've
smoked
around
two
packs
since
I
left
Pencey
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
while
I
was
laying
there
smoking
,
somebody
knocked
on
the
door
.
I
kept
hoping
it
was
n't
my
door
they
were
knocking
on
,
but
I
knew
damn
well
it
was
.
I
do
n't
know
how
I
knew
,
but
I
knew
.
I
knew
who
it
was
,
too
.
I
'm
psychic
.
``
Who
's
there
?
''
I
said
.
I
was
pretty
scared
.
I
'm
very
yellow
about
those
things
.
They
just
knocked
again
,
though
.
Louder
.
Finally
I
got
out
of
bed
,
with
just
my
pajamas
on
,
and
opened
the
door
.
I
did
n't
even
have
to
turn
the
light
on
in
the
room
,
because
it
was
already
daylight
.
Old
Sunny
and
Maurice
,
the
pimpy
elevator
guy
,
were
standing
there
.
``
What
's
the
matter
?
Wuddaya
want
?
''
I
said
.
Boy
,
my
voice
was
shaking
like
hell
.
``
Nothin
'
much
,
''
old
Maurice
said
.
``
Just
five
bucks
.
''
He
did
all
the
talking
for
the
two
of
them
.
Old
Sunny
just
stood
there
next
to
him
,
with
her
mouth
open
and
all
.
``
I
paid
her
already
.
I
gave
her
five
bucks
.
Ask
her
,
''
I
said
.
Boy
,
was
my
voice
shaking
.
``
It
's
ten
bucks
,
chief
.
I
tole
ya
that
.
Ten
bucks
for
a
throw
,
fifteen
bucks
till
noon
.
I
tole
ya
that
.
''
``
You
did
not
tell
me
that
.
You
said
five
bucks
a
throw
.
You
said
fifteen
bucks
till
noon
,
all
right
,
but
I
distinctly
heard
you
--
''
``
Open
up
,
chief
.
''
``
What
for
?
''
I
said
.
God
,
my
old
heart
was
damn
near
beating
me
out
of
the
room
.
I
wished
I
was
dressed
at
least
.
It
's
terrible
to
be
just
in
your
pajamas
when
something
like
that
happens
.
``
Let
's
go
,
chief
,
''
old
Maurice
said
.
Then
he
gave
me
a
big
shove
with
his
crumby
hand
.
I
damn
near
fell
over
on
my
can
--
he
was
a
huge
sonuvabitch
.
The
next
thing
I
knew
,
he
and
old
Sunny
were
both
in
the
room
.
They
acted
like
they
owned
the
damn
place
.
Old
Sunny
sat
down
on
the
window
sill
.
Old
Maurice
sat
down
in
the
big
chair
and
loosened
his
collar
and
all
--
he
was
wearing
this
elevator
operator
's
uniform
.
Boy
,
was
I
nervous
.
``
All
right
,
chief
,
let
's
have
it
.
I
got
ta
get
back
to
work
.
''
``
I
told
you
about
ten
times
,
I
do
n't
owe
you
a
cent
.
I
already
gave
her
the
five
--
''
``
Cut
the
crap
,
now
.
Let
's
have
it
.
''
``
Why
should
I
give
her
another
five
bucks
?
''
I
said
.
My
voice
was
cracking
all
over
the
place
.
``
You
're
trying
to
chisel
me
.
''
Old
Maurice
unbuttoned
his
whole
uniform
coat
.
All
he
had
on
underneath
was
a
phony
shirt
collar
,
but
no
shirt
or
anything
.
He
had
a
big
fat
hairy
stomach
.
``
Nobody
's
tryna
chisel
nobody
,
''
he
said
.
``
Let
's
have
it
,
chief
.
''
``
No
.
''
When
I
said
that
,
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
started
walking
towards
me
and
all
.
He
looked
like
he
was
very
,
very
tired
or
very
,
very
bored
.
God
,
was
I
scared
.
I
sort
of
had
my
arms
folded
,
I
remember
.
It
would
n't
have
been
so
bad
,
I
do
n't
think
,
if
I
had
n't
had
just
my
goddam
pajamas
on
.
``
Let
's
have
it
,
chief
.
''
He
came
right
up
to
where
I
was
standing
.
That
's
all
he
could
say
.
``
Let
's
have
it
,
chief
.
''
He
was
a
real
moron
.
``
No
.
''
``
Chief
,
you
're
gon
na
force
me
inna
roughin
'
ya
up
a
little
bit
.
I
do
n't
wan
na
do
it
,
but
that
's
the
way
it
looks
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
owe
us
five
bucks
.
''
``
I
do
n't
owe
you
five
bucks
,
''
I
said
.
``
If
you
rough
me
up
,
I
'll
yell
like
hell
.
I
'll
wake
up
everybody
in
the
hotel
.
The
police
and
all
.
''
My
voice
was
shaking
like
a
bastard
.
``
Go
ahead
.
Yell
your
goddam
head
off
.
Fine
,
''
old
Maurice
said
.
``
Want
your
parents
to
know
you
spent
the
night
with
a
whore
?
High-class
kid
like
you
?
''
He
was
pretty
sharp
,
in
his
crumby
way
.
He
really
was
.
``
Leave
me
alone
.
If
you
'd
said
ten
,
it
'd
be
different
.
But
you
distinctly
--
''
``
Are
ya
gon
na
let
us
have
it
?
''
He
had
me
right
up
against
the
damn
door
.
He
was
almost
standing
on
top
of
me
,
his
crumby
old
hairy
stomach
and
all
.
``
Leave
me
alone
.
Get
the
hell
out
of
my
room
,
''
I
said
.
I
still
had
my
arms
folded
and
all
.
God
,
what
a
jerk
I
was
.
Then
Sunny
said
something
for
the
first
time
.
``
Hey
,
Maurice
.
Want
me
to
get
his
wallet
?
''
she
said
.
``
It
's
right
on
the
wutchamacallit
.
''
``
Yeah
,
get
it
.
''
``
Leave
my
wallet
alone
!
''
``
I
awreddy
got
it
,
''
Sunny
said
.
She
waved
five
bucks
at
me
.
``
See
?
All
I
'm
takin
'
is
the
five
you
owe
me
.
I
'm
no
crook
.
''
All
of
a
sudden
I
started
to
cry
.
I
'd
give
anything
if
I
had
n't
,
but
I
did
.
``
No
,
you
're
no
crooks
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
're
just
stealing
five
--
''
``
Shut
up
,
''
old
Maurice
said
,
and
gave
me
a
shove
.
``
Leave
him
alone
,
hey
,
''
Sunny
said
.
``
C'mon
,
hey
.
We
got
the
dough
he
owes
us
.
Let
's
go
.
C'mon
,
hey
.
''
``
I
'm
comin
'
,
''
old
Maurice
said
.
But
he
did
n't
.
``
I
mean
it
,
Maurice
,
hey
.
Leave
him
alone
.
''
``
Who
's
hurtin
'
anybody
?
''
he
said
,
innocent
as
hell
.
Then
what
he
did
,
he
snapped
his
finger
very
hard
on
my
pajamas
.
I
wo
n't
tell
you
where
he
snapped
it
,
but
it
hurt
like
hell
.
I
told
him
he
was
a
goddam
dirty
moron
.
``
What
's
that
?
''
he
said
.
He
put
his
hand
behind
his
ear
,
like
a
deaf
guy
.
``
What
's
that
?
What
am
I
?
''
I
was
still
sort
of
crying
.
I
was
so
damn
mad
and
nervous
and
all
.
``
You
're
a
dirty
moron
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
're
a
stupid
chiseling
moron
,
and
in
about
two
years
you
'll
be
one
of
those
scraggy
guys
that
come
up
to
you
on
the
street
and
ask
for
a
dime
for
coffee
.
You
'll
have
snot
all
over
your
dirty
filthy
overcoat
,
and
you
'll
be
--
''
Then
he
smacked
me
.
I
did
n't
even
try
to
get
out
of
the
way
or
duck
or
anything
.
All
I
felt
was
this
terrific
punch
in
my
stomach
.
I
was
n't
knocked
out
or
anything
,
though
,
because
I
remember
looking
up
from
the
floor
and
seeing
them
both
go
out
the
door
and
shut
it
.
Then
I
stayed
on
the
floor
a
fairly
long
time
,
sort
of
the
way
I
did
with
Stradlater
.
Only
,
this
time
I
thought
I
was
dying
.
I
really
did
.
I
thought
I
was
drowning
or
something
.
The
trouble
was
,
I
could
hardly
breathe
.
When
I
did
finally
get
up
,
I
had
to
walk
to
the
bathroom
all
doubled
up
and
holding
onto
my
stomach
and
all
.
But
I
'm
crazy
.
I
swear
to
God
I
am
.
About
halfway
to
the
bathroom
,
I
sort
of
started
pretending
I
had
a
bullet
in
my
guts
.
Old
'Maurice
had
plugged
me
.
Now
I
was
on
the
way
to
the
bathroom
to
get
a
good
shot
of
bourbon
or
something
to
steady
my
nerves
and
help
me
really
go
into
action
.
I
pictured
myself
coming
out
of
the
goddam
bathroom
,
dressed
and
all
,
with
my
automatic
in
my
pocket
,
and
staggering
around
a
little
bit
.
Then
I
'd
walk
downstairs
,
instead
of
using
the
elevator
.
I
'd
hold
onto
the
banister
and
all
,
with
this
blood
trickling
out
of
the
side
of
my
mouth
a
little
at
a
time
.
What
I
'd
do
,
I
'd
walk
down
a
few
floors
--
holding
onto
my
guts
,
blood
leaking
all
over
the
place
--
and
then
I
'd
ring
the
elevator
bell
.
As
soon
as
old
Maurice
opened
the
doors
,
he
'd
see
me
with
the
automatic
in
my
hand
and
he
'd
start
screaming
at
me
,
in
this
very
high-pitched
,
yellow-
belly
voice
,
to
leave
him
alone
.
But
I
'd
plug
him
anyway
.
Six
shots
right
through
his
fat
hairy
belly
.
Then
I
'd
throw
my
automatic
down
the
elevator
shaft
--
after
I
'd
wiped
off
all
the
finger
prints
and
all
.
Then
I
'd
crawl
back
to
my
room
and
call
up
Jane
and
have
her
come
over
and
bandage
up
my
guts
.
I
pictured
her
holding
a
cigarette
for
me
to
smoke
while
I
was
bleeding
and
all
.
The
goddam
movies
.
They
can
ruin
you
.
I
'm
not
kidding
.
I
stayed
in
the
bathroom
for
about
an
hour
,
taking
a
bath
and
all
.
Then
I
got
back
in
bed
.
It
took
me
quite
a
while
to
get
to
sleep
--
I
was
n't
even
tired
--
but
finally
I
did
.
What
I
really
felt
like
,
though
,
was
committing
suicide
.
I
felt
like
jumping
out
the
window
.
I
probably
would
've
done
it
,
too
,
if
I
'd
been
sure
somebody
'd
cover
me
up
as
soon
as
I
landed
.
I
did
n't
want
a
bunch
of
stupid
rubbernecks
looking
at
me
when
I
was
all
gory
.
15
I
did
n't
sleep
too
long
,
because
I
think
it
was
only
around
ten
o'clock
when
I
woke
up
.
I
felt
pretty
hungry
as
soon
as
I
had
a
cigarette
.
The
last
time
I
'd
eaten
was
those
two
hamburgers
I
had
with
Brossard
and
Ackley
when
we
went
in
to
Agerstown
to
the
movies
.
That
was
a
long
time
ago
.
It
seemed
like
fifty
years
ago
.
The
phone
was
right
next
to
me
,
and
I
started
to
call
down
and
have
them
send
up
some
breakfast
,
but
I
was
sort
of
afraid
they
might
send
it
up
with
old
Maurice
.
If
you
think
I
was
dying
to
see
him
again
,
you
're
crazy
.
So
I
just
laid
around
in
bed
for
a
while
and
smoked
another
cigarette
.
I
thought
of
giving
old
Jane
a
buzz
,
to
see
if
she
was
home
yet
and
all
,
but
I
was
n't
in
the
mood
.
What
I
did
do
,
I
gave
old
Sally
Hayes
a
buzz
.
She
went
to
Mary
A.
Woodruff
,
and
I
knew
she
was
home
because
I
'd
had
this
letter
from
her
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
.
I
was
n't
too
crazy
about
her
,
but
I
'd
known
her
for
years
.
I
used
to
think
she
was
quite
intelligent
,
in
my
stupidity
.
The
reason
I
did
was
because
she
knew
quite
a
lot
about
the
theater
and
plays
and
literature
and
all
that
stuff
.
If
somebody
knows
quite
a
lot
about
those
things
,
it
takes
you
quite
a
while
to
find
out
whether
they
're
really
stupid
or
not
.
It
took
me
years
to
find
it
out
,
in
old
Sally
's
case
.
I
think
I
'd
have
found
it
out
a
lot
sooner
if
we
had
n't
necked
so
damn
much
.
My
big
trouble
is
,
I
always
sort
of
think
whoever
I
'm
necking
is
a
pretty
intelligent
person
.
It
has
n't
got
a
goddam
thing
to
do
with
it
,
but
I
keep
thinking
it
anyway
.
Anyway
,
I
gave
her
a
buzz
.
First
the
maid
answered
.
Then
her
father
.
Then
she
got
on
.
``
Sally
?
''
I
said
.
``
Yes
--
who
is
this
?
''
she
said
.
She
was
quite
a
little
phony
.
I
'd
already
told
her
father
who
it
was
.
``
Holden
Caulfield
.
How
are
ya
?
''
``
Holden
!
I
'm
fine
!
How
are
you
?
''
``
Swell
.
Listen
.
How
are
ya
,
anyway
?
I
mean
how
's
school
?
''
``
Fine
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
mean
--
you
know
.
''
``
Swell
.
Well
,
listen
.
I
was
wondering
if
you
were
busy
today
.
It
's
Sunday
,
but
there
's
always
one
or
two
matinees
going
on
Sunday
.
Benefits
and
that
stuff
.
Would
you
care
to
go
?
''
``
I
'd
love
to
.
Grand
.
''
Grand
.
If
there
's
one
word
I
hate
,
it
's
grand
.
It
's
so
phony
.
For
a
second
,
I
was
tempted
to
tell
her
to
forget
about
the
matinee
.
But
we
chewed
the
fat
for
a
while
.
That
is
,
she
chewed
it
.
You
could
n't
get
a
word
in
edgewise
.
First
she
told
me
about
some
Harvard
guy
--
it
probably
was
a
freshman
,
but
she
did
n't
say
,
naturally
--
that
was
rushing
hell
out
of
her
.
Calling
her
up
night
and
day
.
Night
and
day
--
that
killed
me
.
Then
she
told
me
about
some
other
guy
,
some
West
Point
cadet
,
that
was
cutting
his
throat
over
her
too
.
Big
deal
.
I
told
her
to
meet
me
under
the
clock
at
the
Biltmore
at
two
o'clock
,
and
not
to
be
late
,
because
the
show
probably
started
at
two-thirty
.
She
was
always
late
.
Then
I
hung
up
.
She
gave
me
a
pain
in
the
ass
,
but
she
was
very
good-looking
.
After
I
made
the
date
with
old
Sally
,
I
got
out
of
bed
and
got
dressed
and
packed
my
bag
.
I
took
a
look
out
the
window
before
I
left
the
room
,
though
,
to
see
how
all
the
perverts
were
doing
,
but
they
all
had
their
shades
down
.
They
were
the
heighth
of
modesty
in
the
morning
.
Then
I
went
down
in
the
elevator
and
checked
out
.
I
did
n't
see
old
Maurice
around
anywhere
.
I
did
n't
break
my
neck
looking
for
him
,
naturally
,
the
bastard
.
I
got
a
cab
outside
the
hotel
,
but
I
did
n't
have
the
faintest
damn
idea
where
I
was
going
.
I
had
no
place
to
go
.
It
was
only
Sunday
,
and
I
could
n't
go
home
till
Wednesday
--
or
Tuesday
the
soonest
.
And
I
certainly
did
n't
feel
like
going
to
another
hotel
and
getting
my
brains
beat
out
.
So
what
I
did
,
I
told
the
driver
to
take
me
to
Grand
Central
Station
.
It
was
right
near
the
Biltmore
,
where
I
was
meeting
Sally
later
,
and
I
figured
what
I
'd
do
,
I
'd
check
my
bags
in
one
of
those
strong
boxes
that
they
give
you
a
key
to
,
then
get
some
breakfast
.
I
was
sort
of
hungry
.
While
I
was
in
the
cab
,
I
took
out
my
wallet
and
sort
of
counted
my
money
.
I
do
n't
remember
exactly
what
I
had
left
,
but
it
was
no
fortune
or
anything
.
I
'd
spent
a
king
's
ransom
in
about
two
lousy
weeks
.
I
really
had
.
I
'm
a
goddam
spendthrift
at
heart
.
What
I
do
n't
spend
,
I
lose
.
Half
the
time
I
sort
of
even
forget
to
pick
up
my
change
,
at
restaurants
and
night
clubs
and
all
.
It
drives
my
parents
crazy
.
You
ca
n't
blame
them
.
My
father
's
quite
wealthy
,
though
.
I
do
n't
know
how
much
he
makes
--
he
's
never
discussed
that
stuff
with
me
--
but
I
imagine
quite
a
lot
.
He
's
a
corporation
lawyer
.
Those
boys
really
haul
it
in
.
Another
reason
I
know
he
's
quite
well
off
,
he
's
always
investing
money
in
shows
on
Broadway
.
They
always
flop
,
though
,
and
it
drives
my
mother
crazy
when
he
does
it
.
She
has
n't
felt
too
healthy
since
my
brother
Allie
died
.
She
's
very
nervous
.
That
's
another
reason
why
I
hated
like
hell
for
her
to
know
I
got
the
ax
again
.
After
I
put
my
bags
in
one
of
those
strong
boxes
at
the
station
,
I
went
into
this
little
sandwich
bar
and
bad
breakfast
.
I
had
quite
a
large
breakfast
,
for
me
--
orange
juice
,
bacon
and
eggs
,
toast
and
coffee
.
Usually
I
just
drink
some
orange
juice
.
I
'm
a
very
light
eater
.
I
really
am
.
That
's
why
I
'm
so
damn
skinny
.
I
was
supposed
to
be
on
this
diet
where
you
eat
a
lot
of
starches
and
crap
,
to
gain
weight
and
all
,
but
I
did
n't
ever
do
it
.
When
I
'm
out
somewhere
,
I
generally
just
eat
a
Swiss
cheese
sandwich
and
a
malted
milk
.
It
is
n't
much
,
but
you
get
quite
a
lot
of
vitamins
in
the
malted
milk
.

While
I
was
eating
my
eggs
,
these
two
nuns
with
suitcases
and
all
--
I
guessed
they
were
moving
to
another
convent
or
something
and
were
waiting
for
a
train
--
came
in
and
sat
down
next
to
me
at
the
counter
.
They
did
n't
seem
to
know
what
the
hell
to
do
with
their
suitcases
,
so
I
gave
them
a
hand
.
They
were
these
very
inexpensive-looking
suitcases
--
the
ones
that
are
n't
genuine
leather
or
anything
.
It
is
n't
important
,
I
know
,
but
I
hate
it
when
somebody
has
cheap
suitcases
.
It
sounds
terrible
to
say
it
,
but
I
can
even
get
to
hate
somebody
,
just
looking
at
them
,
if
they
have
cheap
suitcases
with
them
.
Something
happened
once
.
For
a
while
when
I
was
at
Elkton
Hills
,
I
roomed
with
this
boy
,
Dick
Slagle
,
that
had
these
very
inexpensive
suitcases
.
He
used
to
keep
them
under
the
bed
,
instead
of
on
the
rack
,
so
that
nobody
'd
see
them
standing
next
to
mine
.
It
depressed
holy
hell
out
of
me
,
and
I
kept
wanting
to
throw
mine
out
or
something
,
or
even
trade
with
him
.
Mine
came
from
Mark
Cross
,
and
they
were
genuine
cowhide
and
all
that
crap
,
and
I
guess
they
cost
quite
a
pretty
penny
.
But
it
was
a
funny
thing
.
Here
's
what
happened
.
What
I
did
,
I
finally
put
my
suitcases
under
my
bed
,
instead
of
on
the
rack
,
so
that
old
Slagle
would
n't
get
a
goddam
inferiority
complex
about
it
.
But
here
's
what
he
did
.
The
day
after
I
put
mine
under
my
bed
,
he
took
them
out
and
put
them
back
on
the
rack
.
The
reason
he
did
it
,
it
took
me
a
while
to
find
out
,
was
because
he
wanted
people
to
think
my
bags
were
his
.
He
really
did
.
He
was
a
very
funny
guy
,
that
way
.
He
was
always
saying
snotty
things
about
them
,
my
suitcases
,
for
instance
.
He
kept
saying
they
were
too
new
and
bourgeois
.
That
was
his
favorite
goddam
word
.
He
read
it
somewhere
or
heard
it
somewhere
.
Everything
I
had
was
bourgeois
as
hell
.
Even
my
fountain
pen
was
bourgeois
.
He
borrowed
it
off
me
all
the
time
,
but
it
was
bourgeois
anyway
.
We
only
roomed
together
about
two
months
.
Then
we
both
asked
to
be
moved
.
And
the
funny
thing
was
,
I
sort
of
missed
him
after
we
moved
,
because
he
had
a
helluva
good
sense
of
humor
and
we
had
a
lot
of
fun
sometimes
.
I
would
n't
be
surprised
if
he
missed
me
,
too
.
At
first
he
only
used
to
be
kidding
when
he
called
my
stuff
bourgeois
,
and
I
did
n't
give
a
damn
--
it
was
sort
of
funny
,
in
fact
.
Then
,
after
a
while
,
you
could
tell
he
was
n't
kidding
any
more
.
The
thing
is
,
it
's
really
hard
to
be
roommates
with
people
if
your
suitcases
are
much
better
than
theirs
--
if
yours
are
really
good
ones
and
theirs
are
n't
.
You
think
if
they
're
intelligent
and
all
,
the
other
person
,
and
have
a
good
sense
of
humor
,
that
they
do
n't
give
a
damn
whose
suitcases
are
better
,
but
they
do
.
They
really
do
.
It
's
one
of
the
reasons
why
I
roomed
with
a
stupid
bastard
like
Stradlater
.
At
least
his
suitcases
were
as
good
as
mine
.
Anyway
,
these
two
nuns
were
sitting
next
to
me
,
and
we
sort
of
struck
up
a
conversation
.
The
one
right
next
to
me
had
one
of
those
straw
baskets
that
you
see
nuns
and
Salvation
Army
babes
collecting
dough
with
around
Christmas
time
.
You
see
them
standing
on
corners
,
especially
on
Fifth
Avenue
,
in
front
of
the
big
department
stores
and
all
.
Anyway
,
the
one
next
to
me
dropped
hers
on
the
floor
and
I
reached
down
and
picked
it
up
for
her
.
I
asked
her
if
she
was
out
collecting
money
for
charity
and
all
.
She
said
no
.
She
said
she
could
n't
get
it
in
her
suitcase
when
she
was
packing
it
and
she
was
just
carrying
it
.
She
had
a
pretty
nice
smile
when
she
looked
at
you
.
She
had
a
big
nose
,
and
she
had
on
those
glasses
with
sort
of
iron
rims
that
are
n't
too
attractive
,
but
she
had
a
helluva
kind
face
.
``
I
thought
if
you
were
taking
up
a
collection
,
''
I
told
her
,
``
I
could
make
a
small
contribution
.
You
could
keep
the
money
for
when
you
do
take
up
a
collection
.
''
``
Oh
,
how
very
kind
of
you
,
''
she
said
,
and
the
other
one
,
her
friend
,
looked
over
at
me
.
The
other
one
was
reading
a
little
black
book
while
she
drank
her
coffee
.
It
looked
like
a
Bible
,
but
it
was
too
skinny
.
It
was
a
Bible-type
book
,
though
.
All
the
two
of
them
were
eating
for
breakfast
was
toast
and
coffee
.
That
depressed
me
.
I
hate
it
if
I
'm
eating
bacon
and
eggs
or
something
and
somebody
else
is
only
eating
toast
and
coffee
.
They
let
me
give
them
ten
bucks
as
a
contribution
.
They
kept
asking
me
if
I
was
sure
I
could
afford
it
and
all
.
I
told
them
I
had
quite
a
bit
of
money
with
me
,
but
they
did
n't
seem
to
believe
me
.
They
took
it
,
though
,
finally
.
The
both
of
them
kept
thanking
me
so
much
it
was
embarrassing
.
I
swung
the
conversation
around
to
general
topics
and
asked
them
where
they
were
going
.
They
said
they
were
schoolteachers
and
that
they
'd
just
come
from
Chicago
and
that
they
were
going
to
start
teaching
at
some
convent
on
168th
Street
or
186th
Street
or
one
of
those
streets
way
the
hell
uptown
.
The
one
next
to
me
,
with
the
iron
glasses
,
said
she
taught
English
and
her
friend
taught
history
and
American
government
.
Then
I
started
wondering
like
a
bastard
what
the
one
sitting
next
to
me
,
that
taught
English
,
thought
about
,
being
a
nun
and
all
,
when
she
read
certain
books
for
English
.
Books
not
necessarily
with
a
lot
of
sexy
stuff
in
them
,
but
books
with
lovers
and
all
in
them
.
Take
old
Eustacia
Vye
,
in
The
Return
of
the
Native
by
Thomas
Hardy
.
She
was
n't
too
sexy
or
anything
,
but
even
so
you
ca
n't
help
wondering
what
a
nun
maybe
thinks
about
when
she
reads
about
old
Eustacia
.
I
did
n't
say
anything
,
though
,
naturally
.
All
I
said
was
English
was
my
best
subject
.
``
Oh
,
really
?
Oh
,
I
'm
so
glad
!
''
the
one
with
the
glasses
,
that
taught
English
,
said
.
``
What
have
you
read
this
year
?
I
'd
be
very
interested
to
know
.
''
She
was
really
nice
.
``
Well
,
most
of
the
time
we
were
on
the
Anglo-Saxons
.
Beowulf
,
and
old
Grendel
,
and
Lord
Randal
My
Son
,
and
all
those
things
.
But
we
had
to
read
outside
books
for
extra
credit
once
in
a
while
.
I
read
The
Return
of
the
Native
by
Thomas
Hardy
,
and
Romeo
and
Juliet
and
Julius
--
''
``
Oh
,
Romeo
and
Juliet
!
Lovely
!
Did
n't
you
just
love
it
?
''
She
certainly
did
n't
sound
much
like
a
nun
.
``
Yes
.
I
did
.
I
liked
it
a
lot
.
There
were
a
few
things
I
did
n't
like
about
it
,
but
it
was
quite
moving
,
on
the
whole
.
''
``
What
did
n't
you
like
about
it
?
Can
you
remember
?
''
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
it
was
sort
of
embarrassing
,
in
a
way
,
to
be
talking
about
Romeo
and
Juliet
with
her
.
I
mean
that
play
gets
pretty
sexy
in
some
parts
,
and
she
was
a
nun
and
all
,
but
she
asked
me
,
so
I
discussed
it
with
her
for
a
while
.
``
Well
,
I
'm
not
too
crazy
about
Romeo
and
Juliet
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
mean
I
like
them
,
but
--
I
do
n't
know
.
They
get
pretty
annoying
sometimes
.
I
mean
I
felt
much
sorrier
when
old
Mercutio
got
killed
than
when
Romeo
and
Juliet
did
.
The
think
is
,
I
never
liked
Romeo
too
much
after
Mercutio
gets
stabbed
by
that
other
man
--
Juliet
's
cousin
--
what
's
his
name
?
''
``
Tybalt
.
''
``
That
's
right

Tybalt
,
''
I
said
--
I
always
forget
that
guy
's
name
.
``
It
was
Romeo
's
fault
.
I
mean
I
liked
him
the
best
in
the
play
,
old
Mercutio
.
I
do
n't
know
.
All
those
Montagues
and
Capulets
,
they
're
all
right
--
especially
Juliet
--
but
Mercutio
,
he
was
--
it
's
hard
to
explain
.
He
was
very
smart
and
entertaining
and
all
.
The
thing
is
,
it
drives
me
crazy
if
somebody
gets
killed
--
especially
somebody
very
smart
and
entertaining
and
all
--
and
it
's
somebody
else
's
fault
.
Romeo
and
Juliet
,
at
least
it
was
their
own
fault
.
''
``
What
school
do
you
go
to
?
''
she
asked
me
.
She
probably
wanted
to
get
off
the
subject
of
Romeo
and
Juliet
.
I
told
her
Pencey
,
and
she
'd
heard
of
it
.
She
said
it
was
a
very
good
school
.
I
let
it
pass
,
though
.
Then
the
other
one
,
the
one
that
taught
history
and
government
,
said
they
'd
better
be
running
along
.
I
took
their
check
off
them
,
but
they
would
n't
let
me
pay
it
.
The
one
with
the
glasses
made
me
give
it
back
to
her
.
``
You
've
been
more
than
generous
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
're
a
very
sweet
boy
.
''
She
certainly
was
nice
.
She
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
old
Ernest
Morrow
's
mother
,
the
one
I
met
on
the
train
.
When
she
smiled
,
mostly
.
``
We
've
enjoyed
talking
to
you
so
much
,
''
she
said
.
I
said
I
'd
enjoyed
talking
to
them
a
lot
,
too
.
I
meant
it
,
too
.
I
'd
have
enjoyed
it
even
more
though
,
I
think
,
if
I
had
n't
been
sort
of
afraid
,
the
whole
time
I
was
talking
to
them
,
that
they
'd
all
of
a
sudden
try
to
find
out
if
I
was
a
Catholic
.
Catholics
are
always
trying
to
find
out
if
you
're
a
Catholic
.
It
happens
to
me
a
lot
,
I
know
,
partly
because
my
last
name
is
Irish
,
and
most
people
of
Irish
descent
are
Catholics
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
my
father
was
a
Catholic
once
.
He
quit
,
though
,
when
he
married
my
mother
.
But
Catholics
are
always
trying
to
find
out
if
you
're
a
Catholic
even
if
they
do
n't
know
your
last
name
.
I
knew
this
one
Catholic
boy
,
Louis
Shaney
,
when
I
was
at
the
Whooton
School
.
He
was
the
first
boy
I
ever
met
there
.
He
and
I
were
sitting
in
the
first
two
chairs
outside
the
goddam
infirmary
,
the
day
school
opened
,
waiting
for
our
physicals
,
and
we
sort
of
struck
up
this
conversation
about
tennis
.
He
was
quite
interested
in
tennis
,
and
so
was
I
.
He
told
me
he
went
to
the
Nationals
at
Forest
Hills
every
summer
,
and
I
told
him
I
did
too
,
and
then
we
talked
about
certain
hot-shot
tennis
players
for
quite
a
while
.
He
knew
quite
a
lot
about
tennis
,
for
a
kid
his
age
.
He
really
did
.
Then
,
after
a
while
,
right
in
the
middle
of
the
goddam
conversation
,
he
asked
me
,
``
Did
you
happen
to
notice
where
the
Catholic
church
is
in
town
,
by
any
chance
?
''
The
thing
was
,
you
could
tell
by
the
way
he
asked
me
that
he
was
trying
to
find
out
if
I
was
a
Catholic
.
He
really
was
.
Not
that
he
was
prejudiced
or
anything
,
but
he
just
wanted
to
know
.
He
was
enjoying
the
conversation
about
tennis
and
all
,
but
you
could
tell
he
would
've
enjoyed
it
more
if
I
was
a
Catholic
and
all
.
That
kind
of
stuff
drives
me
crazy
.
I
'm
not
saying
it
ruined
our
conversation
or
anything
--
it
did
n't
--
but
it
sure
as
hell
did
n't
do
it
any
good
.
That
's
why
I
was
glad
those
two
nuns
did
n't
ask
me
if
I
was
a
Catholic
.
It
would
n't
have
spoiled
the
conversation
if
they
had
,
but
it
would
've
been
different
,
probably
.
I
'm
not
saying
I
blame
Catholics
.
I
do
n't
.
I
'd
be
the
same
way
,
probably
,
if
I
was
a
Catholic
.
It
's
just
like
those
suitcases
I
was
telling
you
about
,
in
a
way
.
All
I
'm
saying
is
that
it
's
no
good
for
a
nice
conversation
.
That
's
all
I
'm
saying
.
When
they
got
up
to
go
,
the
two
nuns
,
I
did
something
very
stupid
and
embarrassing
.
I
was
smoking
a
cigarette
,
and
when
I
stood
up
to
say
good-by
to
them
,
by
mistake
I
blew
some
smoke
in
their
face
.
I
did
n't
mean
to
,
but
I
did
it
.
I
apologized
like
a
madman
,
and
they
were
very
polite
and
nice
about
it
,
but
it
was
very
embarrassing
anyway
.
After
they
left
,
I
started
getting
sorry
that
I
'd
only
given
them
ten
bucks
for
their
collection
.
But
the
thing
was
,
I
'd
made
that
date
to
go
to
a
matinee
with
old
Sally
Hayes
,
and
I
needed
to
keep
some
dough
for
the
tickets
and
stuff
.
I
was
sorry
anyway
,
though
.
Goddam
money
.
It
always
ends
up
making
you
blue
as
hell
.
16
After
I
had
my
breakfast
,
it
was
only
around
noon
,
and
I
was
n't
meeting
old
Sally
till
two
o'clock
,
so
I
started
taking
this
long
walk
.
I
could
n't
stop
thinking
about
those
two
nuns
.
I
kept
thinking
about
that
beatup
old
straw
basket
they
went
around
collecting
money
with
when
they
were
n't
teaching
school
.
I
kept
trying
to
picture
my
mother
or
somebody
,
or
my
aunt
,
or
Sally
Hayes
's
crazy
mother
,
standing
outside
some
department
store
and
collecting
dough
for
poor
people
in
a
beat-up
old
straw
basket
.
It
was
hard
to
picture
.
Not
so
much
my
mother
,
but
those
other
two
.
My
aunt
's
pretty
charitable
--
she
does
a
lot
of
Red
Cross
work
and
all
--
but
she
's
very
well-dressed
and
all
,
and
when
she
does
anything
charitable
she
's
always
very
well-dressed
and
has
lipstick
on
and
all
that
crap
.
I
could
n't
picture
her
doing
anything
for
charity
if
she
had
to
wear
black
clothes
and
no
lipstick
while
she
was
doing
it
.
And
old
Sally
Hayes
's
mother
.
Jesus
Christ
.
The
only
way
she
could
go
around
with
a
basket
collecting
dough
would
be
if
everybody
kissed
her
ass
for
her
when
they
made
a
contribution
.
If
they
just
dropped
their
dough
in
her
basket
,
then
walked
away
without
saying
anything
to
her
,
ignoring
her
and
all
,
she
'd
quit
in
about
an
hour
.
She
'd
get
bored
.
She
'd
hand
in
her
basket
and
then
go
someplace
swanky
for
lunch
.
That
's
what
I
liked
about
those
nuns
.
You
could
tell
,
for
one
thing
,
that
they
never
went
anywhere
swanky
for
lunch
.
It
made
me
so
damn
sad
when
I
thought
about
it
,
their
never
going
anywhere
swanky
for
lunch
or
anything
.
I
knew
it
was
n't
too
important
,
but
it
made
me
sad
anyway
.
I
started
walking
over
toward
Broadway
,
just
for
the
hell
of
it
,
because
I
had
n't
been
over
there
in
years
.
Besides
,
I
wanted
to
find
a
record
store
that
was
open
on
Sunday
.
There
was
this
record
I
wanted
to
get
for
Phoebe
,
called
``
Little
Shirley
Beans
.
''
It
was
a
very
hard
record
to
get
.
It
was
about
a
little
kid
that
would
n't
go
out
of
the
house
because
two
of
her
front
teeth
were
out
and
she
was
ashamed
to
.
I
heard
it
at
Pencey
.
A
boy
that
lived
on
the
next
floor
had
it
,
and
I
tried
to
buy
it
off
him
because
I
knew
it
would
knock
old
Phoebe
out
,
but
he
would
n't
sell
it
.
It
was
a
very
old
,
terrific
record
that
this
colored
girl
singer
,
Estelle
Fletcher
,
made
about
twenty
years
ago
.
She
sings
it
very
Dixieland
and
whorehouse
,
and
it
does
n't
sound
at
all
mushy
.
If
a
white
girl
was
singing
it
,
she
'd
make
it
sound
cute
as
hell
,
but
old
Estelle
Fletcher
knew
what
the
hell
she
was
doing
,
and
it
was
one
of
the
best
records
I
ever
heard
.
I
figured
I
'd
buy
it
in
some
store
that
was
open
on
Sunday
and
then
I
'd
take
it
up
to
the
park
with
me
.
It
was
Sunday
and
Phoebe
goes
rollerskating
in
the
park
on
Sundays
quite
frequently
.
I
knew
where
she
hung
out
mostly
.
It
was
n't
as
cold
as
it
was
the
day
before
,
but
the
sun
still
was
n't
out
,
and
it
was
n't
too
nice
for
walking
.
But
there
was
one
nice
thing
.
This
family
that
you
could
tell
just
came
out
of
some
church
were
walking
right
in
front
of
me
--
a
father
,
a
mother
,
and
a
little
kid
about
six
years
old
.
They
looked
sort
of
poor
.
The
father
had
on
one
of
those
pearl-gray
hats
that
poor
guys
wear
a
lot
when
they
want
to
look
sharp
.
He
and
his
wife
were
just
walking
along
,
talking
,
not
paying
any
attention
to
their
kid
.
The
kid
was
swell
.
He
was
walking
in
the
street
,
instead
of
on
the
sidewalk
,
but
right
next
to
the
curb
.
He
was
making
out
like
he
was
walking
a
very
straight
line
,
the
way
kids
do
,
and
the
whole
time
he
kept
singing
and
humming
.
I
got
up
closer
so
I
could
hear
what
he
was
singing
.
He
was
singing
that
song
,
``
If
a
body
catch
a
body
coming
through
the
rye
.
''
He
had
a
pretty
little
voice
,
too
.
He
was
just
singing
for
the
hell
of
it
,
you
could
tell
.
The
cars
zoomed
by
,
brakes
screeched
all
over
the
place
,
his
parents
paid
no
attention
to
him
,
and
he
kept
on
walking
next
to
the
curb
and
singing
``
If
a
body
catch
a
body
coming
through
the
rye
.
''
It
made
me
feel
better
.
It
made
me
feel
not
so
depressed
any
more
.
Broadway
was
mobbed
and
messy
.
It
was
Sunday
,
and
only
about
twelve
o'clock
,
but
it
was
mobbed
anyway
.
Everybody
was
on
their
way
to
the
movies
--
the
Paramount
or
the
Astor
or
the
Strand
or
the
Capitol
or
one
of
those
crazy
places
.
Everybody
was
all
dressed
up
,
because
it
was
Sunday
,
and
that
made
it
worse
.
But
the
worst
part
was
that
you
could
tell
they
all
wanted
to
go
to
the
movies
.
I
could
n't
stand
looking
at
them
.
I
can
understand
somebody
going
to
the
movies
because
there
's
nothing
else
to
do
,
but
when
somebody
really
wants
to
go
,
and
even
walks
fast
so
as
to
get
there
quicker
,
then
it
depresses
hell
out
of
me
.
Especially
if
I
see
millions
of
people
standing
in
one
of
those
long
,
terrible
lines
,
all
the
way
down
the
block
,
waiting
with
this
terrific
patience
for
seats
and
all
.
Boy
,
I
could
n't
get
off
that
goddam
Broadway
fast
enough
.
I
was
lucky
.
The
first
record
store
I
went
into
had
a
copy
of
``
Little
Shirley
Beans
.
''
They
charged
me
five
bucks
for
it
,
because
it
was
so
hard
to
get
,
but
I
did
n't
care
.
Boy
,
it
made
me
so
happy
all
of
a
sudden
.
I
could
hardly
wait
to
get
to
the
park
to
see
if
old
Phoebe
was
around
so
that
I
could
give
it
to
her
.
When
I
came
out
of
the
record
store
,
I
passed
this
drugstore
,
and
I
went
in
.
I
figured
maybe
I
'd
give
old
Jane
a
buzz
and
see
if
she
was
home
for
vacation
yet
.
So
I
went
in
a
phone
booth
and
called
her
up
.
The
only
trouble
was
,
her
mother
answered
the
phone
,
so
I
had
to
hang
up
.
I
did
n't
feel
like
getting
involved
in
a
long
conversation
and
all
with
her
.
I
'm
not
crazy
about
talking
to
girls
'
mothers
on
the
phone
anyway
.
I
should
've
at
least
asked
her
if
Jane
was
home
yet
,
though
.
It
would
n't
have
killed
me
.
But
I
did
n't
feel
like
it
.
You
really
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
that
stuff
.
I
still
had
to
get
those
damn
theater
tickets
,
so
I
bought
a
paper
and
looked
up
to
see
what
shows
were
playing
.
On
account
of
it
was
Sunday
,
there
were
only
about
three
shows
playing
.
So
what
I
did
was
,
I
went
over
and
bought
two
orchestra
seats
for
I
Know
My
Love
.
It
was
a
benefit
performance
or
something
.
I
did
n't
much
want
to
see
it
,
but
I
knew
old
Sally
,
the
queen
of
the
phonies
,
would
start
drooling
all
over
the
place
when
I
told
her
I
had
tickets
for
that
,
because
the
Lunts
were
in
it
and
all
.
She
liked
shows
that
are
supposed
to
be
very
sophisticated
and
dry
and
all
,
with
the
Lunts
and
all
.
I
do
n't
.
I
do
n't
like
any
shows
very
much
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
They
're
not
as
bad
as
movies
,
but
they
're
certainly
nothing
to
rave
about
.
In
the
first
place
,
I
hate
actors
.
They
never
act
like
people
.
They
just
think
they
do
.
Some
of
the
good
ones
do
,
in
a
very
slight
way
,
but
not
in
a
way
that
's
fun
to
watch
.
And
if
any
actor
's
really
good
,
you
can
always
tell
he
knows
he
's
good
,
and
that
spoils
it
.
You
take
Sir
Laurence
Olivier
,
for
example
.
I
saw
him
in
Hamlet
.
D.B
.
took
Phoebe
and
I
to
see
it
last
year
.
He
treated
us
to
lunch
first
,
and
then
he
took
us
.
He
'd
already
seen
it
,
and
the
way
he
talked
about
it
at
lunch
,
I
was
anxious
as
hell
to
see
it
,
too
.
But
I
did
n't
enjoy
it
much
.
I
just
do
n't
see
what
's
so
marvelous
about
Sir
Laurence
Olivier
,
that
's
all
.
He
has
a
terrific
voice
,
and
he
's
a
helluva
handsome
guy
,
and
he
's
very
nice
to
watch
when
he
's
walking
or
dueling
or
something
,
but
he
was
n't
at
all
the
way
D.B
.
said
Hamlet
was
.
He
was
too
much
like
a
goddam
general
,
instead
of
a
sad
,
screwed-up
type
guy
.
The
best
part
in
the
whole
picture
was
when
old
Ophelia
's
brother
--
the
one
that
gets
in
the
duel
with
Hamlet
at
the
very
end
--
was
going
away
and
his
father
was
giving
him
a
lot
of
advice
.
While
the
father
kept
giving
him
a
lot
of
advice
,
old
Ophelia
was
sort
of
horsing
around
with
her
brother
,
taking
his
dagger
out
of
the
holster
,
and
teasing
him
and
all
while
he
was
trying
to
look
interested
in
the
bull
his
father
was
shooting
.
That
was
nice
.
I
got
a
big
bang
out
of
that
.
But
you
do
n't
see
that
kind
of
stuff
much
.
The
only
thing
old
Phoebe
liked
was
when
Hamlet
patted
this
dog
on
the
head
.
She
thought
that
was
funny
and
nice
,
and
it
was
.
What
I
'll
have
to
do
is
,
I
'll
have
to
read
that
play
.
The
trouble
with
me
is
,
I
always
have
to
read
that
stuff
by
myself
.
If
an
actor
acts
it
out
,
I
hardly
listen
.
I
keep
worrying
about
whether
he
's
going
to
do
something
phony
every
minute
.
After
I
got
the
tickets
to
the
Lunts
'
show
,
I
took
a
cab
up
to
the
park
.
I
should
've
taken
a
subway
or
something
,
because
I
was
getting
slightly
low
on
dough
,
but
I
wanted
to
get
off
that
damn
Broadway
as
fast
as
I
could
.
It
was
lousy
in
the
park
.
It
was
n't
too
cold
,
but
the
sun
still
was
n't
out
,
and
there
did
n't
look
like
there
was
anything
in
the
park
except
dog
crap
and
globs
of
spit
and
cigar
butts
from
old
men
,
and
the
benches
all
looked
like
they
'd
be
wet
if
you
sat
down
on
them
.
It
made
you
depressed
,
and
every
once
in
a
while
,
for
no
reason
,
you
got
goose
flesh
while
you
walked
.
It
did
n't
seem
at
all
like
Christmas
was
coming
soon
.
It
did
n't
seem
like
anything
was
coming
.
But
I
kept
walking
over
to
the
Mall
anyway
,
because
that
's
where
Phoebe
usually
goes
when
she
's
in
the
park
.
She
likes
to
skate
near
the
bandstand
.
It
's
funny
.
That
's
the
same
place
I
used
to
like
to
skate
when
I
was
a
kid
.
When
I
got
there
,
though
,
I
did
n't
see
her
around
anywhere
.
There
were
a
few
kids
around
,
skating
and
all
,
and
two
boys
were
playing
Flys
Up
with
a
soft
ball
,
but
no
Phoebe
.
I
saw
one
kid
about
her
age
,
though
,
sitting
on
a
bench
all
by
herself
,
tightening
her
skate
.
I
thought
maybe
she
might
know
Phoebe
and
could
tell
me
where
she
was
or
something
,
so
I
went
over
and
sat
down
next
to
her
and
asked
her
,
``
Do
you
know
Phoebe
Caulfield
,
by
any
chance
?
''
``
Who
?
''
she
said
.
All
she
had
on
was
jeans
and
about
twenty
sweaters
.
You
could
tell
her
mother
made
them
for
her
,
because
they
were
lumpy
as
hell
.
``
Phoebe
Caulfield
.
She
lives
on
Seventy-first
Street
.
She
's
in
the
fourth
grade
,
over
at
--
''
``
You
know
Phoebe
?
''
``
Yeah
,
I
'm
her
brother
.
You
know
where
she
is
?
''
``
She
's
in
Miss
Callon
's
class
,
is
n't
she
?
''
the
kid
said
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Yes
,
I
think
she
is
.
''
``
She
's
prob'ly
in
the
museum
,
then
.
We
went
last
Saturday
,
''
the
kid
said
.
``
Which
museum
?
''
I
asked
her
.
She
shrugged
her
shoulders
,
sort
of
.
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
said
.
``
The
museum
.
''
``
I
know
,
but
the
one
where
the
pictures
are
,
or
the
one
where
the
Indians
are
?
''
``
The
one
where
the
Indians
.
''
``
Thanks
a
lot
,
''
I
said
.
I
got
up
and
started
to
go
,
but
then
I
suddenly
remembered
it
was
Sunday
.
``
This
is
Sunday
,
''
I
told
the
kid
.
She
looked
up
at
me
.
``
Oh
.
Then
she
is
n't
.
''
She
was
having
a
helluva
time
tightening
her
skate
.
She
did
n't
have
any
gloves
on
or
anything
and
her
hands
were
all
red
and
cold
.
I
gave
her
a
hand
with
it
.
Boy
,
I
had
n't
had
a
skate
key
in
my
hand
for
years
.
It
did
n't
feel
funny
,
though
.
You
could
put
a
skate
key
in
my
hand
fifty
years
from
now
,
in
pitch
dark
,
and
I
'd
still
know
what
it
is
.
She
thanked
me
and
all
when
I
had
it
tightened
for
her
.
She
was
a
very
nice
,
polite
little
kid
.
God
,
I
love
it
when
a
kid
's
nice
and
polite
when
you
tighten
their
skate
for
them
or
something
.
Most
kids
are
.
They
really
are
.
I
asked
her
if
she
'd
care
to
have
a
hot
chocolate
or
something
with
me
,
but
she
said
no
,
thank
you
.
She
said
she
had
to
meet
her
friend
.
Kids
always
have
to
meet
their
friend
.
That
kills
me
.
Even
though
it
was
Sunday
and
Phoebe
would
n't
be
there
with
her
class
or
anything
,
and
even
though
it
was
so
damp
and
lousy
out
,
I
walked
all
the
way
through
the
park
over
to
the
Museum
of
Natural
History
.
I
knew
that
was
the
museum
the
kid
with
the
skate
key
meant
.
I
knew
that
whole
museum
routine
like
a
book
.
Phoebe
went
to
the
same
school
I
went
to
when
I
was
a
kid
,
and
we
used
to
go
there
all
the
time
.
We
had
this
teacher
,
Miss
Aigletinger
,
that
took
us
there
damn
near
every
Saturday
.
Sometimes
we
looked
at
the
animals
and
sometimes
we
looked
at
the
stuff
the
Indians
had
made
in
ancient
times
.
Pottery
and
straw
baskets
and
all
stuff
like
that
.
I
get
very
happy
when
I
think
about
it
.
Even
now
.
I
remember
after
we
looked
at
all
the
Indian
stuff
,
usually
we
went
to
see
some
movie
in
this
big
auditorium
.
Columbus
.
They
were
always
showing
Columbus
discovering
America
,
having
one
helluva
time
getting
old
Ferdinand
and
Isabella
to
lend
him
the
dough
to
buy
ships
with
,
and
then
the
sailors
mutinying
on
him
and
all
.
Nobody
gave
too
much
of
a
damn
about
old
Columbus
,
but
you
always
had
a
lot
of
candy
and
gum
and
stuff
with
you
,
and
the
inside
of
that
auditorium
had
such
a
nice
smell
.
It
always
smelled
like
it
was
raining
outside
,
even
if
it
was
n't
,
and
you
were
in
the
only
nice
,
dry
,
cosy
place
in
the
world
.
I
loved
that
damn
museum
.
I
remember
you
had
to
go
through
the
Indian
Room
to
get
to
the
auditorium
.
It
was
a
long
,
long
room
,
and
you
were
only
supposed
to
whisper
.
The
teacher
would
go
first
,
then
the
class
.
You
'd
be
two
rows
of
kids
,
and
you
'd
have
a
partner
.
Most
of
the
time
my
partner
was
this
girl
named
Gertrude
Levine
.
She
always
wanted
to
hold
your
hand
,
and
her
hand
was
always
sticky
or
sweaty
or
something
.
The
floor
was
all
stone
,
and
if
you
had
some
marbles
in
your
hand
and
you
dropped
them
,
they
bounced
like
madmen
all
over
the
floor
and
made
a
helluva
racket
,
and
the
teacher
would
hold
up
the
class
and
go
back
and
see
what
the
hell
was
going
on
.
She
never
got
sore
,
though
,
Miss
Aigletinger
.
Then
you
'd
pass
by
this
long
,
long
Indian
war
canoe
,
about
as
long
as
three
goddam
Cadillacs
in
a
row
,
with
about
twenty
Indians
in
it
,
some
of
them
paddling
,
some
of
them
just
standing
around
looking
tough
,
and
they
all
had
war
paint
all
over
their
faces
.
There
was
one
very
spooky
guy
in
the
back
of
the
canoe
,
with
a
mask
on
.
He
was
the
witch
doctor
.
He
gave
me
the
creeps
,
but
I
liked
him
anyway
.
Another
thing
,
if
you
touched
one
of
the
paddles
or
anything
while
you
were
passing
,
one
of
the
guards
would
say
to
you
,
``
Do
n't
touch
anything
,
children
,
''
but
he
always
said
it
in
a
nice
voice
,
not
like
a
goddam
cop
or
anything
.
Then
you
'd
pass
by
this
big
glass
case
,
with
Indians
inside
it
rubbing
sticks
together
to
make
a
fire
,
and
a
squaw
weaving
a
blanket
.
The
squaw
that
was
weaving
the
blanket
was
sort
of
bending
over
,
and
you
could
see
her
bosom
and
all
.
We
all
used
to
sneak
a
good
look
at
it
,
even
the
girls
,
because
they
were
only
little
kids
and
they
did
n't
have
any
more
bosom
than
we
did
.
Then
,
just
before
you
went
inside
the
auditorium
,
right
near
the
doors
,
you
passed
this
Eskimo
.
He
was
sitting
over
a
hole
in
this
icy
lake
,
and
he
was
fishing
through
it
.
He
had
about
two
fish
right
next
to
the
hole
,
that
he
'd
already
caught
.
Boy
,
that
museum
was
full
of
glass
cases
.
There
were
even
more
upstairs
,
with
deer
inside
them
drinking
at
water
holes
,
and
birds
flying
south
for
the
winter
.
The
birds
nearest
you
were
all
stuffed
and
hung
up
on
wires
,
and
the
ones
in
back
were
just
painted
on
the
wall
,
but
they
all
looked
like
they
were
really
flying
south
,
and
if
you
bent
your
head
down
and
sort
of
looked
at
them
upside
down
,
they
looked
in
an
even
bigger
hurry
to
fly
south
.
The
best
thing
,
though
,
in
that
museum
was
that
everything
always
stayed
right
where
it
was
.
Nobody
'd
move
.
You
could
go
there
a
hundred
thousand
times
,
and
that
Eskimo
would
still
be
just
finished
catching
those
two
fish
,
the
birds
would
still
be
on
their
way
south
,
the
deers
would
still
be
drinking
out
of
that
water
hole
,
with
their
pretty
antlers
and
their
pretty
,
skinny
legs
,
and
that
squaw
with
the
naked
bosom
would
still
be
weaving
that
same
blanket
.
Nobody
'd
be
different
.
The
only
thing
that
would
be
different
would
be
you
.
Not
that
you
'd
be
so
much
older
or
anything
.
It
would
n't
be
that
,
exactly
.
You
'd
just
be
different
,
that
's
all
.
You
'd
have
an
overcoat
on
this
time
.
Or
the
kid
that
was
your
partner
in
line
the
last
time
had
got
scarlet
fever
and
you
'd
have
a
new
partner
.
Or
you
'd
have
a
substitute
taking
the
class
,
instead
of
Miss
Aigletinger
.
Or
you
'd
heard
your
mother
and
father
having
a
terrific
fight
in
the
bathroom
.
Or
you
'd
just
passed
by
one
of
those
puddles
in
the
street
with
gasoline
rainbows
in
them
.
I
mean
you
'd
be
different
in
some
way
--
I
ca
n't
explain
what
I
mean
.
And
even
if
I
could
,
I
'm
not
sure
I
'd
feel
like
it
.
I
took
my
old
hunting
hat
out
of
my
pocket
while
I
walked
,
and
put
it
on
.
I
knew
I
would
n't
meet
anybody
that
knew
me
,
and
it
was
pretty
damp
out
.
I
kept
walking
and
walking
,
and
I
kept
thinking
about
old
Phoebe
going
to
that
museum
on
Saturdays
the
way
I
used
to
.
I
thought
how
she
'd
see
the
same
stuff
I
used
to
see
,
and
how
she
'd
be
different
every
time
she
saw
it
.
It
did
n't
exactly
depress
me
to
think
about
it
,
but
it
did
n't
make
me
feel
gay
as
hell
,
either
.
Certain
things
they
should
stay
the
way
they
are
.
You
ought
to
be
able
to
stick
them
in
one
of
those
big
glass
cases
and
just
leave
them
alone
.
I
know
that
's
impossible
,
but
it
's
too
bad
anyway
.
Anyway
,
I
kept
thinking
about
all
that
while
I
walked
.
I
passed
by
this
playground
and
stopped
and
watched
a
couple
of
very
tiny
kids
on
a
seesaw
.
One
of
them
was
sort
of
fat
,
and
I
put
my
hand
on
the
skinny
kid
's
end
,
to
sort
of
even
up
the
weight
,
but
you
could
tell
they
did
n't
want
me
around
,
so
I
let
them
alone
.
Then
a
funny
thing
happened
.
When
I
got
to
the
museum
,
all
of
a
sudden
I
would
n't
have
gone
inside
for
a
million
bucks
.
It
just
did
n't
appeal
to
me
--
and
here
I
'd
walked
through
the
whole
goddam
park
and
looked
forward
to
it
and
all
.
If
Phoebe
'd
been
there
,
I
probably
would
have
,
but
she
was
n't
.
So
all
I
did
,
in
front
of
the
museum
,
was
get
a
cab
and
go
down
to
the
Biltmore
.
I
did
n't
feel
much
like
going
.
I
'd
made
that
damn
date
with
Sally
,
though
.
17
I
was
way
early
when
I
got
there
,
so
I
just
sat
down
on
one
of
those
leather
couches
right
near
the
clock
in
the
lobby
and
watched
the
girls
.
A
lot
of
schools
were
home
for
vacation
already
,
and
there
were
about
a
million
girls
sitting
and
standing
around
waiting
for
their
dates
to
show
up
.
Girls
with
their
legs
crossed
,
girls
with
their
legs
not
crossed
,
girls
with
terrific
legs
,
girls
with
lousy
legs
,
girls
that
looked
like
swell
girls
,
girls
that
looked
like
they
'd
be
bitches
if
you
knew
them
.
It
was
really
nice
sightseeing
,
if
you
know
what
I
mean
.
In
a
way
,
it
was
sort
of
depressing
,
too
,
because
you
kept
wondering
what
the
hell
would
happen
to
all
of
them
.
When
they
got
out
of
school
and
college
,
I
mean
.
You
figured
most
of
them
would
probably
marry
dopey
guys
.
Guys
that
always
talk
about
how
many
miles
they
get
to
a
gallon
in
their
goddam
cars
.
Guys
that
get
sore
and
childish
as
hell
if
you
beat
them
at
golf
,
or
even
just
some
stupid
game
like
ping-pong
.
Guys
that
are
very
mean
.
Guys
that
never
read
books
.
Guys
that
are
very
boring
--
But
I
have
to
be
careful
about
that
.
I
mean
about
calling
certain
guys
bores
.
I
do
n't
understand
boring
guys
.
I
really
do
n't
.
When
I
was
at
Elkton
Hills
,
I
roomed
for
about
two
months
with
this
boy
,
Harris
Mackim
.
He
was
very
intelligent
and
all
,
but
he
was
one
of
the
biggest
bores
I
ever
met
.
He
had
one
of
these
very
raspy
voices
,
and
he
never
stopped
talking
,
practically
.
He
never
stopped
talking
,
and
what
was
awful
was
,
he
never
said
anything
you
wanted
to
hear
in
the
first
place
.
But
he
could
do
one
thing
.
The
sonuvabitch
could
whistle
better
than
anybody
I
ever
heard
.
He
'd
be
making
his
bed
,
or
hanging
up
stuff
in
the
closet
--
he
was
always
hanging
up
stuff
in
the
closet
--
it
drove
me
crazy
--
and
he
'd
be
whistling
while
he
did
it
,
if
he
was
n't
talking
in
this
raspy
voice
.
He
could
even
whistle
classical
stuff
,
but
most
of
the
time
he
just
whistled
jazz
.
He
could
take
something
very
jazzy
,
like
``
Tin
Roof
Blues
,
''
and
whistle
it
so
nice
and
easy
--
right
while
he
was
hanging
stuff
up
in
the
closet
--
that
it
could
kill
you
.
Naturally
,
I
never
told
him
I
thought
he
was
a
terrific
whistler
.
I
mean
you
do
n't
just
go
up
to
somebody
and
say
,
``
You
're
a
terrific
whistler
.
''
But
I
roomed
with
him
for
about
two
whole
months
,
even
though
he
bored
me
till
I
was
half
crazy
,
just
because
he
was
such
a
terrific
whistler
,
the
best
I
ever
heard
.
So
I
do
n't
know
about
bores
.
Maybe
you
should
n't
feel
too
sorry
if
you
see
some
swell
girl
getting
married
to
them
.
They
do
n't
hurt
anybody
,
most
of
them
,
and
maybe
they
're
secretly
all
terrific
whistlers
or
something
.
Who
the
hell
knows
?
Not
me
.
Finally
,
old
Sally
started
coming
up
the
stairs
,
and
I
started
down
to
meet
her
.
She
looked
terrific
.
She
really
did
.
She
had
on
this
black
coat
and
sort
of
a
black
beret
.
She
hardly
ever
wore
a
hat
,
but
that
beret
looked
nice
.
The
funny
part
is
,
I
felt
like
marrying
her
the
minute
I
saw
her
.
I
'm
crazy
.
I
did
n't
even
like
her
much
,
and
yet
all
of
a
sudden
I
felt
like
I
was
in
love
with
her
and
wanted
to
marry
her
.
I
swear
to
God
I
'm
crazy
.
I
admit
it
.
``
Holden
!
''
she
said
.
``
It
's
marvelous
to
see
you
!
It
's
been
ages
.
''
She
had
one
of
these
very
loud
,
embarrassing
voices
when
you
met
her
somewhere
.
She
got
away
with
it
because
she
was
so
damn
good-looking
,
but
it
always
gave
me
a
pain
in
the
ass
.
``
Swell
to
see
you
,
''
I
said
.
I
meant
it
,
too
.
``
How
are
ya
,
anyway
?
''
``
Absolutely
marvelous
.
Am
I
late
?
''
I
told
her
no
,
but
she
was
around
ten
minutes
late
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
.
I
did
n't
give
a
damn
,
though
.
All
that
crap
they
have
in
cartoons
in
the
Saturday
Evening
Post
and
all
,
showing
guys
on
street
corners
looking
sore
as
hell
because
their
dates
are
late
--
that
's
bunk
.
If
a
girl
looks
swell
when
she
meets
you
,
who
gives
a
damn
if
she
's
late
?
Nobody
.
``
We
better
hurry
,
''
I
said
.
``
The
show
starts
at
two-forty
.
''
We
started
going
down
the
stairs
to
where
the
taxis
are
.
``
What
are
we
going
to
see
?
''
she
said
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
The
Lunts
.
It
's
all
I
could
get
tickets
for
.
''
``
The
Lunts
!
Oh
,
marvelous
!
''
I
told
you
she
'd
go
mad
when
she
heard
it
was
for
the
Lunts
.
We
horsed
around
a
little
bit
in
the
cab
on
the
way
over
to
the
theater
.
At
first
she
did
n't
want
to
,
because
she
had
her
lipstick
on
and
all
,
but
I
was
being
seductive
as
hell
and
she
did
n't
have
any
alternative
.
Twice
,
when
the
goddam
cab
stopped
short
in
traffic
,
I
damn
near
fell
off
the
seat
.
Those
damn
drivers
never
even
look
where
they
're
going
,
I
swear
they
do
n't
.
Then
,
just
to
show
you
how
crazy
I
am
,
when
we
were
coming
out
of
this
big
clinch
,
I
told
her
I
loved
her
and
all
.
It
was
a
lie
,
of
course
,
but
the
thing
is
,
I
meant
it
when
I
said
it
.
I
'm
crazy
.
I
swear
to
God
I
am
.
``
Oh
,
darling
,
I
love
you
too
,
''
she
said
.
Then
,
right
in
the
same
damn
breath
,
she
said
,
``
Promise
me
you
'll
let
your
hair
grow
.
Crew
cuts
are
getting
corny
.
And
your
hair
's
so
lovely
.
''
Lovely
my
ass
.
The
show
was
n't
as
bad
as
some
I
've
seen
.
It
was
on
the
crappy
side
,
though
.
It
was
about
five
hundred
thousand
years
in
the
life
of
this
one
old
couple
.
It
starts
out
when
they
're
young
and
all
,
and
the
girl
's
parents
do
n't
want
her
to
marry
the
boy
,
but
she
marries
him
anyway
.
Then
they
keep
getting
older
and
older
.
The
husband
goes
to
war
,
and
the
wife
has
this
brother
that
's
a
drunkard
.
I
could
n't
get
very
interested
.
I
mean
I
did
n't
care
too
much
when
anybody
in
the
family
died
or
anything
.
They
were
all
just
a
bunch
of
actors
.
The
husband
and
wife
were
a
pretty
nice
old
couple
--
very
witty
and
all
--
but
I
could
n't
get
too
interested
in
them
.
For
one
thing
,
they
kept
drinking
tea
or
some
goddam
thing
all
through
the
play
.
Every
time
you
saw
them
,
some
butler
was
shoving
some
tea
in
front
of
them
,
or
the
wife
was
pouring
it
for
somebody
.
And
everybody
kept
coming
in
and
going
out
all
the
time
--
you
got
dizzy
watching
people
sit
down
and
stand
up
.
Alfred
Lunt
and
Lynn
Fontanne
were
the
old
couple
,
and
they
were
very
good
,
but
I
did
n't
like
them
much
.
They
were
different
,
though
,
I
'll
say
that
.
They
did
n't
act
like
people
and
they
did
n't
act
like
actors
.
It
's
hard
to
explain
.
They
acted
more
like
they
knew
they
were
celebrities
and
all
.
I
mean
they
were
good
,
but
they
were
too
good
.
When
one
of
them
got
finished
making
a
speech
,
the
other
one
said
something
very
fast
right
after
it
.
It
was
supposed
to
be
like
people
really
talking
and
interrupting
each
other
and
all
.
The
trouble
was
,
it
was
too
much
like
people
talking
and
interrupting
each
other
.
They
acted
a
little
bit
the
way
old
Ernie
,
down
in
the
Village
,
plays
the
piano
.
If
you
do
something
too
good
,
then
,
after
a
while
,
if
you
do
n't
watch
it
,
you
start
showing
off
.
And
then
you
're
not
as
good
any
more
.
But
anyway
,
they
were
the
only
ones
in
the
show
--
the
Lunts
,
I
mean
--
that
looked
like
they
had
any
real
brains
.
I
have
to
admit
it
.
At
the
end
of
the
first
act
we
went
out
with
all
the
other
jerks
for
a
cigarette
.
What
a
deal
that
was
.
You
never
saw
so
many
phonies
in
all
your
life
,
everybody
smoking
their
ears
off
and
talking
about
the
play
so
that
everybody
could
hear
and
know
how
sharp
they
were
.
Some
dopey
movie
actor
was
standing
near
us
,
having
a
cigarette
.
I
do
n't
know
his
name
,
but
he
always
plays
the
part
of
a
guy
in
a
war
movie
that
gets
yellow
before
it
's
time
to
go
over
the
top
.
He
was
with
some
gorgeous
blonde
,
and
the
two
of
them
were
trying
to
be
very
blasé
and
all
,
like
as
if
he
did
n't
even
know
people
were
looking
at
him
.
Modest
as
hell
.
I
got
a
big
bang
out
of
it
.
Old
Sally
did
n't
talk
much
,
except
to
rave
about
the
Lunts
,
because
she
was
busy
rubbering
and
being
charming
.
Then
all
of
a
sudden
,
she
saw
some
jerk
she
knew
on
the
other
side
of
the
lobby
.
Some
guy
in
one
of
those
very
dark
gray
flannel
suits
and
one
of
those
checkered
vests
.
Strictly
Ivy
League
.
Big
deal
.
He
was
standing
next
to
the
wall
,
smoking
himself
to
death
and
looking
bored
as
hell
.
Old
Sally
kept
saying
,
``
I
know
that
boy
from
somewhere
.
''
She
always
knew
somebody
,
any
place
you
took
her
,
or
thought
she
did
.
She
kept
saying
that
till
I
got
bored
as
hell
,
and
I
said
to
her
,
``
Why
do
n't
you
go
on
over
and
give
him
a
big
soul
kiss
,
if
you
know
him
?
He
'll
enjoy
it
.
''
She
got
sore
when
I
said
that
.
Finally
,
though
,
the
jerk
noticed
her
and
came
over
and
said
hello
.
You
should
've
seen
the
way
they
said
hello
.
You
'd
have
thought
they
had
n't
seen
each
other
in
twenty
years
.
You
'd
have
thought
they
'd
taken
baths
in
the
same
bathtub
or
something
when
they
were
little
kids
.
Old
buddyroos
.
It
was
nauseating
.
The
funny
part
was
,
they
probably
met
each
other
just
once
,
at
some
phony
party
.
Finally
,
when
they
were
all
done
slobbering
around
,
old
Sally
introduced
us
.
His
name
was
George
something
--
I
do
n't
even
remember
--
and
he
went
to
Andover
.
Big
,
big
deal
.
You
should
've
seen
him
when
old
Sally
asked
him
how
he
liked
the
play
.
He
was
the
kind
of
a
phony
that
have
to
give
themselves
room
when
they
answer
somebody
's
question
.
He
stepped
back
,
and
stepped
right
on
the
lady
's
foot
behind
him
.
He
probably
broke
every
toe
in
her
body
.
He
said
the
play
itself
was
no
masterpiece
,
but
that
the
Lunts
,
of
course
,
were
absolute
angels
.
Angels
.
For
Chrissake
.
Angels
.
That
killed
me
.
Then
he
and
old
Sally
started
talking
about
a
lot
of
people
they
both
knew
.
It
was
the
phoniest
conversation
you
ever
heard
in
your
life
.
They
both
kept
thinking
of
places
as
fast
as
they
could
,
then
they
'd
think
of
somebody
that
lived
there
and
mention
their
name
.
I
was
all
set
to
puke
when
it
was
time
to
go
sit
down
again
.
I
really
was
.
And
then
,
when
the
next
act
was
over
,
they
continued
their
goddam
boring
conversation
.
They
kept
thinking
of
more
places
and
more
names
of
people
that
lived
there
.
The
worst
part
was
,
the
jerk
had
one
of
those
very
phony
,
Ivy
League
voices
,
one
of
those
very
tired
,
snobby
voices
.
He
sounded
just
like
a
girl
.
He
did
n't
hesitate
to
horn
in
on
my
date
,
the
bastard
.
I
even
thought
for
a
minute
that
he
was
going
to
get
in
the
goddam
cab
with
us
when
the
show
was
over
,
because
he
walked
about
two
blocks
with
us
,
but
he
had
to
meet
a
bunch
of
phonies
for
cocktails
,
he
said
.
I
could
see
them
all
sitting
around
in
some
bar
,
with
their
goddam
checkered
vests
,
criticizing
shows
and
books
and
women
in
those
tired
,
snobby
voices
.
They
kill
me
,
those
guys
.
I
sort
of
hated
old
Sally
by
the
time
we
got
in
the
cab
,
after
listening
to
that
phony
Andover
bastard
for
about
ten
hours
.
I
was
all
set
to
take
her
home
and
all
--
I
really
was
--
but
she
said
,
``
I
have
a
marvelous
idea
!
''
She
was
always
having
a
marvelous
idea
.
``
Listen
,
''
she
said
.
``
What
time
do
you
have
to
be
home
for
dinner
?
I
mean
are
you
in
a
terrible
hurry
or
anything
?
Do
you
have
to
be
home
any
special
time
?
''
``
Me
?
No
.
No
special
time
,
''
I
said
.
Truer
word
was
never
spoken
,
boy
.
``
Why
?
''
``
Let
's
go
ice-skating
at
Radio
City
!
''
That
's
the
kind
of
ideas
she
always
had
.
``
Ice-skating
at
Radio
City
?
You
mean
right
now
?
''
``
Just
for
an
hour
or
so
.
Do
n't
you
want
to
?
If
you
do
n't
want
to
--
''
``
I
did
n't
say
I
did
n't
want
to
,
''
I
said
.
``
Sure
.
If
you
want
to
.
''
``
Do
you
mean
it
?
Do
n't
just
say
it
if
you
do
n't
mean
it
.
I
mean
I
do
n't
give
a
darn
,
one
way
or
the
other
.
''
Not
much
she
did
n't
.
``
You
can
rent
those
darling
little
skating
skirts
,
''
old
Sally
said
.
``
Jeannette
Cultz
did
it
last
week
.
''
That
's
why
she
was
so
hot
to
go
.
She
wanted
to
see
herself
in
one
of
those
little
skirts
that
just
come
down
over
their
butt
and
all
.
So
we
went
,
and
after
they
gave
us
our
skates
,
they
gave
Sally
this
little
blue
butt-
twitcher
of
a
dress
to
wear
.
She
really
did
look
damn
good
in
it
,
though
.
I
save
to
admit
it
.
And
do
n't
think
she
did
n't
know
it
.
The
kept
walking
ahead
of
me
,
so
that
I
'd
see
how
cute
her
little
ass
looked
.
It
did
look
pretty
cute
,
too
.
I
have
to
admit
it
.
The
funny
part
was
,
though
,
we
were
the
worst
skaters
on
the
whole
goddam
rink
.
I
mean
the
worst
.
And
there
were
some
lulus
,
too
.
Old
Sally
's
ankles
kept
bending
in
till
they
were
practically
on
the
ice
.
They
not
only
looked
stupid
as
hell
,
but
they
probably
hurt
like
hell
,
too
.
I
know
mine
did
.
Mine
were
killing
me
.
We
must
've
looked
gorgeous
.
And
what
made
it
worse
,
there
were
at
least
a
couple
of
hundred
rubbernecks
that
did
n't
have
anything
better
to
do
than
stand
around
and
watch
everybody
falling
all
over
themselves
.
``
Do
you
want
to
get
a
table
inside
and
have
a
drink
or
something
?
''
I
said
to
her
finally
.
``
That
's
the
most
marvelous
idea
you
've
had
all
day
,
''
the
said
.
She
was
killing
herself
.
It
was
brutal
.
I
really
felt
sorry
for
her
.
We
took
off
our
goddam
skates
and
went
inside
this
bar
where
you
can
get
drinks
and
watch
the
skaters
in
just
your
stocking
feet
.
As
soon
as
we
sat
down
,
old
Sally
took
off
her
gloves
,
and
I
gave
her
a
cigarette
.
She
was
n't
looking
too
happy
.
The
waiter
came
up
,
and
I
ordered
a
Coke
for
her
--
she
did
n't
drink
--
and
a
Scotch
and
soda
for
myself
,
but
the
sonuvabitch
would
n't
bring
me
one
,
so
I
had
a
Coke
,
too
.
Then
I
sort
of
started
lighting
matches
.
I
do
that
quite
a
lot
when
I
'm
in
a
certain
mood
.
I
sort
of
let
them
burn
down
till
I
ca
n't
hold
them
any
more
,
then
I
drop
them
in
the
ashtray
.
It
's
a
nervous
habit
.
Then
all
of
a
sudden
,
out
of
a
clear
blue
sky
,
old
Sally
said
,
``
Look
.
I
have
to
know
.
Are
you
or
are
n't
you
coming
over
to
help
me
trim
the
tree
Christmas
Eve
?
I
have
to
know
.
''
She
was
still
being
snotty
on
account
of
her
ankles
when
she
was
skating
.
``
I
wrote
you
I
would
.
You
've
asked
me
that
about
twenty
times
.
Sure
,
I
am
.
''
``
I
mean
I
have
to
know
,
''
she
said
.
She
started
looking
all
around
the
goddam
room
.
All
of
a
sudden
I
quit
lighting
matches
,
and
sort
of
leaned
nearer
to
her
over
the
table
.
I
had
quite
a
few
topics
on
my
mind
.
``
Hey
,
Sally
,
''
I
said
.
``
What
?
''
she
said
.
She
was
looking
at
some
girl
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
``
Did
you
ever
get
fed
up
?
''
I
said
.
``
I
mean
did
you
ever
get
scared
that
everything
was
going
to
go
lousy
unless
you
did
something
?
I
mean
do
you
like
school
,
and
all
that
stuff
?
''
``
It
's
a
terrific
bore
.
''
``
I
mean
do
you
hate
it
?
I
know
it
's
a
terrific
bore
,
but
do
you
hate
it
,
is
what
I
mean
.
''
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
exactly
hate
it
.
You
always
have
to
--
''
``
Well
,
I
hate
it
.
Boy
,
do
I
hate
it
,
''
I
said
.
``
But
it
is
n't
just
that
.
It
's
everything
.
I
hate
living
in
New
York
and
all
.
Taxicabs
,
and
Madison
Avenue
buses
,
with
the
drivers
and
all
always
yelling
at
you
to
get
out
at
the
rear
door
,
and
being
introduced
to
phony
guys
that
call
the
Lunts
angels
,
and
going
up
and
down
in
elevators
when
you
just
want
to
go
outside
,
and
guys
fitting
your
pants
all
the
time
at
Brooks
,
and
people
always
--
''
``
Do
n't
shout
,
please
,
''
old
Sally
said
.
Which
was
very
funny
,
because
I
was
n't
even
shouting
.
``
Take
cars
,
''
I
said
.
I
said
it
in
this
very
quiet
voice
.
``
Take
most
people
,
they
're
crazy
about
cars
.
They
worry
if
they
get
a
little
scratch
on
them
,
and
they
're
always
talking
about
how
many
miles
they
get
to
a
gallon
,
and
if
they
get
a
brand-new
car
already
they
start
thinking
about
trading
it
in
for
one
that
's
even
newer
.
I
do
n't
even
like
old
cars
.
I
mean
they
do
n't
even
interest
me
.
I
'd
rather
have
a
goddam
horse
.
A
horse
is
at
least
human
,
for
God
's
sake
.
A
horse
you
can
at
least
--
''
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
're
even
talking
about
,
''
old
Sally
said
.
``
You
jump
from
one
--
''
``
You
know
something
?
''
I
said
.
``
You
're
probably
the
only
reason
I
'm
in
New
York
right
now
,
or
anywhere
.
If
you
were
n't
around
,
I
'd
probably
be
someplace
way
the
hell
off
.
In
the
woods
or
some
goddam
place
.
You
're
the
only
reason
I
'm
around
,
practically
.
''
``
You
're
sweet
,
''
she
said
.
But
you
could
tell
she
wanted
me
to
change
the
damn
subject
.
``
You
ought
to
go
to
a
boys
'
school
sometime
.
Try
it
sometime
,
''
I
said
.
``
It
's
full
of
phonies
,
and
all
you
do
is
study
so
that
you
can
learn
enough
to
be
smart
enough
to
be
able
to
buy
a
goddam
Cadillac
some
day
,
and
you
have
to
keep
making
believe
you
give
a
damn
if
the
football
team
loses
,
and
all
you
do
is
talk
about
girls
and
liquor
and
sex
all
day
,
and
everybody
sticks
together
in
these
dirty
little
goddam
cliques
.
The
guys
that
are
on
the
basketball
team
stick
together
,
the
Catholics
stick
together
,
the
goddam
intellectuals
stick
together
,
the
guys
that
play
bridge
stick
together
.
Even
the
guys
that
belong
to
the
goddam
Book-of-the-Month
Club
stick
together
.
If
you
try
to
have
a
little
intelligent
--
''
``
Now
,
listen
,
''
old
Sally
said
.
``
Lots
of
boys
get
more
out
of
school
than
that
.
''
``
I
agree
!
I
agree
they
do
,
some
of
them
!
But
that
's
all
I
get
out
of
it
.
See
?
That
's
my
point
.
That
's
exactly
my
goddam
point
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
do
n't
get
hardly
anything
out
of
anything
.
I
'm
in
bad
shape
.
I
'm
in
lousy
shape
.
''
``
You
certainly
are
.
''
Then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
I
got
this
idea
.
``
Look
,
''
I
said
.
``
Here
's
my
idea
.
How
would
you
like
to
get
the
hell
out
of
here
?
Here
's
my
idea
.
I
know
this
guy
down
in
Greenwich
Village
that
we
can
borrow
his
car
for
a
couple
of
weeks
.
He
used
to
go
to
the
same
school
I
did
and
he
still
owes
me
ten
bucks
.
What
we
could
do
is
,
tomorrow
morning
we
could
drive
up
to
Massachusetts
and
Vermont
,
and
all
around
there
,
see
.
It
's
beautiful
as
hell
up
there
,
It
really
is
.
''
I
was
getting
excited
as
hell
,
the
more
I
thought
of
it
,
and
I
sort
of
reached
over
and
took
old
Sally
's
goddam
hand
.
What
a
goddam
fool
I
was
.
``
No
kidding
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
have
about
a
hundred
and
eighty
bucks
in
the
bank
.
I
can
take
it
out
when
it
opens
in
the
morning
,
and
then
I
could
go
down
and
get
this
guy
's
car
.
No
kidding
.
We
'll
stay
in
these
cabin
camps
and
stuff
like
that
till
the
dough
runs
out
.
Then
,
when
the
dough
runs
out
,
I
could
get
a
job
somewhere
and
we
could
live
somewhere
with
a
brook
and
all
and
,
later
on
,
we
could
get
married
or
something
.
I
could
chop
all
our
own
wood
in
the
wintertime
and
all
.
Honest
to
God
,
we
could
have
a
terrific
time
!
Wuddaya
say
?
C'mon
!
Wuddaya
say
?
Will
you
do
it
with
me
?
Please
!
''
``
You
ca
n't
just
do
something
like
that
,
''
old
Sally
said
.
She
sounded
sore
as
hell
.
``
Why
not
?
Why
the
hell
not
?
''
``
Stop
screaming
at
me
,
please
,
''
she
said
.
Which
was
crap
,
because
I
was
n't
even
screaming
at
her
.
``
Why
can'tcha
?
Why
not
?
''
``
Because
you
ca
n't
,
that
's
all
.
In
the
first
place
,
we
're
both
practically
children
.
And
did
you
ever
stop
to
think
what
you
'd
do
if
you
did
n't
get
a
job
when
your
money
ran
out
?
We
'd
starve
to
death
.
The
whole
thing
's
so
fantastic
,
it
is
n't
even
--
''
``
It
is
n't
fantastic
.
I
'd
get
a
job
.
Do
n't
worry
about
that
.
You
do
n't
have
to
worry
about
that
.
What
's
the
matter
?
Do
n't
you
want
to
go
with
me
?
Say
so
,
if
you
do
n't
.
''
``
It
is
n't
that
.
It
is
n't
that
at
all
,
''
old
Sally
said
.
I
was
beginning
to
hate
her
,
in
a
way
.
``
We
'll
have
oodles
of
time
to
do
those
things
--
all
those
things
.
I
mean
after
you
go
to
college
and
all
,
and
if
we
should
get
married
and
all
.
There
'll
be
oodles
of
marvelous
places
to
go
to
.
You
're
just
--
''
``
No
,
there
would
n't
be
.
There
would
n't
be
oodles
of
places
to
go
to
at
all
.
It
'd
be
entirely
different
,
''
I
said
.
I
was
getting
depressed
as
hell
again
.
``
What
?
''
she
said
.
``
I
ca
n't
hear
you
.
One
minute
you
scream
at
me
,
and
the
next
you
--
''
``
I
said
no
,
there
would
n't
be
marvelous
places
to
go
to
after
I
went
to
college
and
all
.
Open
your
ears
.
It
'd
be
entirely
different
.
We
'd
have
to
go
downstairs
in
elevators
with
suitcases
and
stuff
.
We
'd
have
to
phone
up
everybody
and
tell
'em
good-by
and
send
'em
postcards
from
hotels
and
all
.
And
I
'd
be
working
in
some
office
,
making
a
lot
of
dough
,
and
riding
to
work
in
cabs
and
Madison
Avenue
buses
,
and
reading
newspapers
,
and
playing
bridge
all
the
time
,
and
going
to
the
movies
and
seeing
a
lot
of
stupid
shorts
and
coming
attractions
and
newsreels
.
Newsreels
.
Christ
almighty
.
There
's
always
a
dumb
horse
race
,
and
some
dame
breaking
a
bottle
over
a
ship
,
and
some
chimpanzee
riding
a
goddam
bicycle
with
pants
on
.
It
would
n't
be
the
same
at
all
.
You
do
n't
see
what
I
mean
at
all
.
''
``
Maybe
I
do
n't
!
Maybe
you
do
n't
,
either
,
''
old
Sally
said
.
We
both
hated
each
other
's
guts
by
that
time
.
You
could
see
there
was
n't
any
sense
trying
to
have
an
intelligent
conversation
.
I
was
sorry
as
hell
I
'd
started
it
.
``
C'mon
,
let
's
get
outa
here
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
give
me
a
royal
pain
in
the
ass
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
''
Boy
,
did
she
hit
the
ceiling
when
I
said
that
.
I
know
I
shouldn't
've
said
it
,
and
I
probably
wouldn't
've
ordinarily
,
but
she
was
depressing
the
hell
out
of
me
.
Usually
I
never
say
crude
things
like
that
to
girls
.
Boy
,
did
she
hit
the
ceiling
.
I
apologized
like
a
madman
,
but
she
would
n't
accept
my
apology
.
She
was
even
crying
.
Which
scared
me
a
little
bit
,
because
I
was
a
little
afraid
she
'd
go
home
and
tell
her
father
I
called
her
a
pain
in
the
ass
.
Her
father
was
one
of
those
big
silent
bastards
,
and
he
was
n't
too
crazy
about
me
anyhow
.
He
once
told
old
Sally
I
was
too
goddam
noisy
.
``
No
kidding
.
I
'm
sorry
,
''
I
kept
telling
her
.
``
You
're
sorry
.
You
're
sorry
.
That
's
very
funny
,
''
she
said
.
She
was
still
sort
of
crying
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
I
did
feel
sort
of
sorry
I
'd
said
it
.
``
C'mon
,
I
'll
take
ya
home
.
No
kidding
.
''
``
I
can
go
home
by
myself
,
thank
you
.
If
you
think
I
'd
let
you
take
me
home
,
you
're
mad
.
No
boy
ever
said
that
to
me
in
my
entire
life
.
''
The
whole
thing
was
sort
of
funny
,
in
a
way
,
if
you
thought
about
it
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
I
did
something
I
should
n't
have
.
I
laughed
.
And
I
have
one
of
these
very
loud
,
stupid
laughs
.
I
mean
if
I
ever
sat
behind
myself
in
a
movie
or
something
,
I
'd
probably
lean
over
and
tell
myself
to
please
shut
up
.
It
made
old
Sally
madder
than
ever
.
I
stuck
around
for
a
while
,
apologizing
and
trying
to
get
her
to
excuse
me
,
but
she
would
n't
.
She
kept
telling
me
to
go
away
and
leave
her
alone
.
So
finally
I
did
it
.
I
went
inside
and
got
my
shoes
and
stuff
,
and
left
without
her
.
I
shouldn't
've
,
but
I
was
pretty
goddam
fed
up
by
that
time
.
If
you
want
to
know
the
truth
,
I
do
n't
even
know
why
I
started
all
that
stuff
with
her
.
I
mean
about
going
away
somewhere
,
to
Massachusetts
and
Vermont
and
all
.
I
probably
wouldn't
've
taken
her
even
if
she
'd
wanted
to
go
with
me
.
She
would
n't
have
been
anybody
to
go
with
.
The
terrible
part
,
though
,
is
that
I
meant
it
when
I
asked
her
.
That
's
the
terrible
part
.
I
swear
to
God
I
'm
a
madman
.
18
When
I
left
the
skating
rink
I
felt
sort
of
hungry
,
so
I
went
in
this
drugstore
and
had
a
Swiss
cheese
sandwich
and
a
malted
,
and
then
I
went
in
a
phone
booth
.
I
thought
maybe
I
might
give
old
Jane
another
buzz
and
see
if
she
was
home
yet
.
I
mean
I
had
the
whole
evening
free
,
and
I
thought
I
'd
give
her
a
buzz
and
,
if
she
was
home
yet
,
take
her
dancing
or
something
somewhere
.
I
never
danced
with
her
or
anything
the
whole
time
I
knew
her
.
I
saw
her
dancing
once
,
though
.
She
looked
like
a
very
good
dancer
.
It
was
at
this
Fourth
of
July
dance
at
the
club
.
I
did
n't
know
her
too
well
then
,
and
I
did
n't
think
I
ought
to
cut
in
on
her
date
.
She
was
dating
this
terrible
guy
,
Al
Pike
,
that
went
to
Choate
.
I
did
n't
know
him
too
well
,
but
he
was
always
hanging
around
the
swimming
pool
.
He
wore
those
white
Lastex
kind
of
swimming
trunks
,
and
he
was
always
going
off
the
high
dive
.
He
did
the
same
lousy
old
half
gainer
all
day
long
.
It
was
the
only
dive
he
could
do
,
but
he
thought
he
was
very
hot
stuff
.
All
muscles
and
no
brains
.
Anyway
,
that
's
who
Jane
dated
that
night
.
I
could
n't
understand
it
.
I
swear
I
could
n't
.
After
we
started
going
around
together
,
I
asked
her
how
come
she
could
date
a
showoff
bastard
like
Al
Pike
.
Jane
said
he
was
n't
a
show-off
.
She
said
he
had
an
inferiority
complex
.
She
acted
like
she
felt
sorry
for
him
or
something
,
and
she
was
n't
just
putting
it
on
.
She
meant
it
.
It
's
a
funny
thing
about
girls
.
Every
time
you
mention
some
guy
that
's
strictly
a
bastard
--
very
mean
,
or
very
conceited
and
all
--
and
when
you
mention
it
to
the
girl
,
she
'll
tell
you
he
has
an
inferiority
complex
.
Maybe
he
has
,
but
that
still
does
n't
keep
him
from
being
a
bastard
,
in
my
opinion
.
Girls
.
You
never
know
what
they
're
going
to
think
.
I
once
got
this
girl
Roberta
Walsh
's
roommate
a
date
with
a
friend
of
mine
.
His
name
was
Bob
Robinson
and
he
really
had
an
inferiority
complex
.
You
could
tell
he
was
very
ashamed
of
his
parents
and
all
,
because
they
said
``
he
do
n't
''
and
``
she
do
n't
''
and
stuff
like
that
and
they
were
n't
very
wealthy
.
But
he
was
n't
a
bastard
or
anything
.
He
was
a
very
nice
guy
.
But
this
Roberta
Walsh
's
roommate
did
n't
like
him
at
all
.
She
told
Roberta
he
was
too
conceited
--
and
the
reason
she
thought
he
was
conceited
was
because
he
happened
to
mention
to
her
that
he
was
captain
of
the
debating
team
.
A
little
thing
like
that
,
and
she
thought
he
was
conceited
!
The
trouble
with
girls
is
,
if
they
like
a
boy
,
no
matter
how
big
a
bastard
he
is
,
they
'll
say
he
has
an
inferiority
complex
,
and
if
they
do
n't
like
him
,
no
matter
how
nice
a
guy
he
is
,
or
how
big
an
inferiority
complex
he
has
,
they
'll
say
he
's
conceited
.
Even
smart
girls
do
it
.
Anyway
,
I
gave
old
Jane
a
buzz
again
,
but
her
phone
did
n't
answer
,
so
I
had
to
hang
up
.
Then
I
had
to
look
through
my
address
book
to
see
who
the
hell
might
be
available
for
the
evening
.
The
trouble
was
,
though
,
my
address
book
only
has
about
three
people
in
it
.
Jane
,
and
this
man
,
Mr.
Antolini
,
that
was
my
teacher
at
Elkton
Hills
,
and
my
father
's
office
number
.
I
keep
forgetting
to
put
people
's
names
in
.
So
what
I
did
finally
,
I
gave
old
Carl
Luce
a
buzz
.
He
graduated
from
the
Whooton
School
after
I
left
.
He
was
about
three
years
older
than
I
was
,
and
I
did
n't
like
him
too
much
,
but
he
was
one
of
these
very
intellectual
guys
--
he
had
the
highest
I.Q
.
of
any
boy
at
Whooton
--
and
I
thought
he
might
want
to
have
dinner
with
me
somewhere
and
have
a
slightly
intellectual
conversation
.
He
was
very
enlightening
sometimes
.
So
I
gave
him
a
buzz
.
He
went
to
Columbia
now
,
but
he
lived
on
65th
Street
and
all
,
and
I
knew
he
'd
be
home
.
When
I
got
him
on
the
phone
,
he
said
he
could
n't
make
it
for
dinner
but
that
he
'd
meet
me
for
a
drink
at
ten
o'clock
at
the
Wicker
Bar
,
on
54th
.
I
think
he
was
pretty
surprised
to
hear
from
me
.
I
once
called
him
a
fat-assed
phony
.
I
had
quite
a
bit
of
time
to
kill
till
ten
o'clock
,
so
what
I
did
,
I
went
to
the
movies
at
Radio
City
.
It
was
probably
the
worst
thing
I
could
've
done
,
but
it
was
near
,
and
I
could
n't
think
of
anything
else
.
I
came
in
when
the
goddam
stage
show
was
on
.
The
Rockettes
were
kicking
their
heads
off
,
the
way
they
do
when
they
're
all
in
line
with
their
arms
around
each
other
's
waist
.
The
audience
applauded
like
mad
,
and
some
guy
behind
me
kept
saying
to
his
wife
,
``
You
know
what
that
is
?
That
's
precision
.
''
He
killed
me
.
Then
,
after
the
Rockettes
,
a
guy
came
out
in
a
tuxedo
and
roller
skates
on
,
and
started
skating
under
a
bunch
of
little
tables
,
and
telling
jokes
while
he
did
it
.
He
was
a
very
good
skater
and
all
,
but
I
could
n't
enjoy
it
much
because
I
kept
picturing
him
practicing
to
be
a
guy
that
roller-skates
on
the
stage
.
It
seemed
so
stupid
.
I
guess
I
just
was
n't
in
the
right
mood
.
Then
,
after
him
,
they
had
this
Christmas
thing
they
have
at
Radio
City
every
year
.
All
these
angels
start
coming
out
of
the
boxes
and
everywhere
,
guys
carrying
crucifixes
and
stuff
all
over
the
place
,
and
the
whole
bunch
of
them
--
thousands
of
them
--
singing
``
Come
All
Ye
Faithful
!
''
like
mad
.
Big
deal
.
It
's
supposed
to
be
religious
as
hell
,
I
know
,
and
very
pretty
and
all
,
but
I
ca
n't
see
anything
religious
or
pretty
,
for
God
's
sake
,
about
a
bunch
of
actors
carrying
crucifixes
all
over
the
stage
.
When
they
were
all
finished
and
started
going
out
the
boxes
again
,
you
could
tell
they
could
hardly
wait
to
get
a
cigarette
or
something
.
I
saw
it
with
old
Sally
Hayes
the
year
before
,
and
she
kept
saying
how
beautiful
it
was
,
the
costumes
and
all
.
I
said
old
Jesus
probably
would
've
puked
if
He
could
see
it
--
all
those
fancy
costumes
and
all
.
Sally
said
I
was
a
sacrilegious
atheist
.
I
probably
am
.
The
thing
Jesus
really
would
've
liked
would
be
the
guy
that
plays
the
kettle
drums
in
the
orchestra
.
I
've
watched
that
guy
since
I
was
about
eight
years
old
.
My
brother
Allie
and
I
,
if
we
were
with
our
parents
and
all
,
we
used
to
move
our
seats
and
go
way
down
so
we
could
watch
him
.
He
's
the
best
drummer
I
ever
saw
.
He
only
gets
a
chance
to
bang
them
a
couple
of
times
during
a
whole
piece
,
but
he
never
looks
bored
when
he
is
n't
doing
it
.
Then
when
he
does
bang
them
,
he
does
it
so
nice
and
sweet
,
with
this
nervous
expression
on
his
face
.
One
time
when
we
went
to
Washington
with
my
father
,
Allie
sent
him
a
postcard
,
but
I
'll
bet
he
never
got
it
.
We
were
n't
too
sure
how
to
address
it
.
After
the
Christmas
thing
was
over
,
the
goddam
picture
started
.
It
was
so
putrid
I
could
n't
take
my
eyes
off
it
.
It
was
about
this
English
guy
,
Alec
something
,
that
was
in
the
war
and
loses
his
memory
in
the
hospital
and
all
.
He
comes
out
of
the
hospital
carrying
a
cane
and
limping
all
over
the
place
,
all
over
London
,
not
knowing
who
the
hell
he
is
.
He
's
really
a
duke
,
but
he
does
n't
know
it
.
Then
he
meets
this
nice
,
homey
,
sincere
girl
getting
on
a
bus
.
Her
goddam
hat
blows
off
and
he
catches
it
,
and
then
they
go
upstairs
and
sit
down
and
start
talking
about
Charles
Dickens
.
He
's
both
their
favorite
author
and
all
.
He
's
carrying
this
copy
of
Oliver
Twist
and
so
's
she
.
I
could
've
puked
.
Anyway
,
they
fell
in
love
right
away
,
on
account
of
they
're
both
so
nuts
about
Charles
Dickens
and
all
,
and
he
helps
her
run
her
publishing
business
.
She
's
a
publisher
,
the
girl
.
Only
,
she
's
not
doing
so
hot
,
because
her
brother
's
a
drunkard
and
he
spends
all
their
dough
.
He
's
a
very
bitter
guy
,
the
brother
,
because
he
was
a
doctor
in
the
war
and
now
he
ca
n't
operate
any
more
because
his
nerves
are
shot
,
so
he
boozes
all
the
time
,
but
he
's
pretty
witty
and
all
.
Anyway
,
old
Alec
writes
a
book
,
and
this
girl
publishes
it
,
and
they
both
make
a
hatful
of
dough
on
it
.
They
're
all
set
to
get
married
when
this
other
girl
,
old
Marcia
,
shows
up
.
Marcia
was
Alec
's
fiancée
before
he
lost
his
memory
,
and
she
recognizes
him
when
he
's
in
this
store
autographing
books
.
She
tells
old
Alec
he
's
really
a
duke
and
all
,
but
he
does
n't
believe
her
and
does
n't
want
to
go
with
her
to
visit
his
mother
and
all
.
His
mother
's
blind
as
a
bat
.
But
the
other
girl
,
the
homey
one
,
makes
him
go
.
She
's
very
noble
and
all
.
So
he
goes
.
But
he
still
does
n't
get
his
memory
back
,
even
when
his
great
Dane
jumps
all
over
him
and
his
mother
sticks
her
fingers
all
over
his
face
and
brings
him
this
teddy
bear
he
used
to
slobber
around
with
when
he
was
a
kid
.
But
then
,
one
day
,
some
kids
are
playing
cricket
on
the
lawn
and
he
gets
smacked
in
the
head
with
a
cricket
ball
.
Then
right
away
he
gets
his
goddam
memory
back
and
he
goes
in
and
kisses
his
mother
on
the
forehead
and
all
.
Then
he
starts
being
a
regular
duke
again
,
and
he
forgets
all
about
the
homey
babe
that
has
the
publishing
business
.
I
'd
tell
you
the
rest
of
the
story
,
but
I
might
puke
if
I
did
.
It
is
n't
that
I
'd
spoil
it
for
you
or
anything
.
There
is
n't
anything
to
spoil
for
Chrissake
.
Anyway
,
it
ends
up
with
Alec
and
the
homey
babe
getting
married
,
and
the
brother
that
's
a
drunkard
gets
his
nerves
back
and
operates
on
Alec
's
mother
so
she
can
see
again
,
and
then
the
drunken
brother
and
old
Marcia
go
for
each
other
.
It
ends
up
with
everybody
at
this
long
dinner
table
laughing
their
asses
off
because
the
great
Dane
comes
in
with
a
bunch
of
puppies
.
Everybody
thought
it
was
a
male
,
I
suppose
,
or
some
goddam
thing
.
All
I
can
say
is
,
do
n't
see
it
if
you
do
n't
want
to
puke
all
over
yourself
.
The
part
that
got
me
was
,
there
was
a
lady
sitting
next
to
me
that
cried
all
through
the
goddam
picture
.
The
phonier
it
got
,
the
more
she
cried
.
You
'd
have
thought
she
did
it
because
she
was
kindhearted
as
hell
,
but
I
was
sitting
right
next
to
her
,
and
she
was
n't
.
She
had
this
little
kid
with
her
that
was
bored
as
hell
and
had
to
go
to
the
bathroom
,
but
she
would
n't
take
him
.
She
kept
telling
him
to
sit
still
and
behave
himself
.
She
was
about
as
kindhearted
as
a
goddam
wolf
.
You
take
somebody
that
cries
their
goddam
eyes
out
over
phony
stuff
in
the
movies
,
and
nine
times
out
of
ten
they
're
mean
bastards
at
heart
.
I
'm
not
kidding
.
After
the
movie
was
over
,
I
started
walking
down
to
the
Wicker
Bar
,
where
I
was
supposed
to
meet
old
Carl
Luce
,
and
while
I
walked
I
sort
of
thought
about
war
and
all
.
Those
war
movies
always
do
that
to
me
.
I
do
n't
think
I
could
stand
it
if
I
had
to
go
to
war
.
I
really
could
n't
.
It
would
n't
be
too
bad
if
they
'd
just
take
you
out
and
shoot
you
or
something
,
but
you
have
to
stay
in
the
Army
so
goddam
long
.
That
's
the
whole
trouble
.
My
brother
D.B
.
was
in
the
Army
for
four
goddam
years
.
He
was
in
the
war
,
too
--
he
landed
on
D-Day
and
all
--
but
I
really
think
he
hated
the
Army
worse
than
the
war
.
I
was
practically
a
child
at
the
time
,
but
I
remember
when
he
used
to
come
home
on
furlough
and
all
,
all
he
did
was
lie
on
his
bed
,
practically
.
He
hardly
ever
even
came
in
the
living
room
.
Later
,
when
he
went
overseas
and
was
in
the
war
and
all
,
he
did
n't
get
wounded
or
anything
and
he
did
n't
have
to
shoot
anybody
.
All
he
had
to
do
was
drive
some
cowboy
general
around
all
day
in
a
command
car
.
He
once
told
Allie
and
I
that
if
he
'd
had
to
shoot
anybody
,
he
wouldn't
've
known
which
direction
to
shoot
in
.
He
said
the
Army
was
practically
as
full
of
bastards
as
the
Nazis
were
.
I
remember
Allie
once
asked
him
was
n't
it
sort
of
good
that
he
was
in
the
war
because
he
was
a
writer
and
it
gave
him
a
lot
to
write
about
and
all
.
He
made
Allie
go
get
his
baseball
mitt
and
then
he
asked
him
who
was
the
best
war
poet
,
Rupert
Brooke
or
Emily
Dickinson
.
Allie
said
Emily
Dickinson
.
I
do
n't
know
too
much
about
it
myself
,
because
I
do
n't
read
much
poetry
,
but
I
do
know
it
'd
drive
me
crazy
if
I
had
to
be
in
the
Army
and
be
with
a
bunch
of
guys
like
Ackley
and
Stradlater
and
old
Maurice
all
the
time
,
marching
with
them
and
all
.
I
was
in
the
Boy
Scouts
once
,
for
about
a
week
,
and
I
could
n't
even
stand
looking
at
the
back
of
the
guy
's
neck
in
front
of
me
.
They
kept
telling
you
to
look
at
the
back
of
the
guy
's
neck
in
front
of
you
.
I
swear
if
there
's
ever
another
war
,
they
better
just
take
me
out
and
stick
me
in
front
of
a
firing
squad
.
I
would
n't
object
.
What
gets
me
about
D.B.
,
though
,
he
hated
the
war
so
much
,
and
yet
he
got
me
to
read
this
book
A
Farewell
to
Arms
last
summer
.
He
said
it
was
so
terrific
.
That
's
what
I
ca
n't
understand
.
It
had
this
guy
in
it
named
Lieutenant
Henry
that
was
supposed
to
be
a
nice
guy
and
all
.
I
do
n't
see
how
D.B
.
could
hate
the
Army
and
war
and
all
so
much
and
still
like
a
phony
like
that
.
I
mean
,
for
instance
,
I
do
n't
see
how
he
could
like
a
phony
book
like
that
and
still
like
that
one
by
Ring
Lardner
,
or
that
other
one
he
's
so
crazy
about
,
The
Great
Gatsby
.
D.B
.
got
sore
when
I
said
that
,
and
said
I
was
too
young
and
all
to
appreciate
it
,
but
I
do
n't
think
so
.
I
told
him
I
liked
Ring
Lardner
and
The
Great
Gatsby
and
all
.
I
did
,
too
.
I
was
crazy
about
The
Great
Gatsby
.
Old
Gatsby
.
Old
sport
.
That
killed
me
.
Anyway
,
I
'm
sort
of
glad
they
've
got
the
atomic
bomb
invented
.
If
there
's
ever
another
war
,
I
'm
going
to
sit
right
the
hell
on
top
of
it
.
I
'll
volunteer
for
it
,
I
swear
to
God
I
will
.

In
case
you
do
n't
live
in
New
York
,
the
Wicker
Bar
is
in
this
sort
of
swanky
hotel
,
the
Seton
Hotel
.
I
used
to
go
there
quite
a
lot
,
but
I
do
n't
any
more
.
I
gradually
cut
it
out
.
It
's
one
of
those
places
that
are
supposed
to
be
very
sophisticated
and
all
,
and
the
phonies
are
coming
in
the
window
.
They
used
to
have
these
two
French
babes
,
Tina
and
Janine
,
come
out
and
play
the
piano
and
sing
about
three
times
every
night
.
One
of
them
played
the
piano
--
strictly
lousy
--
and
the
other
one
sang
,
and
most
of
the
songs
were
either
pretty
dirty
or
in
French
.
The
one
that
sang
,
old
Janine
,
was
always
whispering
into
the
goddam
microphone
before
she
sang
.
She
'd
say
,
``
And
now
we
like
to
geeve
you
our
impression
of
Vooly
Voo
Fransay
.
Eet
ees
the
story
of
a
leetle
Fransh
girl
who
comes
to
a
beeg
ceety
,
just
like
New
York
,
and
falls
een
love
wees
a
leetle
boy
from
Brookleen
.
We
hope
you
like
eet
.
''
Then
,
when
she
was
all
done
whispering
and
being
cute
as
hell
,
she
'd
sing
some
dopey
song
,
half
in
English
and
half
in
French
,
and
drive
all
the
phonies
in
the
place
mad
with
joy
.
If
you
sat
around
there
long
enough
and
heard
all
the
phonies
applauding
and
all
,
you
got
to
hate
everybody
in
the
world
,
I
swear
you
did
.
The
bartender
was
a
louse
,
too
.
He
was
a
big
snob
.
He
did
n't
talk
to
you
at
all
hardly
unless
you
were
a
big
shot
or
a
celebrity
or
something
.
If
you
were
a
big
shot
or
a
celebrity
or
something
,
then
he
was
even
more
nauseating
.
He
'd
go
up
to
you
and
say
,
with
this
big
charming
smile
,
like
he
was
a
helluva
swell
guy
if
you
knew
him
,
``
Well
!
How
's
Connecticut
?
''
or
``
How
's
Florida
?
''
It
was
a
terrible
place
,
I
'm
not
kidding
.
I
cut
out
going
there
entirely
,
gradually
.
It
was
pretty
early
when
I
got
there
.
I
sat
down
at
the
bar
--
it
was
pretty
crowded
--
and
had
a
couple
of
Scotch
and
sodas
before
old
Luce
even
showed
up
.
I
stood
up
when
I
ordered
them
so
they
could
see
how
tall
I
was
and
all
and
not
think
I
was
a
goddam
minor
.
Then
I
watched
the
phonies
for
a
while
.
Some
guy
next
to
me
was
snowing
hell
out
of
the
babe
he
was
with
.
He
kept
telling
her
she
had
aristocratic
hands
.
That
killed
me
.
The
other
end
of
the
bar
was
full
of
flits
.
They
were
n't
too
flitty-looking
--
I
mean
they
did
n't
have
their
hair
too
long
or
anything
--
but
you
could
tell
they
were
flits
anyway
.
Finally
old
Luce
showed
up
.
Old
Luce
.
What
a
guy
.
He
was
supposed
to
be
my
Student
Adviser
when
I
was
at
Whooton
.
The
only
thing
he
ever
did
,
though
,
was
give
these
sex
talks
and
all
,
late
at
night
when
there
was
a
bunch
of
guys
in
his
room
.
He
knew
quite
a
bit
about
sex
,
especially
perverts
and
all
.
He
was
always
telling
us
about
a
lot
of
creepy
guys
that
go
around
having
affairs
with
sheep
,
and
guys
that
go
around
with
girls
'
pants
sewed
in
the
lining
of
their
hats
and
all
.
And
flits
and
Lesbians
.
Old
Luce
knew
who
every
flit
and
Lesbian
in
the
United
States
was
.
All
you
had
to
do
was
mention
somebody
--
anybody
--
and
old
Luce
'd
tell
you
if
he
was
a
flit
or
not
.
Sometimes
it
was
hard
to
believe
,
the
people
he
said
were
flits
and
Lesbians
and
all
,
movie
actors
and
like
that
.
Some
of
the
ones
he
said
were
flits
were
even
married
,
for
God
's
sake
.
You
'd
keep
saying
to
him
,
``
You
mean
Joe
Blow
's
a
flit
?
Joe
Blow
?
That
big
,
tough
guy
that
plays
gangsters
and
cowboys
all
the
time
?
''
Old
Luce
'd
say
,
``
Certainly
.
''
He
was
always
saying
``
Certainly
.
''
He
said
it
did
n't
matter
if
a
guy
was
married
or
not
.
He
said
half
the
married
guys
in
the
world
were
flits
and
did
n't
even
know
it
.
He
said
you
could
turn
into
one
practically
overnight
,
if
you
had
all
the
traits
and
all
.
He
used
to
scare
the
hell
out
of
us
.
I
kept
waiting
to
turn
into
a
flit
or
something
.
The
funny
thing
about
old
Luce
,
I
used
to
think
he
was
sort
of
flitty
himself
,
in
a
way
.
He
was
always
saying
,
``
Try
this
for
size
,
''
and
then
he
'd
goose
the
hell
out
of
you
while
you
were
going
down
the
corridor
.
And
whenever
he
went
to
the
can
,
he
always
left
the
goddam
door
open
and
talked
to
you
while
you
were
brushing
your
teeth
or
something
.
That
stuff
's
sort
of
flitty
.
It
really
is
.
I
've
known
quite
a
few
real
flits
,
at
schools
and
all
,
and
they
're
always
doing
stuff
like
that
,
and
that
's
why
I
always
had
my
doubts
about
old
Luce
.
He
was
a
pretty
intelligent
guy
,
though
.
He
really
was
.
He
never
said
hello
or
anything
when
he
met
you
.
The
first
thing
he
said
when
he
sat
down
was
that
he
could
only
stay
a
couple
of
minutes
.
He
said
he
had
a
date
.
Then
he
ordered
a
dry
Martini
.
He
told
the
bartender
to
make
it
very
dry
,
and
no
olive
.
``
Hey
,
I
got
a
flit
for
you
,
''
I
told
him
.
``
At
the
end
of
the
bar
.
Do
n't
look
now
.
I
been
saving
him
for
ya
.
''
``
Very
funny
,
''
he
said
.
``
Same
old
Caulfield
.
When
are
you
going
to
grow
up
?
''
I
bored
him
a
lot
.
I
really
did
.
He
amused
me
,
though
.
He
was
one
of
those
guys
that
sort
of
amuse
me
a
lot
.
``
How
's
your
sex
life
?
''
I
asked
him
.
He
hated
you
to
ask
him
stuff
like
that
.
``
Relax
,
''
he
said
.
``
Just
sit
back
and
relax
,
for
Chrissake
.
''
``
I
'm
relaxed
,
''
I
said
.
``
How
's
Columbia
?
Ya
like
it
?
''
``
Certainly
I
like
it
.
If
I
did
n't
like
it
I
would
n't
have
gone
there
,
''
he
said
.
He
could
be
pretty
boring
himself
sometimes
.
``
What
're
you
majoring
in
?
''
I
asked
him
.
``
Perverts
?
''
I
was
only
horsing
around
.
``
What
're
you
trying
to
be
--
funny
?
''
``
No
.
I
'm
only
kidding
,
''
I
said
.
``
Listen
,
hey
,
Luce
.
You
're
one
of
these
intellectual
guys
.
I
need
your
advice
.
I
'm
in
a
terrific
--
''
He
let
out
this
big
groan
on
me
.
``
Listen
,
Caulfield
.
If
you
want
to
sit
here
and
have
a
quiet
,
peaceful
drink
and
a
quiet
,
peaceful
conver
--
''
``
All
right
,
all
right
,
''
I
said
.
``
Relax
.
''
You
could
tell
he
did
n't
feel
like
discussing
anything
serious
with
me
.
That
's
the
trouble
with
these
intellectual
guys
.
They
never
want
to
discuss
anything
serious
unless
they
feel
like
it
.
So
all
I
did
was
,
I
started
discussing
topics
in
general
with
him
.
``
No
kidding
,
how
's
your
sex
life
?
''
I
asked
him
.
``
You
still
going
around
with
that
same
babe
you
used
to
at
Whooton
?
The
one
with
the
terrffic
--
''
``
Good
God
,
no
,
''
he
said
.
``
How
come
?
What
happened
to
her
?
''
``
I
have
n't
the
faintest
idea
.
For
all
I
know
,
since
you
ask
,
she
's
probably
the
Whore
of
New
Hampshire
by
this
time
.
''
``
That
is
n't
nice
.
If
she
was
decent
enough
to
let
you
get
sexy
with
her
all
the
time
,
you
at
least
should
n't
talk
about
her
that
way
.
''
``
Oh
,
God
!
''
old
Luce
said
.
``
Is
this
going
to
be
a
typical
Caulfield
conversation
?
I
want
to
know
right
now
.
''
``
No
,
''
I
said
,
``
but
it
is
n't
nice
anyway
.
If
she
was
decent
and
nice
enough
to
let
you
--
''
``
Must
we
pursue
this
horrible
trend
of
thought
?
''
I
did
n't
say
anything
.
I
was
sort
of
afraid
he
'd
get
up
and
leave
on
me
if
I
did
n't
shut
up
.
So
all
I
did
was
,
I
ordered
another
drink
.
I
felt
like
getting
stinking
drunk
.
``
Who
're
you
going
around
with
now
?
''
I
asked
him
.
``
You
feel
like
telling
me
?
''
``
Nobody
you
know
.
''
``
Yeah
,
but
who
?
I
might
know
her
.
''
``
Girl
lives
in
the
Village
.
Sculptress
.
If
you
must
know
.
''
``
Yeah
?
No
kidding
?
How
old
is
she
?
''
``
I
've
never
asked
her
,
for
God
's
sake
.
''
``
Well
,
around
how
old
?
''
``
I
should
imagine
she
's
in
her
late
thirties
,
''
old
Luce
said
.
``
In
her
late
thirties
?
Yeah
?
You
like
that
?
''
I
asked
him
.
``
You
like
'em
that
old
?
''
The
reason
I
was
asking
was
because
he
really
knew
quite
a
bit
about
sex
and
all
.
He
was
one
of
the
few
guys
I
knew
that
did
.
He
lost
his
virginity
when
he
was
only
fourteen
,
in
Nantucket
.
He
really
did
.
``
I
like
a
mature
person
,
if
that
's
what
you
mean
.
Certainly
.
''
``
You
do
?
Why
?
No
kidding
,
they
better
for
sex
and
all
?
''
``
Listen
.
Let
's
get
one
thing
straight
.
I
refuse
to
answer
any
typical
Caulfield
questions
tonight
.
When
in
hell
are
you
going
to
grow
up
?
''
I
did
n't
say
anything
for
a
while
.
I
let
it
drop
for
a
while
.
Then
old
Luce
ordered
another
Martini
and
told
the
bartender
to
make
it
a
lot
dryer
.
``
Listen
.
How
long
you
been
going
around
with
her
,
this
sculpture
babe
?
''
I
asked
him
.
I
was
really
interested
.
``
Did
you
know
her
when
you
were
at
Whooton
?
''
``
Hardly
.
She
just
arrived
in
this
country
a
few
months
ago
.
''
``
She
did
?
Where
's
she
from
?
''
``
She
happens
to
be
from
Shanghai
.
''
``
No
kidding
!
She
Chinese
,
for
Chrissake
?
''
``
Obviously
.
''
``
No
kidding
!
Do
you
like
that
?
Her
being
Chinese
?
''
``
Obviously
.
''
``
Why
?
I
'd
be
interested
to
know
--
I
really
would
.
''
``
I
simply
happen
to
find
Eastern
philosophy
more
satisfactory
than
Western
.
Since
you
ask
.
''
``
You
do
?
Wuddaya
mean
'philosophy
'
?
Ya
mean
sex
and
all
?
You
mean
it
's
better
in
China
?
That
what
you
mean
?
''
``
Not
necessarily
in
China
,
for
God
's
sake
.
The
East
I
said
.
Must
we
go
on
with
this
inane
conversation
?
''
``
Listen
,
I
'm
serious
,
''
I
said
.
``
No
kidding
.
Why
's
it
better
in
the
East
?
''
``
It
's
too
involved
to
go
into
,
for
God
's
sake
,
''
old
Luce
said
.
``
They
simply
happen
to
regard
sex
as
both
a
physical
and
a
spiritual
experience
.
If
you
think
I
'm

''
``
So
do
I
!
So
do
I
regard
it
as
a
wuddayacallit
--
a
physical
and
spiritual
experience
and
all
.
I
really
do
.
But
it
depends
on
who
the
hell
I
'm
doing
it
with
.
If
I
'm
doing
it
with
somebody
I
do
n't
even

''
``
Not
so
loud
,
for
God
's
sake
,
Caulfield
.
If
you
ca
n't
manage
to
keep
your
voice
down
,
let
's
drop
the
whole
--
''
``
All
right
,
but
listen
,
''
I
said
.
I
was
getting
excited
and
I
was
talking
a
little
too
loud
.
Sometimes
I
talk
a
little
loud
when
I
get
excited
.
``
This
is
what
I
mean
,
though
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
know
it
's
supposed
to
be
physical
and
spiritual
,
and
artistic
and
all
.
But
what
I
mean
is
,
you
ca
n't
do
it
with
everybody
--
every
girl
you
neck
with
and
all
--
and
make
it
come
out
that
way
.
Can
you
?
''
``
Let
's
drop
it
,
''
old
Luce
said
.
``
Do
you
mind
?
''
``
All
right
,
but
listen
.
Take
you
and
this
Chinese
babe
.
What
's
so
good
about
you
two
?
''
``
Drop
it
,
I
said
.
''
I
was
getting
a
little
too
personal
.
I
realize
that
.
But
that
was
one
of
the
annoying
things
about
Luce
.
When
we
were
at
Whooton
,
he
'd
make
you
describe
the
most
personal
stuff
that
happened
to
you
,
but
if
you
started
asking
him
questions
about
himself
,
he
got
sore
.
These
intellectual
guys
do
n't
like
to
have
an
intellectual
conversation
with
you
unless
they
're
running
the
whole
thing
.
They
always
want
you
to
shut
up
when
they
shut
up
,
and
go
back
to
your
room
when
they
go
back
to
their
room
.
When
I
was
at
Whooton
old
Luce
used
to
hate
it
--
you
really
could
tell
he
did
--
when
after
he
was
finished
giving
his
sex
talk
to
a
bunch
of
us
in
his
room
we
stuck
around
and
chewed
the
fat
by
ourselves
for
a
while
.
I
mean
the
other
guys
and
myself
.
In
somebody
else
's
room
.
Old
Luce
hated
that
.
He
always
wanted
everybody
to
go
back
to
their
own
room
and
shut
up
when
he
was
finished
being
the
big
shot
.
The
thing
he
was
afraid
of
,
he
was
afraid
somebody
'd
say
something
smarter
than
he
had
.
He
really
amused
me
.
``
Maybe
I
'll
go
to
China
.
My
sex

I
said

That
's
what

told
me
I
ought

His

I
did

I
was
thinking
.

Supposing

talk
to

''
I
put
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
Boy
,
he
amused
me
.
``
You
're
a
real
friendly
bastard
,
''
I
told
him
.
``
You
know
that
?
''
He
was
looking
at
his
wrist
watch
.
``
I
have
to
tear
,
''
he
said
,
and
stood
up
.
``
Nice
seeing
you
.
''
He
got
the
bartender
and
told
him
to
bring
him
his
check
.
``
Hey
,
''
I
said
,
just
before
he
beat
it
.
``
Did
your
father
ever
psychoanalyze
you
?
''
``
Me
?
Why
do
you
ask
?
''
``
No

Did
he
,
though
?
Has
he
?
''
``
Not
exactly

He
's
helped
me
to
adjust
myself
to
a
certain
extent
,
but
an
extensive
analysis
has
n't
been
necessary
.
Why
do
you
ask
?
''
``
No
reason
.
I
was
just
wondering
.
''
``
Well
.
Take
it
easy
,
''
he
said
.
He
was
leaving
his
tip
and
all
and
he
was
starting
to
go
.
``
Have
just
one
more
drink
,
''
I
told
him
.
``
Please
.
I
'm
lonesome
as
hell

No
kidding

''
He
said
he
could
n't
do
it
,
though
.
He
said
he
was
late
now
,
and
then
he
left
.
Old
Luce
.
He
was
strictly
a
pain
in
the
ass
,
but
he
certainly
had
a
good
vocabulary
.
He
had
the
largest
vocabulary
of
any
boy
at
Whooton
when
I
was
there
.
They
gave
us
a
test
.
20
I
kept
sitting
there
getting
drunk
and
waiting
for
old
Tina
and
Janine
to
come
out
and
do
their
stuff
,
but
they
were
n't
there
.
A
flitty-looking
guy
with
wavy
hair
came
out
and
played
the
piano
,
and
then
this
new
babe
,
Valencia
,
came
out
and
sang
.
She
was
n't
any
good
,
but
she
was
better
than
old
Tina
and
Janine
,
and
at
least
she
sang
good
songs
.
The
piano
was
right
next
to
the
bar
where
I
was
sitting
and
all
,
and
old
Valencia
was
standing
practically
right
next
to
me
.
I
sort
of
gave
her
the
old
eye
,
but
she
pretended
she
did
n't
even
see
me
.
I
probably
would
n't
have
done
it
,
but
I
was
getting
drunk
as
hell
.
When
she
was
finished
,
she
beat
it
out
of
the
room
so
fast
I
did
n't
even
get
a
chance
to
invite
her
to
join
me
for
a
drink
,
so
I
called
the
headwaiter
over
.
I
told
him
to
ask
old
Valencia
if
she
'd
care
to
join
me
for
a
drink
.
He
said
he
would
,
but
he
probably
did
n't
even
give
her
my
message
.
People
never
give
your
message
to
anybody
.
Boy
,
I
sat
at
that
goddam
bar
till
around
one
o'clock
or
so
,
getting
drunk
as
a
bastard
.
I
could
hardly
see
straight
.
The
one
thing
I
did
,
though
,
I
was
careful
as
hell
not
to
get
boisterous
or
anything
.
I
did
n't
want
anybody
to
notice
me
or
anything
or
ask
how
old
I
was
.
But
,
boy
,
I
could
hardly
see
straight
.
When
I
was
really
drunk
,
I
started
that
stupid
business
with
the
bullet
in
my
guts
again
.
I
was
the
only
guy
at
the
bar
with
a
bullet
in
their
guts
.
I
kept
putting
my
hand
under
my
jacket
,
on
my
stomach
and
all
,
to
keep
the
blood
from
dripping
all
over
the
place
.
I
did
n't
want
anybody
to
know
I
was
even
wounded
.
I
was
concealing
the
fact
that
I
was
a
wounded
sonuvabitch
.
Finally
what
I
felt
like
,
I
felt
like
giving
old
Jane
a
buzz
and
see
if
she
was
home
yet
.
So
I
paid
my
check
and
all
.
Then
I
left
the
bar
and
went
out
where
the
telephones
were
.
I
kept
keeping
my
hand
under
my
jacket
to
keep
the
blood
from
dripping
.
Boy
,
was
I
drunk
.
But
when
I
got
inside
this
phone
booth
,
I
was
n't
much
in
the
mood
any
more
to
give
old
Jane
a
buzz
.
I
was
too
drunk
,
I
guess
.
So
what
I
did
,
I
gave
old
Sally
Hayes
a
buzz
.
I
had
to
dial
about
twenty
numbers
before
I
got
the
right
one
.
Boy
,
was
I
blind
.
``
Hello
,
''
I
said
when
somebody
answered
the
goddam
phone
.
I
sort
of
yelled
it
,
I
was
so
drunk
.
``
Who
is
this
?
''
this
very
cold
lady
's
voice
said
.
``
This
is
me
.
Holden
Caulfield
.
Lem
me
speaka
Sally
,
please
.
''
``
Sally
's
asleep
.
This
is
Sally
's
grandmother
.
Why
are
you
calling
at
this
hour
,
Holden
?
Do
you
know
what
time
it
is
?
''
``
Yeah
.
Wan
na
talka
Sally
.
Very
important
.
Put
her
on
.
''
``
Sally
's
asleep
,
young
man
.
Call
her
tomorrow
.
Good
night
.
''
``
Wake
'er
up
!
Wake
'er
up
,
hey
.
Attaboy
.
''
Then
there
was
a
different
voice
.
``
Holden
,
this
is
me
.
''
It
was
old
Sally
.
``
What
's
the
big
idea
?
''
``
Sally
?
That
you
?
''
``
Yes
--
stop
screaming
.
Are

drunk

''
``
Yeah

Eve

''
``
Yes
.

're
drunk
.

to
bed
now
.
Where
are

?
Who
's
with
you
?
''
``
Sally
?
I
'll
come
over
and
trimma

,
okay
?
Okay
,

?
''
``
Yes
.
Go
to

now
.
Where
are
you
?
Who
's
with
you
?
''
``
Nobody
.
Me
,
myself
and
I
.
''
Boy
was
I
drunk
!
I
was
even
still
holding
onto
my
guts
.
``
They
got
me
.
Rocky
's
mob
got
me
.
You
know
that
?
Sally
,
you
know
that
?
''
``
I
ca
n't
hear

.
Go
to
bed
now
.
I
have
to
go
.
Call
me
tomorrow
.
''
``
Hey
,
Sally
!
You
want
me
trimma
tree
for
ya
?
Ya
want
me
to
?
Huh
?
''
``
Yes
.
Good
night
.
Go
home
and
go
to
bed
.
''
She
hung
up
on
me
.
``
G'night
.
G'night
,
Sally
baby
.
Sally
sweetheart
darling
,
''
I
said
.
Can
you
imagine
how
drunk
I
was
?
I
hung
up
too
,
then
.
I
figured
she
probably
just
came
home
from
a
date
.
I
pictured
her
out
with
the
Lunts
and
all
somewhere
,
and
that
Andover
jerk
.
All
of
them
swimming
around
in
a
goddam
pot
of
tea
and
saying
sophisticated
stuff
to
each
other
and
being
charming
and
phony
.
I
wished
to
God
I
had
n't
even
phoned
her
.
When
I
'm
drunk
,
I
'm
a
madman
.
I
stayed
in
the
damn
phone
booth
for
quite
a
while
.
I
kept
holding
onto
the
phone
,
sort
of
,
so
I
would
n't
pass
out
.
I
was
n't
feeling
too
marvelous
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
.
Finally
,
though
,
I
came
out
and
went
in
the
men
's
room
,
staggering
around
like
a
moron
,
and
filled
one
of
the
washbowls
with
cold
water
.
Then
I
dunked
my
head
in
it
,
right
up
to
the
ears
.
I
did
n't
even
bother
to
dry
it
or
anything
.
I
just
let
the
sonuvabitch
drip
.
Then
I
walked
over
to
this
radiator
by
the
window
and
sat
down
on
it
.
It
was
nice
and
warm
.
It
felt
good
because
I
was
shivering
like
a
bastard
.
It
's
a
funny
thing
,
I
always
shiver
like
hell
when
I
'm
drunk
.
I
did
n't
have
anything
else
to
do
,
so
I
kept
sitting
on
the
radiator
and
counting
these
little
white
squares
on
the
floor
.
I
was
getting
soaked
.
About
a
gallon
of
water
was
dripping
down
my
neck
,
getting
all
over
my
collar
and
tie
and
all
,
but
I
did
n't
give
a
damn
.
I
was
too
drunk
to
give
a
damn
.
Then
,
pretty
soon
,
the
guy
that
played
the
piano
for
old
Valencia
,
this
very
wavyhaired
,
flitty-looking
guy
,
came
in
to
comb
his
golden
locks
.
We
sort
of
struck
up
a
conversation
while
he
was
combing
it
,
except
that
he
was
n't
too
goddam
friendly
.
``
Hey
.
You
gon
na
see
that
Valencia
babe
when
you
go
back
in
the
bar
?
''
I
asked
him
.
``
It
's
highly
probable
,
''
he
said
.
Witty
bastard
.
All
I
ever
meet
is
witty
bastards
.
``
Listen
.
Give
her
my
compliments
.
Ask
her
if
that
goddam
waiter
gave
her
my
message
,
willya
?
''
``
Why
do
n't
you
go
home
,
Mac
?
How
old
are
you
,
anyway
?
''
``
Eighty-six
.
Listen
.
Give
her
my
compliments
.
Okay
?
''
``
Why
do
n't
you
go
home
,
Mac
?
''
``
Not
me
.
Boy
,
you
can
play
that
goddam
piano
.
''
I
told
him
.
I
was
just
flattering
him
.
He
played
the
piano
stinking
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
``
You
oughta
go
on
the
radio
,
''
I
said
.
``
Handsome
chap
like
you
.
All
those
goddam
golden
locks
.
Ya
need
a
manager
?
''
``
Go
home
,
Mac
,
like
a
good
guy
.
Go
home
and
hit
the
sack
.
''
``
No
home
to
go
to
.
No
kidding
--
you
need
a
manager
?
''
He
did
n't
answer
me
.
He
just
went
out
.
He
was
all
through
combing
his
hair
and
patting
it
and
all
,
so
he
left
.
Like
Stradlater
.
All
these
handsome
guys
are
the
same
.
When
they
're
done
combing
their
goddam
hair
,
they
beat
it
on
you
.
When
I
finally
got
down
off
the
radiator
and
went
out
to
the
hat-check
room
,
I
was
crying
and
all
.
I
do
n't
know
why
,
but
I
was
.
I
guess
it
was
because
I
was
feeling
so
damn
depressed
and
lonesome
.
Then
,
when
I
went
out
to
the
checkroom
,
I
could
n't
find
my
goddam
check
.
The
hat-check
girl
was
very
nice
about
it
,
though
.
She
gave
me
my
coat
anyway
.
And
my
``
Little
Shirley
Beans
''
record
--
I
still
had
it
with
me
and
all
.
I
gave
her
a
buck
for
being
so
nice
,
but
she
would
n't
take
it
.
She
kept
telling
me
to
go
home
and
go
to
bed
.
I
sort
of
tried
to
make
a
date
with
her
for
when
she
got
through
working
,
but
she
would
n't
do
it
.
She
said
she
was
old
enough
to
be
my
mother
and
all
.
I
showed
her
my
goddam
gray
hair
and
told
her
I
was
forty-two
--
I
was
only
horsing
around
,
naturally
.
She
was
nice
,
though
.
I
showed
her
my
goddam
red
hunting
hat
,
and
she
liked
it
.
She
made
me
put
it
on
before
I
went
out
,
because
my
hair
was
still
pretty
wet
.
She
was
all
right
.
I
did
n't
feel
too
drunk
any
more
when
I
went
outside
,
but
it
was
getting
very
cold
out
again
,
and
my
teeth
started
chattering
like
hell
.
I
could
n't
make
them
stop
.
I
walked
over
to
Madison
Avenue
and
started
to
wait
around
for
a
bus
because
I
did
n't
have
hardly
any
money
left
and
I
had
to
start
economizing
on
cabs
and
all
.
But
I
did
n't
feel
like
getting
on
a
damn
bus
.
And
besides
,
I
did
n't
even
know
where
I
was
supposed
to
go
.
So
what
I
did
,
I
started
walking
over
to
the
park
.
I
figured
I
'd
go
by
that
little
lake
and
see
what
the
hell
the
ducks
were
doing
,
see
if
they
were
around
or
not
,
I
still
did
n't
know
if
they
were
around
or
not
.
It
was
n't
far
over
to
the
park
,
and
I
did
n't
have
anyplace
else
special
to
go
to
--
I
did
n't
even
know
where
I
was
going
to
sleep
yet
--
so
I
went
.
I
was
n't
tired
or
anything
.
I
just
felt
blue
as
hell
.
Then
something
terrible
happened
just
as
I
got
in
the
park
.
I
dropped
old
Phoebe
's
record
.
It
broke-into
about
fifty
pieces
.
It
was
in
a
big
envelope
and
all
,
but
it
broke
anyway
.
I
damn
near
cried
,
it
made
me
feel
so
terrible
,
but
all
I
did
was
,
I
took
the
pieces
out
of
the
envelope
and
put
them
in
my
coat
pocket
.
They
were
n't
any
good
for
anything
,
but
I
did
n't
feel
like
just
throwing
them
away
.
Then
I
went
in
the
park
.
Boy
,
was
it
dark
.
I
've
lived
in
New
York
all
my
life
,
and
I
know
Central
Park
like
the
back
of
my
hand
,
because
I
used
to
roller-skate
there
all
the
time
and
ride
my
bike
when
I
was
a
kid
,
but
I
had
the
most
terrific
trouble
finding
that
lagoon
that
night
.
I
knew
right
where
it
was
--
it
was
right
near
Central
Park
South
and
all
--
but
I
still
could
n't
find
it
.
I
must
've
been
drunker
than
I
thought
.
I
kept
walking
and
walking
,
and
it
kept
getting
darker
and
darker
and
spookier
and
spookier
.
I
did
n't
see
one
person
the
whole
time
I
was
in
the
park
.
I
'm
just
as
glad
.
I
probably
would
've
jumped
about
a
mile
if
I
had
.
Then
,
finally
,
I
found
it
.
What
it
was
,
it
was
partly
frozen
and
partly
not
frozen
.
But
I
did
n't
see
any
ducks
around
.
I
walked
all
around
the
whole
damn
lake
--
I
damn
near
fell
in
once
,
in
fact-
-but
I
did
n't
see
a
single
duck
.
I
thought
maybe
if
there
were
any
around
,
they
might
be
asleep
or
something
near
the
edge
of
the
water
,
near
the
grass
and
all
.
That
's
how
I
nearly
fell
in
.
But
I
could
n't
find
any
.
Finally
I
sat
down
on
this
bench
,
where
it
was
n't
so
goddam
dark
.
Boy
,
I
was
still
shivering
like
a
bastard
,
and
the
back
of
my
hair
,
even
though
I
had
my
hunting
hat
on
,
was
sort
of
full
of
little
hunks
of
ice
.
That
worried
me
.
I
thought
probably
I
'd
get
pneumonia
and
die
.
I
started
picturing
millions
of
jerks
coming
to
my
funeral
and
all
.
My
grandfather
from
Detroit
,
that
keeps
calling
out
the
numbers
of
the
streets
when
you
ride
on
a
goddam
bus
with
him
,
and
my
aunts
--
I
have
about
fifty
aunts
--
and
all
my
lousy
cousins
.
What
a
mob
'd
be
there
.
They
all
came
when
Allie
died
,
the
whole
goddam
stupid
bunch
of
them
.
I
have
this
one
stupid
aunt
with
halitosis
that
kept
saying
how
peaceful
he
looked
lying
there
,
D.B
.
told
me
.
I
was
n't
there
.
I
was
still
in
the
hospital
.
I
had
to
go
to
the
hospital
and
all
after
I
hurt
my
hand
.
Anyway
,
I
kept
worrying
that
I
was
getting
pneumonia
,
with
all
those
hunks
of
ice
in
my
hair
,
and
that
I
was
going
to
die
.
I
felt
sorry
as
hell
for
my
mother
and
father
.
Especially
my
mother
,
because
she
still
is
n't
over
my
brother
Allie
yet
.
I
kept
picturing
her
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
all
my
suits
and
athletic
equipment
and
all
.
The
only
good
thing
,
I
knew
she
would
n't
let
old
Phoebe
come
to
my
goddam
funeral
because
she
was
only
a
little
kid
.
That
was
the
only
good
part
.
Then
I
thought
about
the
whole
bunch
of
them
sticking
me
in
a
goddam
cemetery
and
all
,
with
my
name
on
this
tombstone
and
all
.
Surrounded
by
dead
guys
.
Boy
,
when
you
're
dead
,
they
really
fix
you
up
.
I
hope
to
hell
when
I
do
die
somebody
has
sense
enough
to
just
dump
me
in
the
river
or
something
.
Anything
except
sticking
me
in
a
goddam
cemetery
.
People
coming
and
putting
a
bunch
of
flowers
on
your
stomach
on
Sunday
,
and
all
that
crap
.
Who
wants
flowers
when
you
're
dead
?
Nobody
.
When
the
weather
's
nice
,
my
parents
go
out
quite
frequently
and
stick
a
bunch
of
flowers
on
old
Allie
's
grave
.
I
went
with
them
a
couple
of
times
,
but
I
cut
it
out
.
In
the
first
place
,
I
certainly
do
n't
enjoy
seeing
him
in
that
crazy
cemetery
.
Surrounded
by
dead
guys
and
tombstones
and
all
.
It
was
n't
too
bad
when
the
sun
was
out
,
but
twice
--
twice
--
we
were
there
when
it
started
to
rain
.
It
was
awful
.
It
rained
on
his
lousy
tombstone
,
and
it
rained
on
the
grass
on
his
stomach
.
It
rained
all
over
the
place
.
All
the
visitors
that
were
visiting
the
cemetery
started
running
like
hell
over
to
their
cars
.
That
's
what
nearly
drove
me
crazy
.
All
the
visitors
could
get
in
their
cars
and
turn
on
their
radios
and
all
and
then
go
someplace
nice
for
dinner
--
everybody
except
Allie
.
I
could
n't
stand
it
.
I
know
it
's
only
his
body
and
all
that
's
in
the
cemetery
,
and
his
soul
's
in
Heaven
and
all
that
crap
,
but
I
could
n't
stand
it
anyway
.
I
just
wish
he
was
n't
there
.
You
did
n't
know
him
.
If
you
'd
known
him
,
you
'd
know
what
I
mean
.
It
's
not
too
bad
when
the
sun
's
out
,
but
the
sun
only
comes
out
when
it
feels
like
coming
out
.
After
a
while
,
just
to
get
my
mind
off
getting
pneumonia
and
all
,
I
took
out
my
dough
and
tried
to
count
it
in
the
lousy
light
from
the
street
lamp
.
All
I
had
was
three
singles
and
five
quarters
and
a
nickel
left
--
boy
,
I
spent
a
fortune
since
I
left
Pencey
.
Then
what
I
did
,
I
went
down
near
the
lagoon
and
I
sort
of
skipped
the
quarters
and
the
nickel
across
it
,
where
it
was
n't
frozen
.
I
do
n't
know
why
I
did
it
,
but
I
did
it
.
I
guess
I
thought
it
'd
take
my
mind
off
getting
pneumonia
and
dying
.
It
did
n't
,
though
.
I
started
thinking
how
old
Phoebe
would
feel
if
I
got
pneumonia
and
died
.
It
was
a
childish
way
to
think
,
but
I
could
n't
stop
myself
.
She
'd
feel
pretty
bad
if
something
like
that
happened
.
She
likes
me
a
lot
.
I
mean
she
's
quite
fond
of
me
.
She
really
is
.
Anyway
,
I
could
n't
get
that
off
my
mind
,
so
finally
what
I
figured
I
'd
do
,
I
figured
I
'd
better
sneak
home
and
see
her
,
in
case
I
died
and
all
.
I
had
my
door
key
with
me
and
all
,
and
I
figured
what
I
'd
do
,
I
'd
sneak
in
the
apartment
,
very
quiet
and
all
,
and
just
sort
of
chew
the
fat
with
her
for
a
while
.
The
only
thing
that
worried
me
was
our
front
door
.
It
creaks
like
a
bastard
.
It
's
a
pretty
old
apartment
house
,
and
the
superintendent
's
a
lazy
bastard
,
and
everything
creaks
and
squeaks
.
I
was
afraid
my
parents
might
hear
me
sneaking
in
.
But
I
decided
I
'd
try
it
anyhow
.
So
I
got
the
hell
out
of
the
park
,
and
went
home
.
I
walked
all
the
way
.
It
was
n't
too
far
,
and
I
was
n't
tired
or
even
drunk
any
more
.
It
was
just
very
cold
and
nobody
around
anywhere
.
21
The
best
break
I
had
in
years
,
when
I
got
home
the
regular
night
elevator
boy
,
Pete
,
was
n't
on
the
car
.
Some
new
guy
I
'd
never
seen
was
on
the
car
,
so
I
figured
that
if
I
did
n't
bump
smack
into
my
parents
and
all
I
'd
be
able
to
say
hello
to
old
Phoebe
and
then
beat
it
and
nobody
'd
even
know
I
'd
been
around
.
It
was
really
a
terrific
break
.
What
made
it
even
better
,
the
new
elevator
boy
was
sort
of
on
the
stupid
side
.
I
told
him
,
in
this
very
casual
voice
,
to
take
me
up
to
the
Dicksteins
'
.
The
Dicksteins
were
these
people
that
had
the
other
apartment
on
our
floor
.
I
'd
already
taken
off
my
hunting
hat
,
so
as
not
to
look
suspicious
or
anything
.
I
went
in
the
elevator
like
I
was
in
a
terrific
hurry
.
He
had
the
elevator
doors
all
shut
and
all
,
and
was
all
set
to
take
me
up
,
and
then
he
turned
around
and
said
,
``
They
ai
n't
in
.
They
're
at
a
party
on
the
fourteenth
floor
.
''
``
That
's
all
right
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
'm
supposed
to
wait
for
them
.
I
'm
their
nephew
.
''
He
gave
me
this
sort
of
stupid
,
suspicious
look
.
``
You
better
wait
in
the
lobby
,
fella
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'd
like
to
--
I
really
would
,
''
I
said
.
``
But
I
have
a
bad
leg
.
I
have
to
hold
it
in
a
certain
position
.
I
think
I
'd
better
sit
down
in
the
chair
outside
their
door
.
''
He
did
n't
know
what
the
hell
I
was
talking
about
,
so
all
he
said
was
``
Oh
''
and
took
me
up
.
Not
bad
,
boy
.
It
's
funny
.
All
you
have
to
do
is
say
something
nobody
understands
and
they
'll
do
practically
anything
you
want
them
to
.
I
got
off
at
our
floor
--
limping
like
a
bastard
--
and
started
walking
over
toward
the
Dicksteins
'
side
.
Then
,
when
I
heard
the
elevator
doors
shut
,
I
turned
around
and
went
over
to
our
side
.
I
was
doing
all
right
.
I
did
n't
even
feel
drunk
anymore
.
Then
I
took
out
my
door
key
and
opened
our
door
,
quiet
as
hell
.
Then
,
very
,
very
carefully
and
all
,
I
went
inside
and
closed
the
door
.
I
really
should
've
been
a
crook
.
It
was
dark
as
hell
in
the
foyer
,
naturally
,
and
naturally
I
could
n't
turn
on
any
lights
.
I
had
to
be
careful
not
to
bump
into
anything
and
make
a
racket
.
I
certainly
knew
I
was
home
,
though
.
Our
foyer
has
a
funny
smell
that
does
n't
smell
like
anyplace
else
.
I
do
n't
know
what
the
hell
it
is
.
It
is
n't
cauliflower
and
it
is
n't
perfume
--
I
do
n't
know
what
the
hell
it
is
--
but
you
always
know
you
're
home
.
I
started
to
take
off
my
coat
and
hang
it
up
in
the
foyer
closet
,
but
that
closet
's
full
of
hangers
that
rattle
like
madmen
when
you
open
the
door
,
so
I
left
it
on
.
Then
I
started
walking
very
,
very
slowly
back
toward
old
Phoebe
's
room
.
I
knew
the
maid
would
n't
hear
me
because
she
had
only
one
eardrum
.
She
had
this
brother
that
stuck
a
straw
down
her
ear
when
she
was
a
kid
,
she
once
told
me
.
She
was
pretty
deaf
and
all
.
But
my
parents
,
especially
my
mother
,
she
has
ears
like
a
goddam
bloodhound
.
So
I
took
it
very
,
very
easy
when
I
went
past
their
door
.
I
even
held
my
breath
,
for
God
's
sake
.
You
can
hit
my
father
over
the
head
with
a
chair
and
he
wo
n't
wake
up
,
but
my
mother
,
all
you
have
to
do
to
my
mother
is
cough
somewhere
in
Siberia
and
she
'll
hear
you
.
She
's
nervous
as
hell
.
Half
the
time
she
's
up
all
night
smoking
cigarettes
.
Finally
,
after
about
an
hour
,
I
got
to
old
Phoebe
's
room
.
She
was
n't
there
,
though
.
I
forgot
about
that
.
I
forgot
she
always
sleeps
in
D.B
.
's
room
when
he
's
away
in
Hollywood
or
some
place
.
She
likes
it
because
it
's
the
biggest
room
in
the
house
.
Also
because
it
has
this
big
old
madman
desk
in
it
that
D.B
.
bought
off
some
lady
alcoholic
in
Philadelphia
,
and
this
big
,
gigantic
bed
that
's
about
ten
miles
wide
and
ten
miles
long
.
I
do
n't
know
where
he
bought
that
bed
.
Anyway
,
old
Phoebe
likes
to
sleep
in
D.B
.
's
room
when
he
's
away
,
and
he
lets
her
.
You
ought
to
see
her
doing
her
homework
or
something
at
that
crazy
desk
.
It
's
almost
as
big
as
the
bed
.
You
can
hardly
see
her
when
she
's
doing
her
homework
.
That
's
the
kind
of
stuff
she
likes
,
though
.
She
does
n't
like
her
own
room
because
it
's
too
little
,
she
says
.
She
says
she
likes
to
spread
out
.
That
kills
me
.
What
's
old
Phoebe
got
to
spread
out
?
Nothing
.
Anyway
,
I
went
into
D.B
.
's
room
quiet
as
hell
,
and
turned
on
the
lamp
on
the
desk
.
Old
Phoebe
did
n't
even
wake
up
.
When
the
light
was
on
and
all
,
I
sort
of
looked
at
her
for
a
while
.
She
was
laying
there
asleep
,
with
her
face
sort
of
on
the
side
of
the
pillow
.
She
had
her
mouth
way
open
.
It
's
funny
.
You
take
adults
,
they
look
lousy
when
they
're
asleep
and
they
have
their
mouths
way
open
,
but
kids
do
n't
.
Kids
look
all
right
.
They
can
even
have
spit
all
over
the
pillow
and
they
still
look
all
right
.
I
went
around
the
room
,
very
quiet
and
all
,
looking
at
stuff
for
a
while
.
I
felt
swell
,
for
a
change
.
I
did
n't
even
feel
like
I
was
getting
pneumonia
or
anything
any
more
.
I
just
felt
good
,
for
a
change
.
Old
Phoebe
's
clothes
were
on
this
chair
right
next
to
the
bed
.
She
's
very
neat
,
for
a
child
.
I
mean
she
does
n't
just
throw
her
stuff
around
,
like
some
kids
.
She
's
no
slob
.
She
had
the
jacket
to
this
tan
suit
my
mother
bought
her
in
Canada
hung
up
on
the
back
of
the
chair
.
Then
her
blouse
and
stuff
were
on
the
seat
.
Her
shoes
and
socks
were
on
the
floor
,
right
underneath
the
chair
,
right
next
to
each
other
.
I
never
saw
the
shoes
before
.
They
were
new
.
They
were
these
dark
brown
loafers
,
sort
of
like
this
pair
I
have
,
and
they
went
swell
with
that
suit
my
mother
bought
her
in
Canada
.
My
mother
dresses
her
nice
.
She
really
does
.
My
mother
has
terrific
taste
in
some
things
.
She
's
no
good
at
buying
ice
skates
or
anything
like
that
,
but
clothes
,
she
's
perfect
.
I
mean
Phoebe
always
has
some
dress
on
that
can
kill
you
.
You
take
most
little
kids
,
even
if
their
parents
are
wealthy
and
all
,
they
usually
have
some
terrible
dress
on
.
I
wish
you
could
see
old
Phoebe
in
that
suit
my
mother
bought
her
in
Canada
.
I
'm
not
kidding
.
I
sat
down
on
old
D.B
.
's
desk
and
looked
at
the
stuff
on
it
.
It
was
mostly
Phoebe
's
stuff
,
from
school
and
all
.
Mostly
books
.
The
one
on
top
was
called
Arithmetic
Is
Fun
!
I
sort
of
opened
the
first
page
and
took
a
look
at
it
.
This
is
what
old
Phoebe
had
on
it
:
PHOEBE
WEATHERFIELD
CAULFIELD
4B-1
That
killed
me
.
Her
middle
name
is
Josephine
,
for
God
's
sake
,
not
Weatherfield
.
She
does
n't
like
it
,
though
.
Every
time
I
see
her
she
's
got
a
new
middle
name
for
herself
.
The
book
underneath
the
arithmetic
was
a
geography
,
and
the
book
under
the
geography
was
a
speller
.
She
's
very
good
in
spelling
.
She
's
very
good
in
all
her
subjects
,
but
she
's
best
in
spelling
.
Then
,
under
the
speller
,
there
were
a
bunch
of
notebooks
.
She
has
about
five
thousand
notebooks
.
You
never
saw
a
kid
with
so
many
notebooks
.
I
opened
the
one
on
top
and
looked
at
the
first
page
.
It
had
on
it
:
Bernice
meet
me
at
recess
I
have
something
very
very
important
to
tell
you
.
That
was
all
there
was
on
that
page
.
The
next
one
had
on
it
:
Why
has
south
eastern
Alaska
so
many
caning
factories
?
Because
theres
so
much
salmon
Why
has
it
valuable
forests
?
because
it
has
the
right
climate
.
What
has
our
government
done
to
make
life
easier
for
the
alaskan
eskimos
?
look
it
up
for
tomorrow
!

Shirley
you
said
you
were
sagitarius
but
your
only
taurus
bring
your
skates
when
you
come
over
to
my
house
I
sat
there
on
D.B
.
's
desk
and
read
the
whole
notebook
.
It
did
n't
take
me
long
,
and
I
can
read
that
kind
of
stuff
,
some
kid
's
notebook
,
Phoebe
's
or
anybody
's
,
all
day
and
all
night
long
.
Kid
's
notebooks
kill
me
.
Then
I
lit
another
cigarette
--
it
was
my
last
one
.
I
must
've
smoked
about
three
cartons
that
day
.
Then
,
finally
,
I
woke
her
up
.
I
mean
I
could
n't
sit
there
on
that
desk
for
the
rest
of
my
life
,
and
besides
,
I
was
afraid
my
parents
might
barge
in
on
me
all
of
a
sudden
and
I
wanted
to
at
least
say
hello
to
her
before
they
did
.
So
I
woke
her
up
.
She
wakes
up
very
easily
.
I
mean
you
do
n't
have
to
yell
at
her
or
anything
.
All
you
have
to
do
,
practically
,
is
sit
down
on
the
bed
and
say
,
``
Wake
up
,
Phoeb
,
''
and
bingo
,
she
's
awake
.
``
Holden
!
''
she
said
right
away
.
She
put
her
arms
around
my
neck
and
all
.
She
's
very
affectionate
.
I
mean
she
's
quite
affectionate
,
for
a
child
.
Sometimes
she
's
even
too
affectionate
.
I
sort
of
gave
her
a
kiss
,
and
she
said
,
``
Whenja
get
home7
'
She
was
glad
as
hell
to
see
me
.
You
could
tell
.
``
Not
so
loud
.
Just
now
.
How
are
ya
anyway
?
''
``
I
'm
fine
.
Did
you
get
my
letter
?
I
wrote
you
a
five-page
--
''
``
Yeah
--
not
so
loud
.
Thanks
.
''
She
wrote
me
this
letter
.
I
did
n't
get
a
chance
to
answer
it
,
though
.
It
was
all
about
this
play
she
was
in
in
school
.
She
told
me
not
to
make
any
dates
or
anything
for
Friday
so
that
I
could
come
see
it
.
``
How
's
the
play
?
''
I
asked
her
.
``
What
'd
you
say
the
name
of
it
was
?
''
``
'A
Christmas
Pageant
for
Americans
.
'
It
stinks
,
but
I
'm
Benedict
Arnold
.
I
have
practically
the
biggest
part
,
''
she
said
.
Boy
,
was
she
wide-awake
.
She
gets
very
excited
when
she
tells
you
that
stuff
.
``
It
starts
out
when
I
'm
dying
.
This
ghost
comes
in
on
Christmas
Eve
and
asks
me
if
I
'm
ashamed
and
everything
.
You
know
.
For
betraying
my
country
and
everything
.
Are
you
coming
to
it
?
''
She
was
sitting
way
the
hell
up
in
the
bed
and
all
.
``
That
's
what
I
wrote
you
about
.
Are
you
?
''
``
Sure
I
'm
coming
.
Certainly
I
'm
coming
.
''
``
Daddy
ca
n't
come
.
He
has
to
fly
to
California
,
''
she
said
.
Boy
,
was
she
wide-
awake
.
It
only
takes
her
about
two
seconds
to
get
wide-awake
.
She
was
sitting
--
sort
of
kneeling
--
way
up
in
bed
,
and
she
was
holding
my
goddam
hand
.
``
Listen
.
Mother
said
you
'd
be
home
Wednesday
,
''
she
said
.
``
She
said
Wednesday
.
''
``
I
got
out
early
.
Not
so
loud
.
You
'll
wake
everybody
up
.
''
``
What
time
is
it
?
They
wo
n't
be
home
till
very
late
,
Mother
said
.
They
went
to
a
party
in
Norwalk
,
Connecticut
,
''
old
Phoebe
said
.
``
Guess
what
I
did
this
afternoon
!
What
movie
I
saw
.
Guess
!
''
``
I
do
n't
know
--
Listen
.
Did
n't
they
say
what
time
they
'd
--
''
``
The
Doctor
,
''
old
Phoebe
said
.
``
It
's
a
special
movie
they
had
at
the
Lister
Foundation
.
Just
this
one
day
they
had
it
--
today
was
the
only
day
.
It
was
all
about
this
doctor
in
Kentucky
and
everything
that
sticks
a
blanket
over
this
child
's
face
that
's
a
cripple
and
ca
n't
walk
.
Then
they
send
him
to
jail
and
everything
.
It
was
excellent
.
''
``
Listen
a
second
.
Did
n't
they
say
what
time
they
'd
--
''
``
He
feels
sorry
for
it
,
the
doctor
.
That
's
why
he
sticks
this
blanket
over
her
face
and
everything
and
makes
her
suffocate
.
Then
they
make
him
go
to
jail
for
life
imprisonment
,
but
this
child
that
he
stuck
the
blanket
over
its
head
comes
to
visit
him
all
the
time
and
thanks
him
for
what
he
did
.
He
was
a
mercy
killer
.
Only
,
he
knows
he
deserves
to
go
to
jail
because
a
doctor
is
n't
supposed
to
take
things
away
from
God
.
This
girl
in
my
class
's
mother
took
us
.
Alice
Holmborg
,
She
's
my
best
friend
.
She
's
the
only
girl
in
the
whole
--
''
``
Wait
a
second
,
willya
?
''
I
said
.
``
I
'm
asking
you
a
question
.
Did
they
say
what
time
they
'd
be
back
,
or
did
n't
they
?
''
``
No
,
but
not
till
very
late
.
Daddy
took
the
car
and
everything
so
they
would
n't
have
to
worry
about
trains
.
We
have
a
radio
in
it
now
!
Except
that
Mother
said
nobody
can
play
it
when
the
car
's
in
traffic
.
''
I
began
to
relax
,
sort
of
.
I
mean
I
finally
quit
worrying
about
whether
they
'd
catch
me
home
or
not
.
I
figured
the
hell
with
it
.
If
they
did
,
they
did
.
You
should
've
seen
old
Phoebe
.
She
had
on
these
blue
pajamas
with
red
elephants
on
the
collars
.
Elephants
knock
her
out
.
``
So
it
was
a
good
picture
,
huh
?
''
I
said
.
``
Swell
,
except
Alice
had
a
cold
,
and
her
mother
kept
asking
her
all
the
time
if
she
felt
grippy
.
Right
in
the
middle
of
the
picture
.
Always
in
the
middle
of
something
important
,
her
mother
'd
lean
all
over
me
and
everything
and
ask
Alice
if
she
felt
grippy
.
It
got
on
my
nerves
.
''
Then
I
told
her
about
the
record
.
``
Listen
,
I
bought
you
a
record
,
''
I
told
her
.
``
Only
I
broke
it
on
the
way
home
.
''
I
took
the
pieces
out
of
my
coat
pocket
and
showed
her
.
``
I
was
plastered
,
''
I
said
.
``
Gim
me
the
pieces
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'm
saving
them
.
''
She
took
them
right
out
of
my
hand
and
then
she
put
them
in
the
drawer
of
the
night
table
.
She
kills
me
.
``
D.B
.
coming
home
for
Christmas
?
''
I
asked
her
.
``
He
may
and
he
may
not

Mother
said
.
It
all
depends

may
have
to

``

's

``
I
'm
not

know

What
's

do
with

kind
of

I
said
.
Boy
,
that
stuff
drives
me
crazy
.
That
goddam
Hollywood
.
``
What
'd
you
do
to
your
arm
?
''
I
asked
her
.
I
noticed
she
had
this
big
hunk
of
adhesive
tape
on
her
elbow
.
The
reason
I
noticed
it
,
her
pajamas
did
n't
have
any
sleeves
.
``
This
boy
,
Curtis
Weintraub
,
that
's
in

pushed
me
while
I
was
going
down

stairs
in
the
park

she
said
.
``
Wan
na
see
?
''
She
started
taking
the
crazy
adhesive
tape
off
her
arm
.
``
Leave
it
alone
.
Why
'd
he
push
you
down
the
stairs
?

``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
think
he
hates
me
,
''
old
Phoebe
said
.
``
This
other
girl
and
me
,
Selma
Atterbury
,
put
ink
and
stuff
all
over
his
windbreaker
.

``
That
is
n't
nice

What
are
you

a
child
,
for
God
's

``
No
,
but
every
time
I
'm
in

he
follows

He
's
always
following
me

He
gets
on
my
nerves

``
He
probably
likes
you

That
's
no
reason
to
put
ink
all
--
''
``
I
do
n't
want
him
to
like
me
,
''
she
said
.
Then
she
started
looking
at
me
funny
.
``
Holden
,
''
she
said
,
``
how
come
you
're
not
home
Wednesday
?
''
``
What
?
''
Boy
,
you
have
to
watch
her
every
minute

If

do
n't

she
's
smart
,
you
're
mad

``
How
come

she
asked
me
.
``
You
did
n't
get
kicked
out

anything

``
I
told

us
out
early

They
let
the
whole
--
''
``
You
did
get
kicked
out
!
You
did
!
''
old
Phoebe
said
.
Then
she
hit
me
on
the
leg
with
her
fist
.
She
gets
very
fisty
when
she
feels
like
it
.
``
You
did
!
Oh
,
Holden
!
''
She
had
her
hand
on
her
mouth
and
all
.
She
gets
very
emotional
,
I
swear
to
God
.
``
Who
said
I
got
kicked
out
?
Nobody
said
I
--
''
``
You
did
.
You
did
,
''
she
said
.
Then
she
smacked
me
again
with
her
fist
.
If
you
do
n't
think
that
hurts
,
you
're
crazy
.
``
Daddy
'll
kill
you
!
''
she
said
.
Then
she
flopped
on
her
stomach
on
the
bed
and
put
the
goddam
pillow
over
her
head
.
She
does
that
quite
frequently
.
She
's
a
true
madman
sometimes
.
``
Cut
it
out
,
now
,
''
I
said
.
``
Nobody
's
gon
na
kill

Nobody

C'mon

Phoeb
,
take

goddam
thing
off
your

She
would
n't
take
it
off
,
though
.
You
ca
n't
make
her
do
something
if
she
does
n't
want
to
.
All
she
kept
saying
was
,
``
Daddy
s
gon
na
kill
you
.
''
You
could
hardly
understand
her
with
that
goddam
pillow
over
her
head
.
``
Nobody
's
gon
na
kill

Use
your
head

In
the
first
place
,
I
'm
going
away
.
What
I
may
do
,
I
may
get
a
job
on
a
ranch
or
something
for
a
while

I
know
this
guy
whose
grandfather
's
got
a
ranch
in
Colorado
.
I
may
get
a
job
out
there

''
I
said
.
``
I
'll
keep
in
touch
with
you
and
all
when
I
'm
gone
,
if
I
go

C'mon
.
Take
that
off
your
head
.
C'mon
,
hey
,
Phoeb
.
Please
.
Please
,
willya
?
'
She
wouldn
t
take
it
off
,
though
I
tried
pulling
it
off
,
but
she
's
strong
as
hell
.
You
get
tired
fighting
with
her
.
Boy
,
if
she
wants
to
keep
a
pillow
over
her
head
,
she
keeps
it
.
``
Phoebe
,
please

C'mon
outa
there

''
I
kept
saying
.
``
C'mon
,
hey
.
.
.
Hey
,
Weatherfield
.
C'mon
out
.
''
She
would
n't
come
out
,
though
.
You
ca
n't
even
reason
with
her
sometimes
.
Finally
,
I
got
up
and
went
out
in
the
living
room
and
got
some
cigarettes
out
of
the
box
on
the
table
and
stuck
some
in
my
pocket
.
I
was
all
out
.
22
When
I
came
back
,
she
had
the
pillow
off
her
head
all
right
--
I
knew
she
would
--
but
she
still
would
n't
look
at
me
,
even
though
she
was
laying
on
her
back
and
all
.
When
I
came
around
the
side
of
the
bed
and
sat
down
again
,
she
turned
her
crazy
face
the
other
way
.
She
was
ostracizing
the
hell
out
of
me
.
Just
like
the
fencing
team
at
Pencey
when
I
left
all
the
goddam
foils
on
the
subway
.
``
How
's
old
Hazel
Weatherfield
?
''
I
said
.
``
You
write
any
new
stories
about
her
?
I
got
that
one
you
sent
me
right
in
my
suitcase

It
's
down
at
the
station
.
It
's
very
good

''
``
Daddy
'll
kill
you

''
Boy
,
she
really
gets
something
on
her
mind
when
she
gets
something
on
her
mind
.
``
No

he
'll
give
me
hell
again
,
and
then
he
'll
send
me
to
that
goddam
military
school
.
That
's
all
he
'll
do
to
me
.
And
in
the
first
place
,
I
wo
n't
even
be
around
.
I
'll
be
away
.
I
'll
be
--
I
'll
probably
be
in
Colorado
on
this
ranch
.
''
``
Do
n't
make
me
laugh
.
You
ca
n't
even
ride
a
horse
.
''
``
Who
ca
n't
?
Sure
I
can
.
Certainly
I
can
.
They
can
teach
you
in
about
two
minutes
,
''
I
said
.
``
Stop
picking
at
that
.
''
She
was
picking
at
that
adhesive
tape
on
her
arm
.
``
Who
gave
you
that
haircut
?
''
I
asked
her
.
I
just
noticed
what
a
stupid
haircut
somebody
gave
her
.
It
was
way
too
short
.
``
None
of
your
business
,
''
she
said
.
She
can
be
very
snotty
sometimes
.
She
can
be
quite
snotty
.
``
I
suppose
you
failed
in
every
single
subject
again
,
''
she
said
--
very
snotty
.
It
was
sort
of
funny
,
too
,
in
a
way
.
She
sounds
like
a
goddam
schoolteacher
sometimes
,
and
she
's
only
a
little
child
.
``
No
,
I
did
n't
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
passed
English
.
''
Then
,
just
for
the
hell
of
it
,
I
gave
her
a
pinch
on
the
behind
.
It
was
sticking
way
out
in
the
breeze
,
the
way
she
was
laying
on
her
side
.
She
has
hardly
any
behind
.
I
did
n't
do
it
hard
,
but
she
tried
to
hit
my
hand
anyway
,
but
she
missed
.
Then
all
of
a
sudden
,
she
said
,
``
Oh
,
why
did
you
do
it
?
''
She
meant
why
did
I
get
the
ax
again
.
It
made
me
sort
of
sad
,
the
way
she
said
it
.
``
Oh
,
God
,
Phoebe
,
do
n't
ask
me
.
I
'm
sick
of
everybody
asking
me
that
,
''
I
said
.
``
A
million
reasons
why
.
It
was
one
of
the
worst
schools
I
ever
went
to
.
It
was
full
of
phonies
.
And
mean
guys
.
You
never
saw
so
many
mean
guys
in
your
life
.
For
instance
,
if
you
were
having
a
bull
session
in
somebody
's
room
,
and
somebody
wanted
to
come
in
,
nobody
'd
let
them
in
if
they
were
some
dopey
,
pimply
guy
.
Everybody
was
always
locking
their
door
when
somebody
wanted
to
come
in
.
And
they
had
this
goddam
secret
fraternity
that
I
was
too
yellow
not
to
join
.
There
was
this
one
pimply
,
boring
guy
,
Robert
Ackley
,
that
wanted
to
get
in
.
He
kept
trying
to
join
,
and
they
would
n't
let
him
.
Just
because
he
was
boring
and
pimply
.
I
do
n't
even
feel
like
talking
about
it
.
It
was
a
stinking
school
.
Take
my
word
.
''
Old
Phoebe
did
n't
say
anything
,
but
she
was
listen
ing
.
I
could
tell
by
the
back
of
her
neck
that
she
was
listening
.
She
always
listens
when
you
tell
her
something
.
And
the
funny
part
is
she
knows
,
half
the
time
,
what
the
hell
you
're
talking
about
.
She
really
does
.
I
kept
talking
about
old
Pencey
.
I
sort
of
felt
like
it
.
``
Even
the
couple
of
nice
teachers
on
the
faculty
,
they
were
phonies
,
too
,
''
I
said
.
``
There
was
this
one
old
guy
,
Mr.
Spencer
.
His
wife
was
always
giving
you
hot
chocolate
and
all
that
stuff
,
and
they
were
really
pretty
nice
.
But
you
should
've
seen
him
when
the
headmaster
,
old
Thurmer
,
came
in
the
history
class
and
sat
down
in
the
back
of
the
room
.
He
was
always
coming
in
and
sitting
down
in
the
back
of
the
room
for
about
a
half
an
hour
.
He
was
supposed
to
be
incognito
or
something
.
After
a
while
,
he
'd
be
sitting
back
there
and
then
he
'd
start
interrupting
what
old
Spencer
was
saying
to
crack
a
lot
of
corny
jokes
.
Old
Spencer
'd
practically
kill
himself
chuckling
and
smiling
and
all
,
like
as
if
Thurmer
was
a
goddam
prince
or
something
.
''
``
Do
n't
swear
so
much
.
''
``
It
would
've
made
you
puke
,
I
swear
it
would
,
''
I
said
.
``
Then
,
on
Veterans
'
Day
.
They
have
this
day
,
Veterans
'
Day
,
that
all
the
jerks
that
graduated
from
Pencey
around
1776
come
back
and
walk
all
over
the
place
,
with
their
wives
and
children
and
everybody
.
You
should
've
seen
this
one
old
guy
that
was
about
fifty
.
What
he
did
was
,
he
came
in
our
room
and
knocked
on
the
door
and
asked
us
if
we
'd
mind
if
he
used
the
bathroom
.
The
bathroom
was
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
--
I
do
n't
know
why
the
hell
he
asked
us
.
You
know
what
he
said
?
He
said
he
wanted
to
see
if
his
initials
were
still
in
one
of
the
can
doors
.
What
he
did
,
he
carved
his
goddam
stupid
sad
old
initials
in
one
of
the
can
doors
about
ninety
years
ago
,
and
he
wanted
to
see
if
they
were
still
there
.
So
my
roommate
and
I
walked
him
down
to
the
bathroom
and
all
,
and
we
had
to
stand
there
while
he
looked
for
his
initials
in
all
the
can
doors
.
He
kept
talking
to
us
the
whole
time
,
telling
us
how
when
he
was
at
Pencey
they
were
the
happiest
days
of
his
life
,
and
giving
us
a
lot
of
advice
for
the
future
and
all
.
Boy
,
did
he
depress
me
!
I
do
n't
mean
he
was
a
bad
guy
--
he
was
n't
.
But
you
do
n't
have
to
be
a
bad
guy
to
depress
somebody
--
you
can
be
a
good
guy
and
do
it
.
All
you
have
to
do
to
depress
somebody
is
give
them
a
lot
of
phony
advice
while
you
're
looking
for
your
initials
in
some
can
door
--
that
's
all
you
have
to
do
.
I
do
n't
know
.
Maybe
it
would
n't
have
been
so
bad
if
he
had
n't
been
all
out
of
breath
.
He
was
all
out
of
breath
from
just
climbing
up
the
stairs
,
and
the
whole
time
he
was
looking
for
his
initials
he
kept
breathing
hard
,
with
his
nostrils
all
funny
and
sad
,
while
he
kept
telling
Stradlater
and
I
to
get
all
we
could
out
of
Pencey
.
God
,
Phoebe
!
I
ca
n't
explain
.
I
just
did
n't
like
anything
that
was
happening
at
Pencey
.
I
ca
n't
explain
.
''
Old
Phoebe
said
something
then
,
but
I
could
n't
hear
her
.
She
had
the
side
of
her
mouth
right
smack
on
the
pillow
,
and
I
could
n't
hear
her
.
``
What
?
''
I
said
.
``
Take
your
mouth
away
.
I
ca
n't
hear
you
with
your
mouth
that
way
.
''
``
You
do
n't
like
anything
that
's
happening
.
''
It
made
me
even
more
depressed
when
she
said
that
.
``
Yes
I
do
.
Yes
I
do
.
Sure
I
do
.
Do
n't
say
that
.
Why
the
hell
do
you
say
that
?
''
``
Because
you
do
n't
.
You
do
n't
like
any
schools
.
You
do
n't
like
a
million
things
.
You
do
n't
.
''
``
I
do
!
That
's
where
you
're
wrong
--
that
's
exactly
where
you
're
wrong
!
Why
the
hell
do
you
have
to
say
that
?
''
I
said
.
Boy
,
was
she
depressing
me
.
``
Because
you
do
n't
,
''
she
said
.
``
Name
one
thing
.
''
``
One
thing
?
One
thing
I
like
?
''
I
said
.
``
Okay
.
''
The
trouble
was
,
I
could
n't
concentrate
too
hot
.
Sometimes
it
's
hard
to
concentrate
.
``
One
thing
I
like
a
lot
you
mean
?
''
I
asked
her
.
She
did
n't
answer
me
,
though
.
She
was
in
a
cockeyed
position
way
the
hell
over
the
other
side
of
the
bed
.
She
was
about
a
thousand
miles
away
.
``
C'mon
answer
me
,
''
I
said
.
``
One
thing
I
like
a
lot
,
or
one
thing
I
just
like
?
''
``
You
like
a
lot
.
''
``
All
right
,
''
I
said
.
But
the
trouble
was
,
I
could
n't
concentrate
.
About
all
I
could
think
of
were
those
two
nuns
that
went
around
collecting
dough
in
those
beatup
old
straw
baskets
.
Especially
the
one
with
the
glasses
with
those
iron
rims
.
And
this
boy
I
knew
at
Elkton
Hills
.
There
was
this
one
boy
at
Elkton
Hills
,
named
James
Castle
,
that
would
n't
take
back
something
he
said
about
this
very
conceited
boy
,
Phil
Stabile
.
James
Castle
called
him
a
very
conceited
guy
,
and
one
of
Stabile
's
lousy
friends
went
and
squealed
on
him
to
Stabile
.
So
Stabile
,
with
about
six
other
dirty
bastards
,
went
down
to
James
Castle
's
room
and
went
in
and
locked
the
goddam
door
and
tried
to
make
him
take
back
what
he
said
,
but
he
would
n't
do
it
.
So
they
started
in
on
him
.
I
wo
n't
even
tell
you
what
they
did
to
him
--
it
's
too
repulsive
--
but
he
still
would
n't
take
it
back
,
old
James
Castle
.
And
you
should
've
seen
him
.
He
was
a
skinny
little
weak-looking
guy
,
with
wrists
about
as
big
as
pencils
.
Finally
,
what
he
did
,
instead
of
taking
back
what
he
said
,
he
jumped
out
the
window
.
I
was
in
the
shower
and
all
,
and
even
I
could
hear
him
land
outside
.
But
I
just
thought
something
fell
out
the
window
,
a
radio
or
a
desk
or
something
,
not
a
boy
or
anything
.
Then
I
heard
everybody
running
through
the
corridor
and
down
the
stairs
,
so
I
put
on
my
bathrobe
and
I
ran
downstairs
too
,
and
there
was
old
James
Castle
laying
right
on
the
stone
steps
and
all
.
He
was
dead
,
and
his
teeth
,
and
blood
,
were
all
over
the
place
,
and
nobody
would
even
go
near
him
.
He
had
on
this
turtleneck
sweater
I
'd
lent
him
.
All
they
did
with
the
guys
that
were
in
the
room
with
him
was
expel
them
.
They
did
n't
even
go
to
jail
.
That
was
about
all
I
could
think
of
,
though
.
Those
two
nuns
I
saw
at
breakfast
and
this
boy
James
Castle
I
knew
at
Elkton
Hills
.
The
funny
part
is
,
I
hardly
even
know
James
Castle
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
He
was
one
of
these
very
quiet
guys
.
He
was
in
my
math
class
,
but
he
was
way
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
and
he
hardly
ever
got
up
to
recite
or
go
to
the
blackboard
or
anything
.
Some
guys
in
school
hardly
ever
get
up
to
recite
or
go
to
the
blackboard
.
I
think
the
only
time
I
ever
even
had
a
conversation
with
him
was
that
time
he
asked
me
if
he
could
borrow
this
turtleneck
sweater
I
had
.
I
damn
near
dropped
dead
when
he
asked
me
,
I
was
so
surprised
and
all
.
I
remember
I
was
brushing
my
teeth
,
in
the
can
,
when
he
asked
me
.
He
said
his
cousin
was
coming
in
to
take
him
for
a
drive
and
all
.
I
did
n't
even
know
he
knew
I
had
a
turtleneck
sweater
.
All
I
knew
about
him
was
that
his
name
was
always
right
ahead
of
me
at
roll
call
.
Cabel
,
R.
,
Cabel
,
W.
,
Castle
,
Caulfield
--
I
can
still
remember
it
.
If
you
want
to
know
the
truth
,
I
almost
did
n't
lend
him
my
sweater
.
Just
because
I
did
n't
know
him
too
well
.
``
What
?
''
I
said
to
old
Phoebe
.
She
said
something
to
me
,
but
I
did
n't
hear
her
.
``
You
ca
n't
even
think
of
one
thing
.
''
``
Yes
,
I
can
.
Yes
,
I
can
.
''
``
Well
,
do
it
,
then
.
''
``
I
like
Allie
,
''
I
said
.
``
And
I
like
doing
what
I
'm
doing
right
now

Sitting
here
with
you
,
and
talking
,
and
thinking
about
stuff
,
and
--
''
``
Allie
's
dead

You
always

somebody
's
dead

everything
,
and
in
Heaven

then
it
is
n't
really

''
``
I
know
he
's
dead
!
Do
n't
you
think
I
know
that
?
I
can
still
like
him
,
though
,
ca
n't
I
?
Just
because
somebody
's
dead
,
you
do
n't
just
stop
liking
them
,
for
God
's
sake
--
especially
if
they
were
about
a
thousand
times
nicer
than
the
people
you
know
that
're
alive
and
all
.
''
Old
Phoebe
did
n't
say
anything
.
When
she
ca
n't
think
of
anything
to
say
,
she
does
n't
say
a
goddam
word
.
``
Anyway
,
I
like
it
now
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
mean
right
now

Sitting
here
with
you
and
just
chewing
the
fat
and
horsing

''
``
That
is
n't
anything
really
!
''
``
It
is
so
something
really
!
Certainly
it
is

Why
the
hell
is
n't
it
?

never

anything
is
anything
really

I
'm
getting
goddam
sick
of
it

``
Stop
swearing

'm

``

I
said

but
you
do

do
that
kind

when
the
goddam
trial
was
over
,
the
reporters
and
everybody
,
the
way
it
is
in
the
dirty
movies
?
How
would
you
know
you
were
n't
being
a
phony
?
The
trouble
is
,
you
would
n't
.
''
I
'm
not
too
sure
old
Phoebe
knew
what
the
hell
I
was
talking
about
.
I
mean
she
's
only
a
little
child
and
all
.
But
she
was
listening
,
at
least
.
If
somebody
at
least
listens
,
it
's
not
too
bad
.
``
Daddy
's
going
to
kill
you
.
He
's
going
to
kill
you
,
''
she
said
.
I
was
n't
listening
,
though
.
I
was
thinking
about
something
else
--
something
crazy
.
``
You
know
what
I
'd
like
to
be
?
''
I
said
.
``
You
know
what
I
'd
like
to
be
?
I
mean
if
I
had
my
goddam
choice
?
''
``
What
?
Stop
swearing
.
''
``
You
know
that
song
'If
a
body
catch
a
body
comin
'
through
the
rye
'
?
I
'd
like
--
''
``
It
's
'If
a
body
meet
a
body
coming
through
the
rye
'
!
''
old
Phoebe
said
.
``
It
's
a
poem
.
By
Robert
Burns
.
''
``
I
know
it
's
a
poem
by
Robert
Burns
.
''
She
was
right
,
though
.
It
is
``
If
a
body
meet
a
body
coming
through
the
rye
.
''
I
did
n't
know
it
then
,
though
.
``
I
thought
it
was
'If
a
body
catch
a
body
,
'
''
I
said
.
``
Anyway
,
I
keep
picturing
all
these
little
kids
playing
some
game
in
this
big
field
of
rye
and
all
.
Thousands
of
little
kids
,
and
nobody
's
around
--
nobody
big
,
I
mean
--
except
me
.
And
I
'm
standing
on
the
edge
of
some
crazy
cliff
.
What
I
have
to
do
,
I
have
to
catch
everybody
if
they
start
to
go
over
the
cliff
--
I
mean
if
they
're
running
and
they
do
n't
look
where
they
're
going
I
have
to
come
out
from
somewhere
and
catch
them
.
That
's
all
I
'd
do
all
day
.
I
'd
just
be
the
catcher
in
the
rye
and
all
.
I
know
it
's
crazy
,
but
that
's
the
only
thing
I
'd
really
like
to
be
.
I
know
it
's
crazy
.
''
Old
Phoebe
did
n't
say
anything
for
a
long
time
.
Then
,
when
she
said
something
,
all
she
said
was
,
``
Daddy
's
going
to
kill
you
.
''
``
I
do
n't
give
a
damn
if
he
does
,
''
I
said
.
I
got
up
from
the
bed
then
,
because
what
I
wanted
to
do
,
I
wanted
to
phone
up
this
guy
that
was
my
English
teacher
at
Elkton
Hills
,
Mr.
Antolini
.
He
lived
in
New
York
now
.
He
quit
Elkton
Hills
.
He
took
this
job
teaching
English
at
N.Y.U
.
``
I
have
to
make
a
phone
call
,
''
I
told
Phoebe
.
``
I
'll
be
right
back
.
Do
n't
go
to
sleep
.
''
I
did
n't
want
her
to
go
to
sleep
while
I
was
in
the
living
room
.
I
knew
she
would
n't
but
I
said
it
anyway
,
just
to
make
sure
.
While
I
was
walking
toward
the
door
,
old
Phoebe
said
,
``
Holden
!
''
and
I
turned
around
.
She
was
sitting
way
up
in
bed
.
She
looked
so
pretty
.
``
I
'm
taking
belching
lessons
from
this
girl
,
Phyllis
Margulies
,
''
she
said
.
``
Listen
.
''
I
listened
,
and
I
heard
something
,
but
it
was
n't
much
.
``
Good
,
''
I
said
.
Then
I
went
out
in
the
living
room
and
called
up
this
teacher
I
had
,
Mr.
Antolini
.
23
I
made
it
very
snappy
on
the
phone
because
I
was
afraid
my
parents
would
barge
in
on
me
right
in
the
middle
of
it
.
They
did
n't
,
though
.
Mr.
Antolini
was
very
nice
.
He
said
I
could
come
right
over
if
I
wanted
to
.
I
think
I
probably
woke
he
and
his
wife
up
,
because
it
took
them
a
helluva
long
time
to
answer
the
phone
.
The
first
thing
he
asked
me
was
if
anything
was
wrong
,
and
I
said
no
.
I
said
I
'd
flunked
out
of
Pencey
,
though
.
I
thought
I
might
as
well
tell
him
.
He
said
``
Good
God
,
''
when
I
said
that
.
He
had
a
good
sense
of
humor
and
all
.
He
told
me
to
come
right
over
if
I
felt
like
it
.
He
was
about
the
best
teacher
I
ever
had
,
Mr.
Antolini
.
He
was
a
pretty
young
guy
,
not
much
older
than
my
brother
D.B.
,
and
you
could
kid
around
with
him
without
losing
your
respect
for
him
.
He
was
the
one
that
finally
picked
up
that
boy
that
jumped
out
the
window
I
told
you
about
,
James
Castle
.
Old
Mr.
Antolini
felt
his
pulse
and
all
,
and
then
he
took
off
his
coat
and
put
it
over
James
Castle
and
carried
him
all
the
way
over
to
the
infirmary
.
He
did
n't
even
give
a
damn
if
his
coat
got
all
bloody
.
When
I
got
back
to
D.B
.
's
room
,
old
Phoebe
'd
turned
the
radio
on
.
This
dance
music
was
coming
out
.
She
'd
turned
it
on
low
,
though
,
so
the
maid
would
n't
hear
it
.
You
should
've
seen
her
.
She
was
sitting
smack
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
,
outside
the
covers
,
with
her
legs
folded
like
one
of
those
Yogi
guys
.
She
was
listening
to
the
music
.
She
kills
me
.
``
C'mon
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
feel
like
dancing
?
''
I
taught
her
how
to
dance
and
all
when
she
was
a
tiny
little
kid
.
She
's
a
very
good
dancer
.
I
mean
I
just
taught
her
a
few
things
.
She
learned
it
mostly
by
herself
.
You
ca
n't
teach
somebody
how
to
really
dance
.
``
You
have
shoes
on
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'll
take
'em
off
.
C'mon
.
''
She
practically
jumped
off
the
bed
,
and
then
she
waited
while
I
took
my
shoes
off
,
and
then
I
danced
with
her
for
a
while
.
She
's
really
damn
good
.
I
do
n't
like
people
that
dance
with
little
kids
,
because
most
of
the
time
it
looks
terrible
.
I
mean
if
you
're
out
at
a
restaurant
somewhere
and
you
see
some
old
guy
take
his
little
kid
out
on
the
dance
floor
.
Usually
they
keep
yanking
the
kid
's
dress
up
in
the
back
by
mistake
,
and
the
kid
ca
n't
dance
worth
a
damn
anyway
,
and
it
looks
terrible
,
but
I
do
n't
do
it
out
in
public
with
Phoebe
or
anything
.
We
just
horse
around
in
the
house
.
It
's
different
with
her
anyway
,
because
she
can
dance
.
She
can
follow
anything
you
do
.
I
mean
if
you
hold
her
in
close
as
hell
so
that
it
does
n't
matter
that
your
legs
are
so
much
longer
.
She
stays
right
with
you
.
You
can
cross
over
,
or
do
some
corny
dips
,
or
even
jitterbug
a
little
,
and
she
stays
right
with
you
.
You
can
even
tango
,
for
God
's
sake
.
We
danced
about
four
numbers
.
In
between
numbers
she
's
funny
as
hell
.
She
stays
right
in
position
.
She
wo
n't
even
talk
or
anything
.
You
both
have
to
stay
right
in
position
and
wait
for
the
orchestra
to
start
playing
again
.
That
kills
me
.
You
're
not
supposed
to
laugh
or
anything
,
either
.
Anyway
,
we
danced
about
four
numbers
,
and
then
I
turned
off
the
radio
.
Old
Phoebe
jumped
back
in
bed
and
got
under
the
covers
.
``
I
'm
improving
,
are
n't
I
?
''
she
asked
me
.
``
And
how
,
''
I
said
.
I
sat
down
next
to
her
on
the
bed
again
.
I
was
sort
of
out
of
breath
.
I
was
smoking
so
damn
much
,
I
had
hardly
any
wind
.
She
was
n't
even
out
of
breath
.
``
Feel
my
forehead
,
''
she
said
all
of
a
sudden
.
``
Why
?
''
``
Feel
it
.
Just
feel
it
once
.
''
I
felt
it
.
I
did
n't
feel
anything
,
though
.
``
Does
it
feel
very
feverish
?
''
she
said
.
``
No
.
Is
it
supposed
to
?
''
``
Yes
--
I
'm
making
it
.
Feel
it
again
.
''
I
felt
it
again
,
and
I
still
did
n't
feel
anything
,
but
I
said
,
``
I
think
it
's
starting
to
,
now
.
''
I
did
n't
want
her
to
get
a
goddam
inferiority
complex
.
She
nodded
.
``
I
can
make
it
go
up
to
over
the
thermoneter
.
''
``
Thermometer
.
Who
said
so
?
''
``
Alice
Holmborg
showed
me
how
.
You
cross
your
legs
and
hold
your
breath
and
think
of
something
very
,
very
hot
.
A
radiator
or
something
.
Then
your
whole
forehead
gets
so
hot
you
can
burn
somebody
's
hand
.
''
That
killed
me
.
I
pulled
my
hand
away
from
her
forehead
,
like
I
was
in
terrific
danger
.
``
Thanks
for
telling
me
,
''
I
said
.
``
Oh
,
I
wouldn't
've
burned
your
hand
.
I'd
've
stopped
before
it
got
too
--
Shhh
!
''
Then
,
quick
as
hell
,
she
sat
way
the
hell
up
in
bed
.
She
scared
hell
out
of
me
when
she
did
that
.
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
I
said
.
``
The
front
door
!
''
she
said
in
this
loud
whisper
.
``
It
's
them
!
''
I
quick
jumped
up
and
ran
over
and
turned
off
the
light
over
the
desk
.
Then
I
jammed
out
my
cigarette
on
my
shoe
and
put
it
in
my
pocket
.
Then
I
fanned
hell
out
of
the
air
,
to
get
the
smoke
out
--
I
should
n't
even
have
been
smoking
,
for
God
's
sake
.
Then
I
grabbed
my
shoes
and
got
in
the
closet
and
shut
the
door
.
Boy
,
my
heart
was
beating
like
a
bastard
.
I
heard
my
mother
come
in
the
room
.
``
Phoebe
?
''
she
said
.
``
Now
,
stop
that
.
I
saw
the
light
,
young
lady
.
''
``
Hello
!
''
I
heard
old
Phoebe
say
.
``
I
could
n't
sleep
.
Did
you
have
a
good
time
?
''
``
Marvelous
,
''
my
mother
said
,
but
you
could
tell
she
did
n't
mean
it
.
She
does
n't
enjoy
herself
much
when
she
goes
out
.
``
Why
are
you
awake
,
may
I
ask
?
Were
you
warm
enough
?
''
``
I
was
warm
enough
,
I
just
could
n't
sleep
.
''
``
Phoebe
,
have
you
been
smoking
a
cigarette
in
here
?
Tell
me
the
truth
,
please
,
young
lady
.
''
``
What
?
''
old
Phoebe
said
.
``
You
heard
me
.
''
``
I
just
lit
one
for
one
second
.
I
just
took
one
puff
.
Then
I
threw
it
out
the
window
.
''
``
Why
,
may
I
ask
?
''
``
I
could
n't
sleep
.
''
``
I
do
n't
like
that
,
Phoebe
.
I
do
n't
like
that
at
all
,
''
my
mother
said
.
``
Do
you
want
another
blanket
?
''
``
No
,
thanks
.
G'night
!
''
old
Phoebe
said
.
She
was
trying
to
get
rid
of
her
,
you
could
tell
.
``
How
was
the
movie
?
''
my
mother
said
.
``
Excellent
.
Except
Alice
's
mother
.
She
kept
leaning
over
and
asking
her
if
she
felt
grippy
during
the
whole
entire
movie
.
We
took
a
taxi
home
.
''
``
Let
me
feel
your
forehead
.
''
``
I
did
n't
catch
anything
.
She
did
n't
have
anything
.
It
was
just
her
mother
.
''
``
Well
.
Go
to
sleep
now
.
How
was
your
dinner
?
''
``
Lousy
,
''
Phoebe
said
.
``
You
heard
what
your
father
said
about
using
that
word
.
What
was
lousy
about
it
?
You
had
a
lovely
lamb
chop
.
I
walked
all
over
Lexington
Avenue
just
to
--
''
``
The
lamb
chop
was
all
right
,
but
Charlene
always
breathes
on
me
whenever
she
puts
something
down
.
She
breathes
all
over
the
food
and
everything
.
She
breathes
on
everything
.
''
``
Well
.
Go
to
sleep
.
Give
Mother
a
kiss
.
Did
you
say
your
prayers
?
''
``
I
said
them
in
the
bathroom
.
G'night
!
''
``
Good
night
.
Go
right
to
sleep
now
.
I
have
a
splitting
headache
,
''
my
mother
said
.
She
gets
headaches
quite
frequently
.
She
really
does
.
``
Take
a
few
aspirins
,
''
old
Phoebe
said
.
``
Holden
'll
be
home
on
Wednesday
,
wo
n't
he
?
''
``
So
far
as
I
know
.
Get
under
there
,
now
.
Way
down
.
''
I
heard
my
mother
go
out
and
close
the
door
.
I
waited
a
couple
of
minutes
.
Then
I
came
out
of
the
closet
.
I
bumped
smack
into
old
Phoebe
when
I
did
it
,
because
it
was
so
dark
and
she
was
out
of
bed
and
coming
to
tell
me
.
``
I
hurt
you
?
''
I
said
.
You
had
to
whisper
now
,
because
they
were
both
home
.
``
I
got
ta
get
a
move
on
,
''
I
said
.
I
found
the
edge
of
the
bed
in
the
dark
and
sat
down
on
it
and
started
putting
on
my
shoes
.
I
was
pretty
nervous
.
I
admit
it
.
``
Do
n't
go
now
,
''
Phoebe
whispered
.
``
Wait
'll
they
're
asleep
!
''
``
No
.
Now
.
Now
's
the
best
time
,
''
I
said
.
``
She
'll
be
in
the
bathroom
and
Daddy
'll
turn
on
the
news
or
something
.
Now
's
the
best
time
.
''
I
could
hardly
tie
my
shoelaces
,
I
was
so
damn
nervous
.
Not
that
they
would
've
killed
me
or
anything
if
they
'd
caught
me
home
,
but
it
would
've
been
very
unpleasant
and
all
.
``
Where
the
hell
are
ya
?
''
I
said
to
old
Phoebe
.
It
was
so
dark
I
could
n't
see
her
.
``
Here
.
''
She
was
standing
right
next
to
me
.
I
did
n't
even
see
her
.
``
I
got
my
damn
bags
at
the
station
,
''
I
said
.
``
Listen
.
You
got
any
dough
,
Phoeb
?
I
'm
practically
broke
.
''
``
Just
my
Christmas
dough
.
For
presents
and
all
.
I
have
n't
done
any
shopping
at
all
yet
.
''
``
Oh
.
''
I
did
n't
want
to
take
her
Christmas
dough
.
``
You
want
some
?
''
she
said
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
take
your
Christmas
dough
.
''
``
I
can
lend
you
some
,
''
she
said
.
Then
I
heard
her
over
at
D.B
.
's
desk
,
opening
a
million
drawers
and
feeling
around
with
her
hand
.
It
was
pitch-black
,
it
was
so
dark
in
the
room
.
``
If
you
go
away
,
you
wo
n't
see
me
in
the
play
,
''
she
said
.
Her
voice
sounded
funny
when
she
said
it
.
``
Yes
,
I
will
.
I
wo
n't
go
way
before
that
.
You
think
I
wan
na
miss
the
play
?
''
I
said
.
``
What
I
'll
do
,
I
'll
probably
stay
at
Mr.
Antolini
's
house
till
maybe
Tuesday
night
.
Then
I
'll
come
home
.
If
I
get
a
chance
,
I
'll
phone
ya
.
''
``
Here
,
''
old
Phoebe
said
.
She
was
trying
to
give
me
the
dough
,
but
she
could
n't
find
my
hand
.
``
Where
?
''
She
put
the
dough
in
my
hand
.
``
Hey
,
I
do
n't
need
all
this
,
''
I
said
.
``
Just
give
me
two
bucks
,
is
all
.
No
kidding
--
Here
.
''
I
tried
to
give
it
back
to
her
,
but
she
would
n't
take
it
.
``
You
can
take
it
all
.
You
can
pay
me
back
.
Bring
it
to
the
play
.
''
``
How
much
is
it
,
for
God
's
sake
?
''
``
Eight
dollars
and
eighty-five
cents
.
Sixty-five
cents
.
I
spent
some
.
''
Then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
I
started
to
cry
.
I
could
n't
help
it
.
I
did
it
so
nobody
could
hear
me
,
but
I
did
it
.
It
scared
hell
out
of
old
Phoebe
when
I
started
doing
it
,
and
she
came
over
and
tried
to
make
me
stop
,
but
once
you
get
started
,
you
ca
n't
just
stop
on
a
goddam
dime
.
I
was
still
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
when
I
did
it
,
and
she
put
her
old
arm
around
my
neck
,
and
I
put
my
arm
around
her
,
too
,
but
I
still
could
n't
stop
for
a
long
time
.
I
thought
I
was
going
to
choke
to
death
or
something
.
Boy
,
I
scared
hell
out
of
poor
old
Phoebe
.
The
damn
window
was
open
and
everything
,
and
I
could
feel
her
shivering
and
all
,
because
all
she
had
on
was
her
pajamas
.
I
tried
to
make
her
get
back
in
bed
,
but
she
would
n't
go
.
Finally
I
stopped
.
But
it
certainly
took
me
a
long
,
long
time
.
Then
I
finished
buttoning
my
coat
and
all
.
I
told
her
I
'd
keep
in
touch
with
her
.
She
told
me
I
could
sleep
with
her
if
I
wanted
to
,
but
I
said
no
,
that
I
'd
better
beat
it
,
that
Mr.
Antolini
was
waiting
for
me
and
all
.
Then
I
took
my
hunting
hat
out
of
my
coat
pocket
and
gave
it
to
her
.
She
likes
those
kind
of
crazy
hats
.
She
did
n't
want
to
take
it
,
but
I
made
her
.
I
'll
bet
she
slept
with
it
on
.
She
really
likes
those
kind
of
hats
.
Then
I
told
her
again
I
'd
give
her
a
buzz
if
I
got
a
chance
,
and
then
I
left
.
It
was
a
helluva
lot
easier
getting
out
of
the
house
than
it
was
getting
in
,
for
some
reason
.
For
one
thing
,
I
did
n't
give
much
of
a
damn
any
more
if
they
caught
me
.
I
really
did
n't
.
I
figured
if
they
caught
me
,
they
caught
me
.
I
almost
wished
they
did
,
in
a
way
.
I
walked
all
the
way
downstairs
,
instead
of
taking
the
elevator
.
I
went
down
the
back
stairs
.
I
nearly
broke
my
neck
on
about
ten
million
garbage
pails
,
but
I
got
out
all
right
.
The
elevator
boy
did
n't
even
see
me
.
He
probably
still
thinks
I
'm
up
at
the
Dicksteins
'
.
24
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Antolini
had
this
very
swanky
apartment
over
on
Sutton
Place
,
with
two
steps
that
you
go
down
to
get
in
the
living
room
,
and
a
bar
and
all
.
I
'd
been
there
quite
a
few
times
,
because
after
I
left
Elkton
Hills
Mr.
Antoilni
came
up
to
our
house
for
dinner
quite
frequently
to
find
out
how
I
was
getting
along
.
He
was
n't
married
then
.
Then
when
he
got
married
,
I
used
to
play
tennis
with
he
and
Mrs.
Antolini
quite
frequently
,
out
at
the
West
Side
Tennis
Club
,
in
Forest
Hills
,
Long
Island
.
Mrs.
Antolini
,
belonged
there
.
She
was
lousy
with
dough
.
She
was
about
sixty
years
older
than
Mr.
Antolini
,
but
they
seemed
to
get
along
quite
well
.
For
one
thing
,
they
were
both
very
intellectual
,
especially
Mr.
Antolini
except
that
he
was
more
witty
than
intellectual
when
you
were
with
him
,
sort
of
like
D.B
.
Mrs.
Antolini
was
mostly
serious
.
She
had
asthma
pretty
bad
.
They
both
read
all
D.B
.
's
stories
--
Mrs.
Antolini
,
too
--
and
when
D.B
.
went
to
Hollywood
,
Mr.
Antolini
phoned
him
up
and
told
him
not
to
go
.
He
went
anyway
,
though
.
Mr.
Antolini
said
that
anybody
that
could
write
like
D.B
.
had
no
business
going
out
to
Hollywood
.
That
's
exactly
what
I
said
,
practically
.
I
would
have
walked
down
to
their
house
,
because
I
did
n't
want
to
spend
any
of
Phoebe
's
Christmas
dough
that
I
did
n't
have
to
,
but
I
felt
funny
when
I
got
outside
.
Sort
of
dizzy
.
So
I
took
a
cab
.
I
did
n't
want
to
,
but
I
did
.
I
had
a
helluva
time
even
finding
a
cab
.
Old
Mr.
Antolini
answered
the
door
when
I
rang
the
bell
--
after
the
elevator
boy
finally
let
me
up
,
the
bastard
.
He
had
on
his
bathrobe
and
slippers
,
and
he
had
a
highball
in
one
hand
.
He
was
a
pretty
sophisticated
guy
,
and
he
was
a
pretty
heavy
drinker
.
``
Holden
,
m'boy
!
''
he
said
.
``
My
God
,
he
's
grown
another
twenty
inches
.
Fine
to
see
you
.
''
``
How
are
you
,
Mr.
Antolini
?
How
's
Mrs
.
Antolini
?
''
``
We
're
both
just
dandy
.
Let
's
have
that
coat
.
''
He
took
my
coat
off
me
and
hung
it
up
.
``
I
expected
to
see
a
day-old
infant
in
your
arms
.
Nowhere
to
turn
.
Snowflakes
in
your
eyelashes
.
''
He
's
a
very
witty
guy
sometimes
.
He
turned
around
and
yelled
out
to
the
kitchen
,
``
Lillian
!
How
's
the
coffee
coming
?
''
Lillian
was
Mrs.
Antolini
's
first
name
.
``
It
's
all
ready
,
''
she
yelled
back
.
``
Is
that
Holden
?
Hello
,
Holden
!
''
``
Hello
,
Mrs
.
Antolini
!
''
You
were
always
yelling
when
you
were
there
.
That
's
because
the
both
of
them
were
never
in
the
same
room
at
the
same
time
.
It
was
sort
of
funny
.
``
Sit
down
,
Holden
,
''
Mr.
Antolini
said
.
You
could
tell
he
was
a
little
oiled
up
.
The
room
looked
like
they
'd
just
had
a
party
.
Glasses
were
all
over
the
place
,
and
dishes
with
peanuts
in
them
.
``
Excuse
the
appearance
of
the
place
,
''
he
said
.
``
We
've
been
entertaining
some
Buffalo
friends
of
Mrs.
Antolini
's
.
.
.
Some
buffaloes
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
.
''
I
laughed
,
and
Mrs.
Antolini
yelled
something
in
to
me
from
the
kitchen
,
but
I
could
n't
hear
her
.
``
What
'd
she
say
?
''
I
asked
Mr.
Antolini
.
``
She
said
not
to
look
at
her
when
she
comes
in
.
She
just
arose
from
the
sack
.
Have
a
cigarette
.
Are
you
smoking
now
?
''
``
Thanks
,
''
I
said
.
I
took
a
cigarette
from
the
box
he
offered
me
.
``
Just
once
in
a
while
.
I
'm
a
moderate
smoker
.
''
``
I
'll
bet
you
are
,
''
he
said
.
He
gave
me
a
light
from
this
big
lighter
off
the
table
.
``
So
.
You
and
Pencey
are
no
longer
one
,
''
he
said
.
He
always
said
things
that
way
.
Sometimes
it
amused
me
a
lot
and
sometimes
it
did
n't
.
He
sort
of
did
it
a
little
bit
too
much
.
I
do
n't
mean
he
was
n't
witty
or
anything
--
he
was
--
but
sometimes
it
gets
on
your
nerves
when
somebody
's
always
saying
things
like
``
So
you
and
Pencey
are
no
longer
one
.
''
D.B
.
does
it
too
much
sometimes
,
too
.
``
What
was
the
trouble
?
''
Mr.
Antolini
asked
me
.
``
How
'd
you
do
in
English
?
I
'll
show
you
the
door
in
short
order
if
you
flunked
English
,
you
little
ace
composition
writer
.
''
``
Oh
,
I
passed
English
all
right
.
It
was
mostly
literature
,
though
.
I
only
wrote
about
two
compositions
the
whole
term
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
flunked
Oral
Expression
,
though
.
They
had
this
course
you
had
to
take
,
Oral
Expression
.
That
I
flunked
.
''
``
Why
?
''
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
''
I
did
n't
feel
much
like
going
into
It
.
I
was
still
feeling
sort
of
dizzy
or
something
,
and
I
had
a
helluva
headache
all
of
a
sudden
.
I
really
did
.
But
you
could
tell
he
was
interested
,
so
I
told
him
a
little
bit
about
it
.
``
It
's
this
course
where
each
boy
in
class
has
to
get
up
in
class
and
make
a
speech
.
You
know
.
Spontaneous
and
all
.
And
if
the
boy
digresses
at
all
,
you
're
supposed
to
yell
'Digression
!
'
at
him
as
fast
as
you
can
.
It
just
about
drove
me
crazy
.
I
got
an
F
in
it
.
''
``
Why
?
''
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
That
digression
business
got
on
my
nerves
.
I
do
n't
know
.
The
trouble
with
me
is
,
I
like
it
when
somebody
digresses
.
It
's
more
interesting
and
all
.
''
``
You
do
n't
care
to
have
somebody
stick
to
the
point
when
he
tells
you
something
?
''
``
Oh
,
sure
!
I
like
somebody
to
stick
to
the
point
and
all
.
But
I
do
n't
like
them
to
stick
too
much
to
the
point
.
I
do
n't
know
.
I
guess
I
do
n't
like
it
when
somebody
sticks
to
the
point
all
the
time
.
The
boys
that
got
the
best
marks
in
Oral
Expression
were
the
ones
that
stuck
to
the
point
all
the
time
--
I
admit
it
.
But
there
was
this
one
boy
,
Richard
Kinsella
.
He
did
n't
stick
to
the
point
too
much
,
and
they
were
always
yelling
'Digression
!
'
at
him
.
It
was
terrible
,
because
in
the
first
place
,
he
was
a
very
nervous
guy
--
I
mean
he
was
a
very
nervous
guy
--
and
his
lips
were
always
shaking
whenever
it
was
his
time
to
make
a
speech
,
and
you
could
hardly
hear
him
if
you
were
sitting
way
in
the
back
of
the
room
.
When
his
lips
sort
of
quit
shaking
a
little
bit
,
though
,
I
liked
his
speeches
better
than
anybody
else
's
.
He
practically
flunked
the
course
,
though
,
too
.
He
got
a
D
plus
because
they
kept
yelling
'Digression
!
'
at
him
all
the
time
.
For
instance
,
he
made
this
speech
about
this
farm
his
father
bought
in
Vermont
.
They
kept
yelling
'Digression
!
'
at
him
the
whole
time
he
was
making
it
,
and
this
teacher
,
Mr.
Vinson
,
gave
him
an
F
on
it
because
he
had
n't
told
what
kind
of
animals
and
vegetables
and
stuff
grew
on
the
farm
and
all
.
What
he
did
was
,
Richard
Kinsella
,
he
'd
start
telling
you
all
about
that
stuff
--
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
'd
start
telling
you
about
this
letter
his
mother
got
from
his
uncle
,
and
how
his
uncle
got
polio
and
all
when
he
was
forty-two
years
old
,
and
how
he
would
n't
let
anybody
come
to
see
him
in
the
hospital
because
he
did
n't
want
anybody
to
see
him
with
a
brace
on
.
It
did
n't
have
much
to
do
with
the
farm
--
I
admit
it
--
but
it
was
nice
.
It
's
nice
when
somebody
tells
you
about
their
uncle
.
Especially
when
they
start
out
telling
you
about
their
father
's
farm
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
get
more
interested
in
their
uncle
.
I
mean
it
's
dirty
to
keep
yelling
'Digression
!
'
at
him
when
he
's
all
nice
and
excited
.
I
do
n't
know
.
It
's
hard
to
explain
.
''
I
did
n't
feel
too
much
like
trying
,
either
.
For
one
thing
,
I
had
this
terrific
headache
all
of
a
sudden
.
I
wished
to
God
old
Mrs.
Antolini
would
come
in
with
the
coffee
.
That
's
something
that
annoys
hell
out
of
me
--
I
mean
if
somebody
says
the
coffee
's
all
ready
and
it
is
n't
.
``
Holden
.
.
.
One
short
,
faintly
stuffy
,
pedagogical
question
.
Do
n't
you
think
there
's
a
time
and
place
for
everything
?
Do
n't
you
think
if
someone
starts
out
to
tell
you
about
his
father
's
farm
,
he
should
stick
to
his
guns
,
then
get
around
to
telling
you
about
his
uncle
's
brace
?
Or
,
if
his
uncle
's
brace
is
such
a
provocative
subject
,
should
n't
he
have
selected
it
in
the
first
place
as
his
subject
--
not
the
farm
?
''
I
did
n't
feel
much
like
thinking
and
answering
and
all
.
I
had
a
headache
and
I
felt
lousy
.
I
even
had
sort
of
a
stomach-ache
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
``
Yes
--
I
do
n't
know
.
I
guess
he
should
.
I
mean
I
guess
he
should
've
picked
his
uncle
as
a
subject
,
instead
of
the
farm
,
if
that
interested
him
most
.
But
what
I
mean
is
,
lots
of
time
you
do
n't
know
what
interests
you
most
till
you
start
talking
about
something
that
does
n't
interest
you
most
.
I
mean
you
ca
n't
help
it
sometimes
.
What
I
think
is
,
you
're
supposed
to
leave
somebody
alone
if
he
's
at
least
being
interesting
and
he
's
getting
all
excited
about
something
.
I
like
it
when
somebody
gets
excited
about
something
.
It
's
nice
.
You
just
did
n't
know
this
teacher
,
Mr.
Vinson
.
He
could
drive
you
crazy
sometimes
,
him
and
the
goddam
class
.
I
mean
he
'd
keep
telling
you
to
unify
and
simplify
all
the
time
.
Some
things
you
just
ca
n't
do
that
to
.
I
mean
you
ca
n't
hardly
ever
simplify
and
unify
something
just
because
somebody
wants
you
to
.
You
did
n't
know
this
guy
,
Mr.
Vinson
.
I
mean
he
was
very
intelligent
and
all
,
but
you
could
tell
he
did
n't
have
too
much
brains
.

``
Coffee
,
gentlemen
,
finally
,
''
Mrs.
Antolini
said
.
She
came
in
carrying
this
tray
with
coffee
and
cakes
and
stuff
on
it
.
``
Holden
,
do
n't
you
even
peek
at
me
.
I
'm
a
mess
.
''
``
Hello
,
Mrs.
Antolini
,
''
I
said
.
I
started
to
get
up
and
all
,
but
Mr.
Antolini
got
hold
of
my
jacket
and
pulled
me
back
down
.
Old
Mrs.
Antolini
's
hair
was
full
of
those
iron
curler
jobs
,
and
she
did
n't
have
any
lipstick
or
anything
on
.
She
did
n't
look
too
gorgeous
.
She
looked
pretty
old
and
all
.
``
I
'll
leave
this
right
here
.
Just
dive
in
,
you
two
,
''
she
said
.
She
put
the
tray
down
on
the
cigarette
table
,
pushing
all
these
glasses
out
of
the
way
.
``
How
's
your
mother
,
Holden
?
''
``
She
's
fine
,
thanks
.
I
have
n't
seen
her
too
recently
,
but
the
last
I
--
''
``
Darling
,
if
Holden
needs
anything
,
everything
's
in
the
linen
closet
.
The
top
shelf
.
I
'm
going
to
bed
.
I
'm
exhausted
,
''
Mrs.
Antolini
said
.
She
looked
it
,
too
.
``
Can
you
boys
make
up
the
couch
by
yourselves
?
''
``
We
'll
take
care
of
everything
.
You
run
along
to
bed
,
''
Mr.
Antolini
said
.
He
gave
Mrs.
Antolini
a
kiss
and
she
said
good-by
to
me
and
went
in
the
bedroom
.
They
were
always
kissing
each
other
a
lot
in
public
.
I
had
part
of
a
cup
of
coffee
and
about
half
of
some
cake
that
was
as
hard
as
a
rock
.
All
old
Mr.
Antolini
had
was
another
highball
,
though
.
He
makes
them
strong
,
too
,
you
could
tell
.
He
may
get
to
be
an
alcoholic
if
he
does
n't
watch
his
step
.
``
I
had
lunch
with
your
dad
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
,
''
he
said
all
of
a
sudden
.
``
Did
you
know
that
?
''
``
No
,
I
did
n't
.
''
``
You
're
aware
,
of
course
,
that
he
's
terribly
concerned
about
you
.
''
``
I
know
it
.
I
know
he
is
,
''
I
said
.
``
Apparently
before
he
phoned
me
he
'd
just
had
a
long
,
rather
harrowing
letter
from
your
latest
headmaster
,
to
the
effect
that
you
were
making
absolutely
no
effort
at
all
.
Cutting
classes
.
Coming
unprepared
to
all
your
classes
.
In
general
,
being
an
all-around
--
''
``
I
did
n't
cut
any
classes
.
You
were
n't
allowed
to
cut
any
.
There
were
a
couple
of
them
I
did
n't
attend
once
in
a
while
,
like
that
Oral
Expression
I
told
you
about
,
but
I
did
n't
cut
any
.
''
I
did
n't
feel
at
all
like
discussing
it
.
The
coffee
made
my
stomach
feel
a
little
better
,
but
I
still
had
this
awful
headache
.
Mr.
Antolini
lit
another
cigarette
.
He
smoked
like
a
fiend
.
Then
he
said
,
``
Frankly
,
I
do
n't
know
what
the
hell
to
say
to
you
,
Holden
.
''
``
I
know
.
I
'm
very
hard
to
talk
to
.
I
realize
that
.
''
``
I
have
a
feeling
that
you
're
riding
for
some
kind
of
a
terrible
,
terrible
fall
.
But
I
do
n't
honestly
know
what
kind
.
.
.
Are
you
listening
to
me
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
You
could
tell
he
was
trying
to
concentrate
and
all
.
``
It
may
be
the
kind
where
,
at
the
age
of
thirty
,
you
sit
in
some
bar
hating
everybody
who
comes
in
looking
as
if
he
might
have
played
football
in
college
.
Then
again
,
you
may
pick
up
just
enough
education
to
hate
people
who
say
,
'It
's
a
secret
between
he
and
I
.
'
Or
you
may
end
up
in
some
business
office
,
throwing
paper
clips
at
the
nearest
stenographer
.
I
just
do
n't
know
.
But
do
you
know
what
I
'm
driving
at
,
at
all
?
''
``
Yes
.
Sure
,
''
I
said
.
I
did
,
too
.
``
But
you
're
wrong
about
that
hating
business
.
I
mean
about
hating
football
players
and
all
.
You
really
are
.
I
do
n't
hate
too
many
guys
.
What
I
may
do
,
I
may
hate
them
for
a
little
while
,
like
this
guy
Stradlater
I
knew
at
Pencey
,
and
this
other
boy
,
Robert
Ackley
.
I
hated
them
once
in
a
while
--
I
admit
it
--
but
it
does
n't
last
too
long
,
is
what
I
mean
.
After
a
while
,
if
I
did
n't
see
them
,
if
they
did
n't
come
in
the
room
,
or
if
I
did
n't
see
them
in
the
dining
room
for
a
couple
of
meals
,
I
sort
of
missed
them
.
I
mean
I
sort
of
missed
them
.
''
Mr.
Antolini
did
n't
say
anything
for
a
while
.
He
got
up
and
got
another
hunk
of
ice
and
put
it
in
his
drink
,
then
he
sat
down
again
.
You
could
tell
he
was
thinking
.
I
kept
wishing
,
though
,
that
he
'd
continue
the
conversation
in
the
morning
,
instead
of
now
,
but
he
was
hot
.
People
are
mostly
hot
to
have
a
discussion
when
you
're
not
.
``
All
right
.
Listen
to
me
a
minute
now
.
.
.
I
may
not
word
this
as
memorably
as
I
'd
like
to
,
but
I
'll
write
you
a
letter
about
it
in
a
day
or
two
.
Then
you
can
get
it
all
straight
.
But
listen
now
,
anyway
.
''
He
started
concentrating
again
.
Then
he
said
,
``
This
fall
I
think
you
're
riding
for
--
it
's
a
special
kind
of
fall
,
a
horrible
kind
.
The
man
falling
is
n't
permitted
to
feel
or
hear
himself
hit
bottom
.
He
just
keeps
falling
and
falling
.
The
whole
arrangement
's
designed
for
men
who
,
at
some
time
or
other
in
their
lives
,
were
looking
for
something
their
own
environment
could
n't
supply
them
with
.
Or
they
thought
their
own
environment
could
n't
supply
them
with
.
So
they
gave
up
looking
.
They
gave
it
up
before
they
ever
really
even
got
started
.
You
follow
me
?
''
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
``
Sure
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
He
got
up
and
poured
some
more
booze
in
his
glass
.
Then
he
sat
down
again
.
He
did
n't
say
anything
for
a
long
time
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
scare
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
I
can
very
clearly
see
you
dying
nobly
,
one
way
or
another
,
for
some
highly
unworthy
cause
.
''
He
gave
me
a
funny
look
.
``
If
I
write
something
down
for
you
,
will
you
read
it
carefully
?
And
keep
it
?
''
``
Yes
.
Sure
,
''
I
said
.
I
did
,
too
.
I
still
have
the
paper
he
gave
me
.
He
went
over
to
this
desk
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
and
without
sitting
down
wrote
something
on
a
piece
of
paper
.
Then
he
came
back
and
sat
down
with
the
paper
in
his
hand
.
``
Oddly
enough
,
this
was
n't
written
by
a
practicing
poet
.
It
was
written
by
a
psychoanalyst
named
Wilhelm
Stekel
.
Here
's
what
he
--
Are
you
still
with
me
?
''
``
Yes
,
sure
I
am
.
''
``
Here
's
what
he
said
:
'The
mark
of
the
immature
man
is
that
he
wants
to
die
nobly
for
a
cause
,
while
the
mark
of
the
mature
man
is
that
he
wants
to
live
humbly
for
one
.
'
''
He
leaned
over
and
handed
it
to
me
.
I
read
it
right
when
he
gave
it
to
me
,
and
then
I
thanked
him
and
all
and
put
it
in
my
pocket
.
It
was
nice
of
him
to
go
to
all
that
trouble
.
It
really
was
.
The
thing
was
,
though
,
I
did
n't
feel
much
like
concentrating
.
Boy
,
I
felt
so
damn
tired
all
of
a
sudden
.
You
could
tell
he
was
n't
tired
at
all
,
though
.
He
was
pretty
oiled
up
,
for
one
thing
.
``
I
think
that
one
of
these
days
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
're
going
to
have
to
find
out
where
you
want
to
go
.
And
then
you
've
got
to
start
going
there
.
But
immediately
.
You
ca
n't
afford
to
lose
a
minute
.
Not
you
.
''
I
nodded
,
because
he
was
looking
right
at
me
and
all
,
but
I
was
n't
too
sure
what
he
was
talking
about
.
I
was
pretty
sure
I
knew
,
but
I
was
n't
too
positive
at
the
time
.
I
was
too
damn
tired
.
``
And
I
hate
to
tell
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
I
think
that
once
you
have
a
fair
idea
where
you
want
to
go
,
your
first
move
will
be
to
apply
yourself
in
school
.
You
'll
have
to
.
You
're
a
student
--
whether
the
idea
appeals
to
you
or
not
.
You
're
in
love
with
knowledge
.
And
I
think
you
'll
find
,
once
you
get
past
all
the
Mr.
Vineses
and
their
Oral
Comp
--
''
``
Mr.
Vinsons
,
''
I
said
.
He
meant
all
the
Mr.
Vinsons
,
not
all
the
Mr.
Vineses
.
I
should
n't
have
interrupted
him
,
though
.
``
All
right
--
the
Mr.
Vinsons
.
Once
you
get
past
all
the
Mr.
Vinsons
,
you
're
going
to
start
getting
closer
and
closer
--
that
is
,
if
you
want
to
,
and
if
you
look
for
it
and
wait
for
it
--
to
the
kind
of
information
that
will
be
very
,
very
dear
to
your
heart
.
Among
other
things
,
you
'll
find
that
you
're
not
the
first
person
who
was
ever
confused
and
frightened
and
even
sickened
by
human
behavior
.
You
're
by
no
means
alone
on
that
score
,
you
'll
be
excited
and
stimulated
to
know
.
Many
,
many
men
have
been
just
as
troubled
morally
and
spiritually
as
you
are
right
now
.
Happily
,
some
of
them
kept
records
of
their
troubles
.
You
'll
learn
from
them
--
if
you
want
to
.
Just
as
someday
,
if
you
have
something
to
offer
,
someone
will
learn
something
from
you
.
It
's
a
beautiful
reciprocal
arrangement
.
And
it
is
n't
education
.
It
's
history
.
It
's
poetry
.
''
He
stopped
and
took
a
big
drink
out
of
his
highball
.
Then
he
started
again
.
Boy
,
he
was
really
hot
.
I
was
glad
I
did
n't
try
to
stop
him
or
anything
.
``
I
'm
not
trying
to
tell
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
only
educated
and
scholarly
men
are
able
to
contribute
something
valuable
to
the
world
.
It
's
not
so
.
But
I
do
say
that
educated
and
scholarly
men
,
if
they
're
brilliant
and
creative
to
begin
with
--
which
,
unfortunately
,
is
rarely
the
case
--
tend
to
leave
infinitely
more
valuable
records
behind
them
than
men
do
who
are
merely
brilliant
and
creative
.
They
tend
to
express
themselves
more
clearly
,
and
they
usually
have
a
passion
for
following
their
thoughts
through
to
the
end
.
And
--
most
important
--
nine
times
out
of
ten
they
have
more
humility
than
the
unscholarly
thinker
.
Do
you
follow
me
at
all
?
''
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
He
did
n't
say
anything
again
for
quite
a
while
.
I
do
n't
know
if
you
've
ever
done
it
,
but
it
's
sort
of
hard
to
sit
around
waiting
for
somebody
to
say
something
when
they
're
thinking
and
all
.
It
really
is
.
I
kept
trying
not
to
yawn
.
It
was
n't
that
I
was
bored
or
anything
--
I
was
n't
--
but
I
was
so
damn
sleepy
all
of
a
sudden
.
``
Something
else
an
academic
education
will
do
for
you
.
If
you
go
along
with
it
any
considerable
distance
,
it
'll
begin
to
give
you
an
idea
what
size
mind
you
have
.
What
it
'll
fit
and
,
maybe
,
what
it
wo
n't

After
a
while
,
you
'll
have
an
idea
what
kind
of
thoughts
your
particular
size
mind
should
be
wearing
.
For
one
thing
,
it
may
save
you
an
extraordinary
amount
of
time
trying
on
ideas
that
do
n't
suit
you
,
are
n't
becoming
to
you
.
You
'll
begin
to
know
your
true
measurements
and
dress
your
mind
accordingly

''
Then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
I
yawned
.
What
a
rude
bastard
,
but
I
could
n't
help
it
!
Mr.
Antolini
just
laughed
,
though
.
``
C'mon
,
''
he
said
,
and
got
up
.
``
We
'll
fix
up
the
couch
for
you
.
''
I
followed
him
and
he
went
over
to
this
closet
and
tried
to
take
down
some
sheets
and
blankets
and
stuff
that
was
on
the
top
shelf
,
but
he
could
n't
do
it
with
this
highball
glass
in
his
hand
.
So
he
drank
it
and
then
put
the
glass
down
on
the
floor
and
then
he
took
the
stuff
down
.
I
helped
him
bring
it
over
to
the
couch
.
We
both
made
the
bed
together
.
He
was
n't
too
hot
at
it
.
He
did
n't
tuck
anything
in
very
tight
.
I
did
n't
care
,
though
.
I
could
've
slept
standing
up
I
was
so
tired
.
``
How
're
all
your
women
?
''
``
They
're
okay
.
''
I
was
being
a
lousy
conversationalist
,
but
I
did
n't
feel
like
it
.
``
How
's
Sally
?
''
He
knew
old
Sally
Hayes
.
I
introduced
him
once
.
``
She
's
all
right
.
I
had
a
date
with
her
this
afternoon

Boy
,
it
seemed
like
twenty
years
ago
!
``
We
do
n't
have
too
much
in
common
any
more
.
''
``
Helluva
pretty
girl
.
What
about
that
other
girl
?
The
one
you
told
me
about
,
in
Maine
?
''
``
Oh
--
Jane
Gallagher
.
She
's
all
right
.
I
'm
probably
gon
na
give
her
a
buzz
tomorrow
.
''
We
were
all
done
making
up
the
couch
then
.
``
It
's
all
yours
,
''
Mr.
Antolini
said
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
the
hell
you
're
going
to
do
with
those
legs
of
yours
.
''
``
That
's
all
right
.
I
'm
used
to
short
beds
,
''
I
said
.
``
Thanks
a
lot
,
sir
.
You
and
Mrs.
Antolini
really
saved
my
life
tonight
.
''
``
You
know
where
the
bathroom
is
.
If
there
's
anything
you
want
,
just
holler
.
I
'll
be
in
the
kitchen
for
a
while
--
will
the
light
bother
you
?
''
``
No
--
heck
,
no
.
Thanks
a
lot
.
''
``
All
right
.
Good
night
,
handsome
.
''
``
G'night
,
sir
.
Thanks
a
lot
.
''
He
went
out
in
the
kitchen
and
I
went
in
the
bathroom
and
got
undressed
and
all
.
I
could
n't
brush
my
teeth
because
I
did
n't
have
any
toothbrush
with
me
.
I
did
n't
have
any
pajamas
either
and
Mr.
Antolini
forgot
to
lend
me
some
.
So
I
just
went
back
in
the
living
room
and
turned
off
this
little
lamp
next
to
the
couch
,
and
then
I
got
in
bed
with
just
my
shorts
on
.
It
was
way
too
short
for
me
,
the
couch
,
but
I
really
could
've
slept
standing
up
without
batting
an
eyelash
.
I
laid
awake
for
just
a
couple
of
seconds
thinking
about
all
that
stuff
Mr.
Antolini
'd
told
me
.
About
finding
out
the
size
of
your
mind
and
all
.
He
was
really
a
pretty
smart
guy
.
But
I
could
n't
keep
my
goddam
eyes
open
,
and
I
fell
asleep
.
Then
something
happened
.
I
do
n't
even
like
to
talk
about
it
.
I
woke
up
all
of
a
sudden
.
I
do
n't
know
what
time
it
was
or
anything
,
but
I
woke
up
.
I
felt
something
on
my
head
,
some
guy
's
hand
.
Boy
,
it
really
scared
hell
out
of
me
.
What
it
was
,
it
was
Mr.
Antolini
's
hand
.
What
he
was
doing
was
,
he
was
sitting
on
the
floor
right
next
to
the
couch
,
in
the
dark
and
all
,
and
he
was
sort
of
petting
me
or
patting
me
on
the
goddam
head
.
Boy
,
I
'll
bet
I
jumped
about
a
thousand
feet
.
``
What
the
hellya
doing
?
''
I
said
.
``
Nothing
!
I
'm
simply
sitting
here
,
admiring
--
''
``
What
're
ya
doing
,
anyway
?
''
I
said
over
again
.
I
did
n't
know
what
the
hell
to
say-
-I
mean
I
was
embarrassed
as
hell
.
``
How
'bout
keeping
your
voice
down
?
I
'm
simply
sitting
here
--
''
``
I
have
to
go
,
anyway
,
''
I
said
--
boy
,
was
I
nervous
!
I
started
putting
on
my
damn
pants
in
the
dark
.
I
could
hardly
get
them
on
I
was
so
damn
nervous
.
I
know
more
damn
perverts
,
at
schools
and
all
,
than
anybody
you
ever
met
,
and
they
're
always
being
perverty
when
I
'm
around
.
``
You
have
to
go
where
?
''
Mr.
Antolini
said
.
He
was
trying
to
act
very
goddam
casual
and
cool
and
all
,
but
he
was
n't
any
too
goddam
cool
.
Take
my
word
.
``
I
left
my
bags
and
all
at
the
station
.
I
think
maybe
I
'd
better
go
down
and
get
them
.
I
have
all
my
stuff
in
them
.
''
``
They
'll
be
there
in
the
morning
.
Now
,
go
back
to
bed
.
I
'm
going
to
bed
myself
.
What
's
the
matter
with
you
?
''
``
Nothing
's
the
matter
,
it
's
just
that
all
my
money
and
stuff
's
in
one
of
my
bags
.
I
'll
be
right
back
.
I
'll
get
a
cab
and
be
right
back
,
''
I
said
.
Boy
,
I
was
falling
all
over
myself
in
the
dark
.
``
The
thing
is
,
it
is
n't
mine
,
the
money
.
It
's
my
mother
's
,
and
I
--
''
``
Do
n't
be
ridiculous
,
Holden
.
Get
back
in
that
bed
.
I
'm
going
to
bed
myself
.
The
money
will
be
there
safe
and
sound
in
the
morn
--
''
``
No
,
no
kidding
.
I
got
ta
get
going
.
I
really
do
.
''
I
was
damn
near
all
dressed
already
,
except
that
I
could
n't
find
my
tie
.
I
could
n't
remember
where
I
'd
put
my
tie
.
I
put
on
my
jacket
and
all
without
it
.
Old
Mr.
Antolini
was
sitting
now
in
the
big
chair
a
little
ways
away
from
me
,
watching
me
.
It
was
dark
and
all
and
I
could
n't
see
him
so
hot
,
but
I
knew
he
was
watching
me
,
all
right
.
He
was
still
boozing
,
too
.
I
could
see
his
trusty
highball
glass
in
his
hand
.
``
You
're
a
very
,
very
strange
boy
.
''
``
I
know
it
,
''
I
said
.
I
did
n't
even
look
around
much
for
my
tie
.
So
I
went
without
it
.
``
Good-by
,
sir
,
''
I
said
,
``
Thanks
a
lot
.
No
kidding
.
''
He
kept
walking
right
behind
me
when
I
went
to
the
front
door
,
and
when
I
rang
the
elevator
bell
he
stayed
in
the
damn
doorway
.
All
he
said
was
that
business
about
my
being
a
``
very
,
very
strange
boy
''
again
.
Strange
,
my
ass
.
Then
he
waited
in
the
doorway
and
all
till
the
goddam
elevator
came
.
I
never
waited
so
long
for
an
elevator
in
my
whole
goddam
life
.
I
swear
.
I
did
n't
know
what
the
hell
to
talk
about
while
I
was
waiting
for
the
elevator
,
and
he
kept
standing
there
,
so
I
said
,
``
I
'm
gon
na
start
reading
some
good
books
.
I
really
am
.
''
I
mean
you
had
to
say
something
.
It
was
very
embarrassing
.
``
You
grab
your
bags
and
scoot
right
on
back
here
again
.
I
'll
leave
the
door
unlatched
.
''
``
Thanks
a
lot
,
''
I
said
.
``
G'by
!
''
The
elevator
was
finally
there
.
I
got
in
and
went
down
.
Boy
,
I
was
shaking
like
a
madman
.
I
was
sweating
,
too
.
When
something
perverty
like
that
happens
,
I
start
sweating
like
a
bastard
.
That
kind
of
stuff
's
happened
to
me
about
twenty
times
since
I
was
a
kid
.
I
ca
n't
stand
it
.
25
When
I
got
outside
,
it
was
just
getting
light
out
.
It
was
pretty
cold
,
too
,
but
it
felt
good
because
I
was
sweating
so
much
.
I
did
n't
know
where
the
hell
to
go
.
I
did
n't
want
to
go
to
another
hotel
and
spend
all
Phoebe
's
dough
.
So
finally
all
I
did
was
I
walked
over
to
Lexington
and
took
the
subway
down
to
Grand
Central
.
My
bags
were
there
and
all
,
and
I
figured
I
'd
sleep
in
that
crazy
waiting
room
where
all
the
benches
are
.
So
that
's
what
I
did
.
It
was
n't
too
bad
for
a
while
because
there
were
n't
many
people
around
and
I
could
stick
my
feet
up
.
But
I
do
n't
feel
much
like
discussing
it
.
It
was
n't
too
nice
.
Do
n't
ever
try
it
.
I
mean
it
.
It
'll
depress
you
.
I
only
slept
till
around
nine
o'clock
because
a
million
people
started
coming
in
the
waiting
room
and
I
had
to
take
my
feet
down
.
I
ca
n't
sleep
so
hot
if
I
have
to
keep
my
feet
on
the
floor
.
So
I
sat
up
.
I
still
had
that
headache
.
It
was
even
worse
.
And
I
think
I
was
more
depressed
than
I
ever
was
in
my
whole
life
.
I
did
n't
want
to
,
but
I
started
thinking
about
old
Mr.
Antolini
and
I
wondered
what
he
'd
tell
Mrs.
Antolini
when
she
saw
I
had
n't
slept
there
or
anything
.
That
part
did
n't
worry
me
too
much
,
though
,
because
I
knew
Mr.
Antolini
was
very
smart
and
that
he
could
make
up
something
to
tell
her
.
He
could
tell
her
I
'd
gone
home
or
something
.
That
part
did
n't
worry
me
much
.
But
what
did
worry
me
was
the
part
about
how
I
'd
woke
up
and
found
him
patting
me
on
the
head
and
all
.
I
mean
I
wondered
if
just
maybe
I
was
wrong
about
thinking
be
was
making
a
flitty
pass
at
ne
.
I
wondered
if
maybe
he
just
liked
to
pat
guys
on
the
head
when
they
're
asleep
.
I
mean
how
can
you
tell
about
that
stuff
for
sure
?
You
ca
n't
.
I
even
started
wondering
if
maybe
I
should
've
got
my
bags
and
gone
back
to
his
house
,
the
way
I
'd
said
I
would
.
I
mean
I
started
thinking
that
even
if
he
was
a
flit
he
certainly
'd
been
very
nice
to
me
.
I
thought
how
he
had
n't
minded
it
when
I
'd
called
him
up
so
late
,
and
how
he
'd
told
me
to
come
right
over
if
I
felt
like
it
.
And
how
he
went
to
all
that
trouble
giving
me
that
advice
about
finding
out
the
size
of
your
mind
and
all
,
and
how
he
was
the
only
guy
that
'd
even
gone
near
that
boy
James
Castle
I
told
you
about
when
he
was
dead
.
I
thought
about
all
that
stuff
.
And
the
more
I
thought
about
it
,
the
more
depressed
I
got
.
I
mean
I
started
thinking
maybe
I
should
've
gone
back
to
his
house
.
Maybe
he
was
only
patting
my
head
just
for
the
hell
of
it
.
The
more
I
thought
about
it
,
though
,
the
more
depressed
and
screwed
up
about
it
I
got
.
What
made
it
even
worse
,
my
eyes
were
sore
as
hell
.
They
felt
sore
and
burny
from
not
getting
too
much
sleep
.
Besides
that
,
I
was
getting
sort
of
a
cold
,
and
I
did
n't
even
have
a
goddam
handkerchief
with
me
.
I
had
some
in
my
suitcase
,
but
I
did
n't
feel
like
taking
it
out
of
that
strong
box
and
opening
it
up
right
in
public
and
all
.
There
was
this
magazine
that
somebody
'd
left
on
the
bench
next
to
me
,
so
I
started
reading
it
,
thinking
it
'd
make
me
stop
thinking
about
Mr.
Antolini
and
a
million
other
things
for
at
least
a
little
while
.
But
this
damn
article
I
started
reading
made
me
feel
almost
worse
.
It
was
all
about
hormones
.
It
described
how
you
should
look
,
your
face
and
eyes
and
all
,
if
your
hormones
were
in
good
shape
,
and
I
did
n't
look
that
way
at
all
.
I
looked
exactly
like
the
guy
in
the
article
with
lousy
hormones
.
So
I
started
getting
worried
about
my
hormones
.
Then
I
read
this
other
article
about
how
you
can
tell
if
you
have
cancer
or
not
.
It
said
if
you
had
any
sores
in
your
mouth
that
did
n't
heal
pretty
quickly
,
it
was
a
sign
that
you
probably
had
cancer
.
I
'd
had
this
sore
on
the
inside
of
my
lip
for
about
two
weeks
.
So
figured
I
was
getting
cancer
.
That
magazine
was
some
little
cheerer
upper
.
I
finally
quit
reading
it
and
went
outside
for
a
walk
.
I
figured
I
'd
be
dead
in
a
couple
of
months
because
I
had
cancer
.
I
really
did
.
I
was
even
positive
I
would
be
.
It
certainly
did
n't
make
me
feel
too
gorgeous
.
It'sort
of
looked
like
it
was
going
to
rain
,
but
I
went
for
this
walk
anyway
.
For
one
thing
,
I
figured
I
ought
to
get
some
breakfast
.
I
was
n't
at
all
hungry
,
but
I
figured
I
ought
to
at
least
eat
something
.
I
mean
at
least
get
something
with
some
vitamins
in
it
.
So
I
started
walking
way
over
east
,
where
the
pretty
cheap
restaurants
are
,
because
I
did
n't
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
dough
.
While
I
was
walking
,
I
passed
these
two
guys
that
were
unloading
this
big
Christmas
tree
off
a
truck
.
One
guy
kept
saying
to
the
other
guy
,
``
Hold
the
sonuvabitch
up
!
Hold
it
up
,
for
Chrissake
!
''
It
certainly
was
a
gorgeous
way
to
talk
about
a
Christmas
tree
.
It
was
sort
of
funny
,
though
,
in
an
awful
way
,
and
I
started
to
sort
of
laugh
.
It
was
about
the
worst
thing
I
could
've
done
,
because
the
minute
I
started
to
laugh
I
thought
I
was
going
to
vomit
.
I
really
did
.
I
even
started
to
,
but
it
went
away
.
I
do
n't
know
why
.
I
mean
I
had
n't
eaten
anything
unsanitary
or
like
that
and
usually
I
have
quite
a
strong
stomach
.
Anyway
,
I
got
over
it
,
and
I
figured
I
'd
feel
better
if
I
had
something
to
eat
.
So
I
went
in
this
very
cheap-looking
restaurant
and
had
doughnuts
and
coffee
.
Only
,
I
did
n't
eat
the
doughnuts
.
I
could
n't
swallow
them
too
well
.
The
thing
is
,
if
you
get
very
depressed
about
something
,
it
's
hard
as
hell
to
swallow
.
The
waiter
was
very
nice
,
though
.
He
took
them
back
without
charging
me
.
I
just
drank
the
coffee
.
Then
I
left
and
started
walking
over
toward
Fifth
Avenue
.
It
was
Monday
and
all
,
and
pretty
near
Christmas
,
and
all
the
stores
were
open
.
So
it
was
n't
too
bad
walking
on
Fifth
Avenue
.
It
was
fairly
Christmasy
.
All
those
scraggy-
looking
Santa
Clauses
were
standing
on
corners
ringing
those
bells
,
and
the
Salvation
Army
girls
,
the
ones
that
do
n't
wear
any
lipstick
or
anything
,
were
tinging
bells
too
.
I
sort
of
kept
looking
around
for
those
two
nuns
I
'd
met
at
breakfast
the
day
before
,
but
I
did
n't
see
them
.
I
knew
I
would
n't
,
because
they
'd
told
me
they
'd
come
to
New
York
to
be
schoolteachers
,
but
I
kept
looking
for
them
anyway
.
Anyway
,
it
was
pretty
Christmasy
all
of
a
sudden
.
A
million
little
kids
were
downtown
with
their
mothers
,
getting
on
and
off
buses
and
coming
in
and
out
of
stores
.
I
wished
old
Phoebe
was
around
.
She
's
not
little
enough
any
more
to
go
stark
staring
mad
in
the
toy
department
,
but
she
enjoys
horsing
around
and
looking
at
the
people
.
The
Christmas
before
last
I
took
her
downtown
shopping
with
me
.
We
had
a
helluva
time
.
I
think
it
was
in
Bloomingdale
's
.
We
went
in
the
shoe
department
and
we
pretended
she
--
old
Phoebe
--
wanted
to
get
a
pair
of
those
very
high
storm
shoes
,
the
kind
that
have
about
a
million
holes
to
lace
up
.
We
had
the
poor
salesman
guy
going
crazy
.
Old
Phoebe
tried
on
about
twenty
pairs
,
and
each
time
the
poor
guy
had
to
lace
one
shoe
all
the
way
up
.
It
was
a
dirty
trick
,
but
it
killed
old
Phoebe
.
We
finally
bought
a
pair
of
moccasins
and
charged
them
.
The
salesman
was
very
nice
about
it
.
I
think
he
knew
we
were
horsing
around
,
because
old
Phoebe
always
starts
giggling
.
Anyway
,
I
kept
walking
and
walking
up
Fifth
Avenue
,
without
any
tie
on
or
anything
.
Then
all
of
a
sudden
,
something
very
spooky
started
happening
.
Every
time
I
came
to
the
end
of
a
block
and
stepped
off
the
goddam
curb
,
I
had
this
feeling
that
I
'd
never
get
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
.
I
thought
I
'd
just
go
down
,
down
,
down
,
and
nobody
'd
ever
see
me
again
.
Boy
,
did
it
scare
me
.
You
ca
n't
imagine
.
I
started
sweating
like
a
bastard
--
my
whole
shirt
and
underwear
and
everything
.
Then
I
started
doing
something
else
.
Every
time
I
'd
get
to
the
end
of
a
block
I
'd
make
believe
I
was
talking
to
my
brother
Allie
.
I
'd
say
to
him
,
``
Allie
,
do
n't
let
me
disappear
.
Allie
,
do
n't
let
me
disappear
.
Allie
,
do
n't
let
me
disappear
.
Please
,
Allie
.
''
And
then
when
I
'd
reach
the
other
side
of
the
street
without
disappearing
,
I
'd
thank
him
.
Then
it
would
start
all
over
again
as
soon
as
I
got
to
the
next
corner
.
But
I
kept
going
and
all
.
I
was
sort
of
afraid
to
stop
,
I
think
--
I
do
n't
remember
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
.
I
know
I
did
n't
stop
till
I
was
way
up
in
the
Sixties
,
past
the
zoo
and
all
.
Then
I
sat
down
on
this
bench
.
I
could
hardly
get
my
breath
,
and
I
was
still
sweating
like
a
bastard
.
I
sat
there
,
I
guess
,
for
about
an
hour
.
Finally
,
what
I
decided
I
'd
do
,
I
decided
I
'd
go
away
.
I
decided
I
'd
never
go
home
again
and
I
'd
never
go
away
to
another
school
again
.
I
decided
I
'd
just
see
old
Phoebe
and
sort
of
say
good-
by
to
her
and
all
,
and
give
her
back
her
Christmas
dough
,
and
then
I
'd
start
hitchhiking
my
way
out
West
.
What
I
'd
do
,
I
figured
,
I
'd
go
down
to
the
Holland
Tunnel
and
bum
a
ride
,
and
then
I
'd
bum
another
one
,
and
another
one
,
and
another
one
,
and
in
a
few
days
I
'd
be
somewhere
out
West
where
it
was
very
pretty
and
sunny
and
where
nobody
'd
know
me
and
I
'd
get
a
job
.
I
figured
I
could
get
a
job
at
a
filling
station
somewhere
,
putting
gas
and
oil
in
people
's
cars
.
I
did
n't
care
what
kind
of
job
it
was
,
though
.
Just
so
people
did
n't
know
me
and
I
did
n't
know
anybody
.
I
thought
what
I
'd
do
was
,
I
'd
pretend
I
was
one
of
those
deaf-mutes
.
That
way
I
would
n't
have
to
have
any
goddam
stupid
useless
conversations
with
anybody
.
If
anybody
wanted
to
tell
me
something
,
they
'd
have
to
write
it
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
shove
it
over
to
me
.
They
'd
get
bored
as
hell
doing
that
after
a
while
,
and
then
I
'd
be
through
with
having
conversations
for
the
rest
of
my
life
.
Everybody
'd
think
I
was
just
a
poor
deaf-mute
bastard
and
they
'd
leave
me
alone
.
They
'd
let
me
put
gas
and
oil
in
their
stupid
cars
,
and
they
'd
pay
me
a
salary
and
all
for
it
,
and
I
'd
build
me
a
little
cabin
somewhere
with
the
dough
I
made
and
live
there
for
the
rest
of
my
life
.
I
'd
build
it
right
near
the
woods
,
but
not
right
in
them
,
because
I
'd
want
it
to
be
sunny
as
hell
all
the
time
.
I
'd
cook
all
my
own
food
,
and
later
on
,
if
I
wanted
to
get
married
or
something
,
I
'd
meet
this
beautiful
girl
that
was
also
a
deaf-mute
and
we
'd
get
married
.
She
'd
come
and
live
in
my
cabin
with
me
,
and
if
she
wanted
to
say
anything
to
me
,
she
'd
have
to
write
it
on
a
goddam
piece
of
paper
,
like
everybody
else
.
If
we
had
any
children
,
we
'd
hide
them
somewhere
.
We
could
buy
them
a
lot
of
books
and
teach
them
how
to
read
and
write
by
ourselves
.
I
got
excited
as
hell
thinking
about
it
.
I
really
did
.
I
knew
the
part
about
pretending
I
was
a
deaf-mute
was
crazy
,
but
I
liked
thinking
about
it
anyway
.
But
I
really
decided
to
go
out
West
and
all
.
All
I
wanted
to
do
first
was
say
good-by
to
old
Phoebe
.
So
all
of
a
sudden
,
I
ran
like
a
madman
across
the
street
--
I
damn
near
got
killed
doing
it
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
--
and
went
in
this
stationery
store
and
bought
a
pad
and
pencil
.
I
figured
I
'd
write
her
a
note
telling
her
where
to
meet
me
so
I
could
say
good-by
to
her
and
give
her
back
her
Christmas
dough
,
and
then
I
'd
take
the
note
up
to
her
school
and
get
somebody
in
the
principal
's
office
to
give
it
to
her
.
But
I
just
put
the
pad
and
pencil
in
my
pocket
and
started
walking
fast
as
hell
up
to
her
school
--
I
was
too
excited
to
write
the
note
right
in
the
stationery
store
.
I
walked
fast
because
I
wanted
her
to
get
the
note
before
she
went
home
for
lunch
,
and
I
did
n't
have
any
too
much
time
.
I
knew
where
her
school
was
,
naturally
,
because
I
went
there
myself
when
I
was
a
kid
.
When
I
got
there
,
it
felt
funny
.
I
was
n't
sure
I
'd
remember
what
it
was
like
inside
,
but
I
did
.
It
was
exactly
the
same
as
it
was
when
I
went
there
.
They
had
that
same
big
yard
inside
,
that
was
always
sort
of
dark
,
with
those
cages
around
the
light
bulbs
so
they
would
n't
break
if
they
got
hit
with
a
ball
.
They
had
those
same
white
circles
painted
all
over
the
floor
,
for
games
and
stuff
.
And
those
same
old
basketball
rings
without
any
nets-
-just
the
backboards
and
the
rings
.
Nobody
was
around
at
all
,
probably
because
it
was
n't
recess
period
,
and
it
was
n't
lunchtime
yet
.
All
I
saw
was
one
little
kid
,
a
colored
kid
,
on
his
way
to
the
bathroom
.
He
had
one
of
those
wooden
passes
sticking
out
of
his
hip
pocket
,
the
same
way
we
used
to
have
,
to
show
he
had
permission
and
all
to
go
to
the
bathroom
.
I
was
still
sweating
,
but
not
so
bad
any
more
.
I
went
over
to
the
stairs
and
sat
down
on
the
first
step
and
took
out
the
pad
and
pencil
I
'd
bought
.
The
stairs
had
the
same
smell
they
used
to
have
when
I
went
there
.
Like
somebody
'd
just
taken
a
leak
on
them
.
School
stairs
always
smell
like
that
.
Anyway
,
I
sat
there
and
wrote
this
note
:
DEAR
PHOEBE
,
I
ca
n't
wait
around
till
Wednesday
any
more
so
I
will
probably
hitch
hike
out
west
this
afternoon
.
Meet
me
at
the
Museum
of
art
near
the
door
at
quarter
past
12
if
you
can
and
I
will
give
you
your
Christmas
dough
back
.
I
did
n't
spend
much
.
Love
,
HOLDEN
Her
school
was
practically
right
near
the
museum
,
and
she
had
to
pass
it
on
her
way
home
for
lunch
anyway
,
so
I
knew
she
could
meet
me
all
right
.
Then
I
started
walking
up
the
stairs
to
the
principal
's
office
so
I
could
give
the
note
to
somebody
that
would
bring
it
to
her
in
her
classroom
.
I
folded
it
about
ten
times
so
nobody
'd
open
it
.
You
ca
n't
trust
anybody
in
a
goddam
school
.
But
I
knew
they
'd
give
it
to
her
if
I
was
her
brother
and
all
.
While
I
was
walking
up
the
stairs
,
though
,
all
of
a
sudden
I
thought
I
was
going
to
puke
again
.
Only
,
I
did
n't
.
I
sat
down
for
a
second
,
and
then
I
felt
better
.
But
while
I
was
sitting
down
,
I
saw
something
that
drove
me
crazy
.
Somebody
'd
written
``
Fuck
you
''
on
the
wall
.
It
drove
me
damn
near
crazy
.
I
thought
how
Phoebe
and
all
the
other
little
kids
would
see
it
,
and
how
they
'd
wonder
what
the
hell
it
meant
,
and
then
finally
some
dirty
kid
would
tell
them
--
all
cockeyed
,
naturally
--
what
it
meant
,
and
how
they
'd
all
think
about
it
and
maybe
even
worry
about
it
for
a
couple
of
days
.
I
kept
wanting
to
kill
whoever
'd
written
it
.
I
figured
it
was
some
perverty
bum
that
'd
sneaked
in
the
school
late
at
night
to
take
a
leak
or
something
and
then
wrote
it
on
the
wall
.
I
kept
picturing
myself
catching
him
at
it
,
and
how
I
'd
smash
his
head
on
the
stone
steps
till
he
was
good
and
goddam
dead
and
bloody
.
But
I
knew
,
too
,
I
would
n't
have
the
guts
to
do
it
.
I
knew
that
.
That
made
me
even
more
depressed
.
I
hardly
even
had
the
guts
to
rub
it
off
the
wall
with
my
hand
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
I
was
afraid
some
teacher
would
catch
me
rubbing
it
off
and
would
think
I
'd
written
it
.
But
I
rubbed
it
out
anyway
,
finally
.
Then
I
went
on
up
to
the
principal
's
office
.
The
principal
did
n't
seem
to
be
around
,
but
some
old
lady
around
a
hundred
years
old
was
sitting
at
a
typewriter
.
I
told
her
I
was
Phoebe
Caulfield
's
brother
,
in
4B-1
,
and
I
asked
her
to
please
give
Phoebe
the
note
.
I
said
it
was
very
important
because
my
mother
was
sick
and
would
n't
have
lunch
ready
for
Phoebe
and
that
she
'd
have
to
meet
me
and
have
lunch
in
a
drugstore
.
She
was
very
nice
about
it
,
the
old
lady
.
She
took
the
note
off
me
and
called
some
other
lady
,
from
the
next
office
,
and
the
other
lady
went
to
give
it
to
Phoebe
.
Then
the
old
lady
that
was
around
a
hundred
years
old
and
I
shot
the
breeze
for
a
while
,
She
was
pretty
nice
,
and
I
told
her
how
I
'd
gone
there
to
school
,
too
,
and
my
brothers
.
She
asked
me
where
I
went
to
school
now
,
and
I
told
her
Pencey
,
and
she
said
Pencey
was
a
very
good
school
.
Even
if
I
'd
wanted
to
,
I
would
n't
have
had
the
strength
to
straighten
her
out
.
Besides
,
if
she
thought
Pencey
was
a
very
good
school
,
let
her
think
it
.
You
hate
to
tell
new
stuff
to
somebody
around
a
hundred
years
old
.
They
do
n't
like
to
hear
it
.
Then
,
after
a
while
,
I
left
.
It
was
funny
.
She
yelled
``
Good
luck
!
''
at
me
the
same
way
old
Spencer
did
when
I
left
Pencey
.
God
,
how
I
hate
it
when
somebody
yells
``
Good
luck
!
''
at
me
when
I
'm
leaving
somewhere
.
It
's
depressing
.
I
went
down
by
a
different
staircase
,
and
I
saw
another
``
Fuck
you
''
on
the
wall
.
I
tried
to
rub
it
off
with
my
hand
again
,
but
this
one
was
scratched
on
,
with
a
knife
or
something
.
It
would
n't
come
off
.
It
's
hopeless
,
anyway
.
If
you
had
a
million
years
to
do
it
in
,
you
could
n't
rub
out
even
half
the
``
Fuck
you
''
signs
in
the
world
.
It
's
impossible
.
I
looked
at
the
clock
in
the
recess
yard
,
and
it
was
only
twenty
to
twelve
,
so
I
had
quite
a
lot
of
time
to
kill
before
I
met
old
Phoebe
.
But
I
just
walked
over
to
the
museum
anyway
.
There
was
n't
anyplace
else
to
go
.
I
thought
maybe
I
might
stop
in
a
phone
booth
and
give
old
Jane
Gallagher
a
buzz
before
I
started
bumming
my
way
west
,
but
I
was
n't
in
the
mood
.
For
one
thing
,
I
was
n't
even
sure
she
was
home
for
vacation
yet
.
So
I
just
went
over
to
the
museum
,
and
hung
around
.
While
I
was
waiting
around
for
Phoebe
in
the
museum
,
right
inside
the
doors
and
all
,
these
two
little
kids
came
up
to
me
and
asked
me
if
I
knew
where
the
mummies
were
.
The
one
little
kid
,
the
one
that
asked
me
,
had
his
pants
open
.
I
told
him
about
it
.
So
he
buttoned
them
up
right
where
he
was
standing
talking
to
me
--
he
did
n't
even
bother
to
go
behind
a
post
or
anything
.
He
killed
me
.
I
would
've
laughed
,
but
I
was
afraid
I
'd
feel
like
vomiting
again
,
so
I
did
n't
.
``
Where
're
the
mummies
,
fella
?
''
the
kid
said
again
.
``
Ya
know
?
''
I
horsed
around
with
the
two
of
them
a
little
bit
.
``
The
mummies
?
What
're
they
?
''
I
asked
the
one
kid
.
``
You
know
.
The
mummies
--
them
dead
guys
.
That
get
buried
in
them
toons
and
all
.
''
Toons
.
That
killed
me
.
He
meant
tombs
.
``
How
come
you
two
guys
are
n't
in
school
?
''
I
said
.
``
No
school
t'day
,
''
the
kid
that
did
all
the
talking
said
.
He
was
lying
,
sure
as
I
'm
alive
,
the
little
bastard
.
I
did
n't
have
anything
to
do
,
though
,
till
old
Phoebe
showed
up
,
so
I
helped
them
find
the
place
where
the
mummies
were
.
Boy
,
I
used
to
know
exactly
where
they
were
,
but
I
had
n't
been
in
that
museum
in
years
.
``
You
two
guys
so
interested
in
mummies
?
''
I
said
.
``
Yeah
.
''
``
Ca
n't
your
friend
talk
?
''
I
said
.
``
He
ai
n't
my
friend
.
He
's
my
brudda
.
''
``
Ca
n't
he
talk
?
''
I
looked
at
the
one
that
was
n't
doing
any
talking
.
``
Ca
n't
you
talk
at
all
?
''
I
asked
him
.
``
Yeah
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
do
n't
feel
like
it
.
''
Finally
we
found
the
place
where
the
mummies
were
,
and
we
went
in
.
``
You
know
how
the
Egyptians
buried
their
dead
?
''
I
asked
the
one
kid
.
``
Naa
.
''
``
Well
,
you
should
.
It
's
very
interesting
.
They
wrapped
their
faces
up
in
these
cloths
that
were
treated
with
some
secret
chemical
.
That
way
they
could
be
buried
in
their
tombs
for
thousands
of
years
and
their
faces
would
n't
rot
or
anything
.
Nobody
knows
how
to
do
it
except
the
Egyptians
.
Even
modern
science
.
''
To
get
to
where
the
mummies
were
,
you
had
to
go
down
this
very
narrow
sort
of
hall
with
stones
on
the
side
that
they
'd
taken
right
out
of
this
Pharaoh
's
tomb
and
all
.
It
was
pretty
spooky
,
and
you
could
tell
the
two
hot-shots
I
was
with
were
n't
enjoying
it
too
much
.
They
stuck
close
as
hell
to
me
,
and
the
one
that
did
n't
talk
at
all
practically
was
holding
onto
my
sleeve
.
``
Let
's
go
,
''
he
said
to
his
brother
.
``
I
seen
'em
awreddy
.
C'mon
,
hey
.
''
He
turned
around
and
beat
it
.
``
He
's
got
a
yella
streak
a
mile
wide
,
''
the
other
one
said
.
``
So
long
!
''
He
beat
it
too
.
I
was
the
only
one
left
in
the
tomb
then
.
I
sort
of
liked
it
,
in
a
way
.
It
was
so
nice
and
peaceful
.
Then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
you
'd
never
guess
what
I
saw
on
the
wall
.
Another
``
Fuck
you
.
''
It
was
written
with
a
red
crayon
or
something
,
right
under
the
glass
part
of
the
wall
,
under
the
stones
.
That
's
the
whole
trouble
.
You
ca
n't
ever
find
a
place
that
's
nice
and
peaceful
,
because
there
is
n't
any
.
You
may
think
there
is
,
but
once
you
get
there
,
when
you
're
not
looking
,
somebody
'll
sneak
up
and
write
``
Fuck
you
''
right
under
your
nose
.
Try
it
sometime
.
I
think
,
even
,
if
I
ever
die
,
and
they
stick
me
in
a
cemetery
,
and
I
have
a
tombstone
and
all
,
it
'll
say
``
Holden
Caulfield
''
on
it
,
and
then
what
year
I
was
born
and
what
year
I
died
,
and
then
right
under
that
it
'll
say
``
Fuck
you
.
''
I
'm
positive
,
in
fact
.
After
I
came
out
of
the
place
where
the
mummies
were
,
I
had
to
go
to
the
bathroom
.
I
sort
of
had
diarrhea
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
I
did
n't
mind
the
diarrhea
part
too
much
,
but
something
else
happened
.
When
I
was
coming
out
of
the
can
,
right
before
I
got
to
the
door
,
I
sort
of
passed
out
.
I
was
lucky
,
though
.
I
mean
I
could
've
killed
myself
when
I
hit
the
floor
,
but
all
I
did
was
sort
of
land
on
my
side
.
it
was
a
funny
thing
,
though
.
I
felt
better
after
I
passed
out
.
I
really
did
.
My
arm
sort
of
hurt
,
from
where
I
fell
,
but
I
did
n't
feel
so
damn
dizzy
any
more
.
It
was
about
ten
after
twelve
or
so
then
,
and
so
I
went
back
and
stood
by
the
door
and
waited
for
old
Phoebe
.
I
thought
how
it
might
be
the
last
time
I
'd
ever
see
her
again
.
Any
of
my
relatives
,
I
mean
.
I
figured
I
'd
probably
see
them
again
,
but
not
for
years
.
I
might
come
home
when
I
was
about
thirty-five
.
I
figured
,
in
case
somebody
got
sick
and
wanted
to
see
me
before
they
died
,
but
that
would
be
the
only
reason
I
'd
leave
my
cabin
and
come
back
.
I
even
started
picturing
how
it
would
be
when
I
came
back
.
I
knew
my
mother
'd
get
nervous
as
hell
and
start
to
cry
and
beg
me
to
stay
home
and
not
go
back
to
my
cabin
,
but
I
'd
go
anyway
.
I
'd
be
casual
as
hell
.
I
'd
make
her
calm
down
,
and
then
I
'd
go
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
living
room
and
take
out
this
cigarette
case
and
light
a
cigarette
,
cool
as
all
hell
.
I
'd
ask
them
all
to
visit
me
sometime
if
they
wanted
to
,
but
I
would
n't
insist
or
anything
.
What
I
'd
do
,
I
'd
let
old
Phoebe
come
out
and
visit
me
in
the
summertime
and
on
Christmas
vacation
and
Easter
vacation
.
And
I
'd
let
D.B
.
come
out
and
visit
me
for
a
while
if
he
wanted
a
nice
,
quiet
place
for
his
writing
,
but
he
could
n't
write
any
movies
in
my
cabin
,
only
stories
and
books
.
I
'd
have
this
rule
that
nobody
could
do
anything
phony
when
they
visited
me
.
If
anybody
tried
to
do
anything
phony
,
they
could
n't
stay
.
All
of
a
sudden
I
looked
at
the
clock
in
the
checkroom
and
it
was
twenty-five
of
one
.
I
began
to
get
scared
that
maybe
that
old
lady
in
the
school
had
told
that
other
lady
not
to
give
old
Phoebe
my
message
.
I
began
to
get
scared
that
maybe
she
'd
told
her
to
burn
it
or
something
.
It
really
scared
hell
out
of
me
.
I
really
wanted
to
see
old
Phoebe
before
I
hit
the
road
.
I
mean
I
had
her
Christmas
dough
and
all
.
Finally
,
I
saw
her
.
I
saw
her
through
the
glass
part
of
the
door
.
The
reason
I
saw
her
,
she
had
my
crazy
hunting
hat
on
--
you
could
see
that
hat
about
ten
miles
away
.
I
went
out
the
doors
and
started
down
these
stone
stairs
to
meet
her
.
The
thing
I
could
n't
understand
,
she
had
this
big
suitcase
with
her
.
She
was
just
coming
across
Fifth
Avenue
,
and
she
was
dragging
this
goddam
big
suitcase
with
her
.
She
could
hardly
drag
it
.
When
I
got
up
closer
,
I
saw
it
was
my
old
suitcase
,
the
one
I
used
to
use
when
I
was
at
Whooton
.
I
could
n't
figure
out
what
the
hell
she
was
doing
with
it
.
``
Hi
,
''
she
said
when
she
got
up
close
.
She
was
all
out
of
breath
from
that
crazy
suitcase
.
``
I
thought
maybe
you
were
n't
coming
,
''
I
said
.
``
What
the
hell
's
in
that
bag
?
I
do
n't
need
anything
.
I
'm
just
going
the
way
I
am
.
I
'm
not
even
taking
the
bags
I
got
at
the
station
.
What
the
hellya
got
in
there
?
''
She
put
the
suitcase
down
.
``
My
clothes
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'm
going
with
you
.
Can
I
?
Okay
?
''
``
What
?
''
I
said
.
I
almost
fell
over
when
she
said
that
.
I
swear
to
God
I
did
.
I
got
sort
of
dizzy
and
I
thought
I
was
going
to
pass
out
or
something
again
.
``
I
took
them
down
the
back
elevator
so
Charlene
would
n't
see
me
.
It
is
n't
heavy
.
All
I
have
in
it
is
two
dresses
and
my
moccasins
and
my
underwear
and
socks
and
some
other
things
.
Feel
it
.
It
is
n't
heavy
.
Feel
it
once
.
.
.
Ca
n't
I
go
with
you
?
Holden
?
Ca
n't
I
?
Please
.
''
``
No
.
Shut
up
.
''
I
thought
I
was
going
to
pass
out
cold
.
I
mean
I
did
n't
mean
to
tell
her
to
shut
up
and
all
,
but
I
thought
I
was
going
to
pass
out
again
.
``
Why
ca
n't
I
?
Please
,
Holden
!
I
wo
n't
do
anything
--
I
'll
just
go
with
you
,
that
's
all
!
I
wo
n't
even
take
my
clothes
with
me
if
you
do
n't
want
me
to
--
I
'll
just
take
my
--
''
``
You
ca
n't
take
anything
.
Because
you
're
not
going
.
I
'm
going
alone
.
So
shut
up
.
''
``
Please
,
Holden
.
Please
let
me
go
.
I
'll
be
very
,
very
,
very
--
You
wo
n't
even
--
''
``
You
're
not
going
.
Now
,
shut
up
!
Gim
me
that
bag
,
''
I
said
.
I
took
the
bag
off
her
.
I
was
almost
all
set
to
hit
her
,
I
thought
I
was
going
to
smack
her
for
a
second
.
I
really
did
.
She
started
to
cry
.
``
I
thought
you
were
supposed
to
be
in
a
play
at
school
and
all
I
thought
you
were
supposed
to
be
Benedict
Arnold
in
that
play
and
all
,
''
I
said
.
I
said
it
very
nasty
.
``
Whuddaya
want
to
do
?
Not
be
in
the
play
,
for
God
's
sake
?
''
That
made
her
cry
even
harder
.
I
was
glad
.
All
of
a
sudden
I
wanted
her
to
cry
till
her
eyes
practically
dropped
out
.
I
almost
hated
her
.
I
think
I
hated
her
most
because
she
would
n't
be
in
that
play
any
more
if
she
went
away
with
me
.
``
Come
on
,
''
I
said
.
I
started
up
the
steps
to
the
museum
again
.
I
figured
what
I
'd
do
was
,
I
'd
check
the
crazy
suitcase
she
'd
brought
in
the
checkroom
,
andy
then
she
could
get
it
again
at
three
o'clock
,
after
school
.
I
knew
she
could
n't
take
it
back
to
school
with
her
.
``
Come
on
,
now
,
''
I
said
.
She
did
n't
go
up
the
steps
with
me
,
though
.
She
would
n't
come
with
me
.
I
went
up
anyway
,
though
,
and
brought
the
bag
in
the
checkroom
and
checked
it
,
and
then
I
came
down
again
.
She
was
still
standing
there
on
the
sidewalk
,
but
she
turned
her
back
on
me
when
I
came
up
to
her
.
She
can
do
that
.
She
can
turn
her
back
on
you
when
she
feels
like
it
.
``
I
'm
not
going
away
anywhere
.
I
changed
my
mind
.
So
stop
crying
,
and
shut
up
,
''
I
said
.
The
funny
part
was
,
she
was
n't
even
crying
when
I
said
that
.
I
said
it
anyway
,
though
,
``
C'mon
,
now
.
I
'll
walk
you
back
to
school
.
C'mon
,
now
.
You
'll
be
late
.
''
She
would
n't
answer
me
or
anything
.
I
sort
of
tried
to
get
hold
of
her
old
hand
,
but
she
would
n't
let
me
.
She
kept
turning
around
on
me
.
``
Didja
have
your
lunch
?
Ya
had
your
lunch
yet
?
''
I
asked
her
.
She
would
n't
answer
me
.
All
she
did
was
,
she
took
off
my
red
hunting
hat
--
the
one
I
gave
her
--
and
practically
chucked
it
right
in
my
face
.
Then
she
turned
her
back
on
me
again
.
It
nearly
killed
me
,
but
I
did
n't
say
anything
.
I
just
picked
it
up
and
stuck
it
in
my
coat
pocket
.
``
Come
on
,
hey
.
I
'll
walk
you
back
to
school
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
'm
not
going
back
to
school
.
''
I
did
n't
know
what
to
say
when
she
said
that
.
I
just
stood
there
for
a
couple
of
minutes
.
``
You
have
to
go
back
to
school
.
You
want
to
be
in
that
play
,
do
n't
you
?
You
want
to
be
Benedict
Arnold
,
do
n't
you
?
''
``
No
.
''
``
Sure
you
do
.
Certainly
you
do
.
C'mon
,
now
,
let
's
go
,
''
I
said
.
``
In
the
first
place
,
I
'm
not
going
away
anywhere
,
I
told
you
.
I
'm
going
home
.
I
'm
going
home
as
soon
as
you
go
back
to
school
.
First
I
'm
gon
na
go
down
to
the
station
and
get
my
bags
,
and
then
I
'm
gon
na
go
straight
--
''
``
I
said
I
'm
not
going
back
to
school
.
You
can
do
what
you
want
to
do
,
but
I
'm
not
going
back
to
chool
,
''
she
said
.
``
So
shut
up
.
''
It
was
the
first
time
she
ever
told
me
to
shut
up
.
It
sounded
terrible
.
God
,
it
sounded
terrible
.
It
sounded
worse
than
swearing
.
She
still
would
n't
look
at
me
either
,
and
every
time
I
sort
of
put
my
hand
on
her
shoulder
or
something
,
she
would
n't
let
me
.
``
Listen
,
do
you
want
to
go
for
a
walk
?
''
I
asked
her
.
``
Do
you
want
to
take
a
walk
down
to
the
zoo
?
If
I
let
you
not
go
back
to
school
this
afternoon
and
go
for
walk
,
will
you
cut
out
this
crazy
stuff
?
''
She
would
n't
answer
me
,
so
I
said
it
over
again
.
``
If
I
let
you
skip
school
this
afternoon
and
go
for
a
little
walk
,
will
you
cut
out
the
crazy
stuff
?
Will
you
go
back
to
school
tomorrow
like
a
good
girl
?
''
``
I
may
and
I
may
not
,
''
she
said
.
Then
she
ran
right
the
hell
across
the
street
,
without
even
looking
to
see
if
any
cars
were
coming
.
She
's
a
madman
sometimes
.
I
did
n't
follow
her
,
though
.
I
knew
she
'd
follow
me
,
so
I
started
walking
downtown
toward
the
zoo
,
on
the
park
side
of
the
street
,
and
she
started
walking
downtown
on
the
other
goddam
side
of
the
street
,
She
would
n't
look
over
at
me
at
all
,
but
I
could
tell
she
was
probably
watching
me
out
of
the
corner
of
her
crazy
eye
to
see
where
I
was
going
and
all
.
Anyway
,
we
kept
walking
that
way
all
the
way
to
the
zoo
.
The
only
thing
that
bothered
me
was
when
a
double-decker
bus
came
along
because
then
I
could
n't
see
across
the
street
and
I
could
n't
see
where
the
hell
she
was
.
But
when
we
got
to
the
zoo
,
I
yelled
over
to
her
,
``
Phoebe
!
I
'm
going
in
the
zoo
!
C'mon
,
now
!
''
She
would
n't
look
at
me
,
but
I
could
tell
she
heard
me
,
and
when
I
started
down
the
steps
to
the
zoo
I
turned
around
and
saw
she
was
crossing
the
street
and
following
me
and
all
.
There
were
n't
too
many
people
in
the
zoo
because
it
was
sort
of
a
lousy
day
,
but
there
were
a
few
around
the
sea
lions
'
swimming
pool
and
all
.
I
started
to
go
by
but
old
Phoebe
stopped
and
made
out
she
was
watching
the
sea
lions
getting
fed
--
a
guy
was
throwing
fish
at
them
--
so
I
went
back
.
I
figured
it
was
a
good
chance
to
catch
up
with
her
and
all
.
I
went
up
and
sort
of
stood
behind
her
and
sort
of
put
my
hands
on
her
shoulders
,
but
she
bent
her
knees
and
slid
out
from
me
--
she
can
certainly
be
very
snotty
when
she
wants
to
.
She
kept
standing
there
while
the
sea
lions
were
getting
fed
and
I
stood
right
behind
her
.
I
did
n't
put
my
hands
on
her
shoulders
again
or
anything
because
if
I
had
she
really
would
've
beat
it
on
me
.
Kids
are
funny
.
You
have
to
watch
what
you
're
doing
.
She
would
n't
walk
right
next
to
me
when
we
left
the
sea
lions
,
but
she
did
n't
walk
too
far
away
.
She
sort
of
walked
on
one
side
of
the
sidewalk
and
I
walked
on
the
other
side
.
It
was
n't
too
gorgeous
,
but
it
was
better
than
having
her
walk
about
a
mile
away
from
me
,
like
before
.
We
went
up
and
watched
the
bears
,
on
that
little
hill
,
for
a
while
,
but
there
was
n't
much
to
watch
.
Only
one
of
the
bears
was
out
,
the
polar
bear
.
The
other
one
,
the
brown
one
,
was
in
his
goddam
cave
and
would
n't
come
out
.
All
you
could
see
was
his
rear
end
.
There
was
a
little
kid
standing
next
to
me
,
with
a
cowboy
hat
on
practically
over
his
ears
,
and
he
kept
telling
his
father
,
``
Make
him
come
out
,
Daddy
.
Make
him
come
out
.
''
I
looked
at
old
Phoebe
,
but
she
would
n't
laugh
.
You
know
kids
when
they
're
sore
at
you
.
They
wo
n't
laugh
or
anything
.
After
we
left
the
bears
,
we
left
the
zoo
and
crossed
over
this
little
street
in
the
park
,
and
then
we
went
through
one
of
those
little
tunnels
that
always
smell
from
somebody
's
taking
a
leak
.
It
was
on
the
way
to
the
carrousel
.
Old
Phoebe
still
would
n't
talk
to
me
or
anything
,
but
she
was
sort
of
walking
next
to
me
now
.
I
took
a
hold
of
the
belt
at
the
back
of
her
coat
,
just
for
the
hell
of
it
,
but
she
would
n't
let
me
.
She
said
,
``
Keep
your
hands
to
yourself
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
.
''
She
was
still
sore
at
me
.
But
not
as
sore
as
she
was
before
.
Anyway
,
we
kept
getting
closer
and
closer
to
the
carrousel
and
you
could
start
to
hear
that
nutty
music
it
always
plays
.
It
was
playing
``
Oh
,
Marie
!
''
It
played
that
same
song
about
fifty
years
ago
when
I
was
a
little
kid
.
That
's
one
nice
thing
about
carrousels
,
they
always
play
the
same
songs
.
``
I
thought
the
carrousel
was
closed
in
the
wintertime
,
''
old
Phoebe
said
.
It
was
the
first
time
she
practically
said
anything
.
She
probably
forgot
she
was
supposed
to
be
sore
at
me
.
``
Maybe
because
it
's
around
Christmas
,
''
I
said
.
She
did
n't
say
anything
when
I
said
that
.
She
probably
remembered
she
was
supposed
to
be
sore
at
me
.
``
Do
you
want
to
go
for
a
ride
on
it
?
''
I
said
.
I
knew
she
probably
did
.
When
she
was
a
tiny
little
kid
,
and
Allie
and
D.B
.
and
I
used
to
go
to
the
park
with
her
,
she
was
mad
about
the
carrousel
.
You
could
n't
get
her
off
the
goddam
thing
.
``
I
'm
too
big
.
''
she
said
.
I
thought
she
was
n't
going
to
answer
me
,
but
she
did
.
``
No
,
you
're
not
.
Go
on
.
I
'll
wait
for
ya
.
Go
on
,
''
I
said
.
We
were
right
there
then
.
There
were
a
few
kids
riding
on
it
,
mostly
very
little
kids
,
and
a
few
parents
were
waiting
around
outside
,
sitting
on
the
benches
and
all
.
What
I
did
was
,
I
went
up
to
the
window
where
they
sell
the
tickets
and
bought
old
Phoebe
a
ticket
.
Then
I
gave
it
to
her
.
She
was
standing
right
next
to
me
.
``
Here
,
''
I
said
.
``
Wait
a
second
--
take
the
rest
of
your
dough
,
too
.
''
I
started
giving
her
the
rest
of
the
dough
she
'd
lent
me
.
``
You
keep
it
.
Keep
it
for
me
,
''
she
said
.
Then
she
said
right
afterward
--
''
Please
.
''
That
's
depressing
,
when
somebody
says
``
please
''
to
you
.
I
mean
if
it
's
Phoebe
or
somebody
.
That
depressed
the
hell
out
of
me
.
But
I
put
the
dough
back
in
my
pocket
.
``
Are
n't
you
gon
na
ride
,
too
?
''
she
asked
me
.
She
was
looking
at
me
sort
of
funny
.
You
could
tell
she
was
n't
too
sore
at
me
any
more
.
``
Maybe
I
will
the
next
time
.
I
'll
watch
ya
,
''
I
said
.
``
Got
your
ticket
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
``
Go
ahead
,
then
--
I
'll
be
on
this
bench
right
over
here
.
I
'll
watch
ya
.
''
I
went
over
and
sat
down
on
this
bench
,
and
she
went
and
got
on
the
carrousel
.
She
walked
all
around
it
.
I
mean
she
walked
once
all
the
way
around
it
.
Then
she
sat
down
on
this
big
,
brown
,
beat-up-looking
old
horse
.
Then
the
carrousel
started
,
and
I
watched
her
go
around
and
around
.
There
were
only
about
five
or
six
other
kids
on
the
ride
,
and
the
song
the
carrousel
was
playing
was
``
Smoke
Gets
in
Your
Eyes
.
''
It
was
playing
it
very
jazzy
and
funny
.
All
the
kids
kept
trying
to
grab
for
the
gold
ring
,
and
so
was
old
Phoebe
,
and
I
was
sort
of
afraid
she
'd
fall
off
the
goddam
horse
,
but
I
did
n't
say
anything
or
do
anything
.
The
thing
with
kids
is
,
if
they
want
to
grab
the
gold
ring
,
you
have
to
let
them
do
it
,
and
not
say
anything
.
If
they
fall
off
they
fall
off
,
but
it
's
bad
if
you
say
anything
to
them
.
When
the
ride
was
over
she
got
off
her
horse
and
came
over
to
me
.
``
You
ride
once
,
too
,
this
time
,
''
she
said
.
``
No
,
I
'll
just
watch
ya
.
I
think
I
'll
just
watch
,
''
I
said
.
I
gave
her
some
more
of
her
dough
.
``
Here
.
Get
some
more
tickets
.
''
She
took
the
dough
off
me
.
``
I
'm
not
mad
at
you
any
more
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
know
.
Hurry
up
--
the
thing
's
gon
na
start
again
.
''
Then
all
of
a
sudden
she
gave
me
a
kiss
.
Then
she
held
her
hand
out
,
and
said
,
``
It
's
raining
.
It
's
starting
to
rain
.
''
``
I
know
.
''
Then
what
she
did
--
it
damn
near
killed
me
--
she
reached
in
my
coat
pocket
and
took
out
my
red
hunting
hat
and
put
it
on
my
head
.
``
Do
n't
you
want
it
?
''
I
said
.
``
You
can
wear
it
a
while
.
''
``
Okay
.
Hurry
up
,
though
,
now
.
You
're
gon
na
miss
your
ride
.
You
wo
n't
get
your
own
horse
or
anything
.
''
She
kept
hanging
around
,
though
.
``
Did
you
mean
it
what
you
said
?
You
really
are
n't
going
away
anywhere
?
Are
you
really
going
home
afterwards
?
''
she
asked
me
.
``
Yeah
,
''
I
said
.
I
meant
it
,
too
.
I
was
n't
lying
to
her
.
I
really
did
go
home
afterwards
.
``
Hurry
up
,
now
,
''
I
said
.
``
The
thing
's
starting
.
''
She
ran
and
bought
her
ticket
and
got
back
on
the
goddam
carrousel
just
in
time
.
Then
she
walked
all
the
way
around
it
till
she
got
her
own
horse
back
.
Then
she
got
on
it
.
She
waved
to
me
and
I
waved
back
.
Boy
,
it
began
to
rain
like
a
bastard
.
In
buckets
,
I
swear
to
God
.
All
the
parents
and
mothers
and
everybody
went
over
and
stood
right
under
the
roof
of
the
carrousel
,
so
they
would
n't
get
soaked
to
the
skin
or
anything
,
but
I
stuck
around
on
the
bench
for
quite
a
while
.
I
got
pretty
soaking
wet
,
especially
my
neck
and
my
pants
.
My
hunting
hat
really
gave
me
quite
a
lot
of
protection
,
in
a
way
;
but
I
got
soaked
anyway
.
I
did
n't
care
,
though
.
I
felt
so
damn
happy
all
of
sudden
,
the
way
old
Phoebe
kept
going
around
and
around
.
I
was
damn
near
bawling
,
I
felt
so
damn
happy
,
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
.
I
do
n't
know
why
.
It
was
just
that
she
looked
so
damn
nice
,
the
way
she
kept
going
around
and
around
,
in
her
blue
coat
and
all
.
God
,
I
wish
you
could
've
been
there
.
26
That
's
all
I
'm
going
to
tell
about
.
I
could
probably
tell
you
what
I
did
after
I
went
home
,
and
how
I
got
sick
and
all
,
and
what
school
I
'm
supposed
to
go
to
next
fall
,
after
I
get
out
of
here
,
but
I
do
n't
feel
like
it
.
I
really
do
n't
.
That
stuff
does
n't
interest
me
too
much
right
now
.
A
lot
of
people
,
especially
this
one
psychoanalyst
guy
they
have
here
,
keeps
asking
me
if
I
'm
going
apply
myself
when
I
go
back
to
school
next
September
.
It
's
such
a
stupid
question
,
in
my
opinion
.
I
mean
how
do
you
know
what
you
're
going
to
do
till
you
do
it
?
The
answer
is
,
you
do
n't
.
I
think
I
am
,
but
how
do
I
know
?
I
swear
it
's
a
stupid
question
.
D.B
.
is
n't
as
bad
as
the
rest
of
them
,
but
he
keeps
asking
me
a
lot
of
questions
,
too
.
He
drove
over
last
Saturday
with
this
English
babe
that
's
in
this
new
picture
he
's
writing
.
She
was
pretty
affected
,
but
very
good-looking
.
Anyway
,
one
time
when
she
went
to
the
ladies
'
room
way
the
hell
down
in
the
other
wing
D.B
.
asked
me
what
I
thought
about
all
this
stuff
I
just
finished
telling
you
about
.
I
did
n't
know
what
the
hell
to
say
.
If
you
want
to
know
the
truth
,
I
do
n't
know
what
I
think
about
it
.
I
'm
sorry
I
told
so
many
people
about
it
.
About
all
I
know
is
,
I
sort
of
miss
everybody
I
told
about
.
Even
old
Stradlater
and
Ackley
,
for
instance
.
I
think
I
even
miss
that
goddam
Maurice
.
It
's
funny
.
Do
n't
ever
tell
anybody
anything
.
If
you
do
,
you
start
missing
everybody
.
Mrs.
Dalloway
said
she
would
buy
the
flowers
herself
.
For
Lucy
had
her
work
cut
out
for
her
.
The
doors
would
be
taken
off
their
hinges
;
Rumpelmayer
's
men
were
coming
.
And
then
,
thought
Clarissa
Dalloway
,
what
a
morning
--
fresh
as
if
issued
to
children
on
a
beach
.
What
a
lark
!
What
a
plunge
!
For
so
it
had
always
seemed
to
her
,
when
,
with
a
little
squeak
of
the
hinges
,
which
she
could
hear
now
,
she
had
burst
open
the
French
windows
and
plunged
at
Bourton
into
the
open
air
.
How
fresh
,
how
calm
,
stiller
than
this
of
course
,
the
air
was
in
the
early
morning
;
like
the
flap
of
a
wave
;
the
kiss
of
a
wave
;
chill
and
sharp
and
yet
(
for
a
girl
of
eighteen
as
she
then
was
)
solemn
,
feeling
as
she
did
,
standing
there
at
the
open
window
,
that
something
awful
was
about
to
happen
;
looking
at
the
flowers
,
at
the
trees
with
the
smoke
winding
off
them
and
the
rooks
rising
,
falling
;
standing
and
looking
until
Peter
Walsh
said
,
``
Musing
among
the
vegetables
?
''
--
was
that
it
?
--
''
I
prefer
men
to
cauliflowers
''
--
was
that
it
?
He
must
have
said
it
at
breakfast
one
morning
when
she
had
gone
out
on
to
the
terrace
--
Peter
Walsh
.
He
would
be
back
from
India
one
of
these
days
,
June
or
July
,
she
forgot
which
,
for
his
letters
were
awfully
dull
;
it
was
his
sayings
one
remembered
;
his
eyes
,
his
pocket-knife
,
his
smile
,
his
grumpiness
and
,
when
millions
of
things
had
utterly
vanished
--
how
strange
it
was
!
--
a
few
sayings
like
this
about
cabbages
.
She
stiffened
a
little
on
the
kerb
,
waiting
for
Durtnall
's
van
to
pass
.
A
charming
woman
,
Scrope
Purvis
thought
her
(
knowing
her
as
one
does
know
people
who
live
next
door
to
one
in
Westminster
)
;
a
touch
of
the
bird
about
her
,
of
the
jay
,
blue-green
,
light
,
vivacious
,
though
she
was
over
fifty
,
and
grown
very
white
since
her
illness
.
There
she
perched
,
never
seeing
him
,
waiting
to
cross
,
very
upright
.
For
having
lived
in
Westminster
--
how
many
years
now
?
over
twenty
,
--
one
feels
even
in
the
midst
of
the
traffic
,
or
waking
at
night
,
Clarissa
was
positive
,
a
particular
hush
,
or
solemnity
;
an
indescribable
pause
;
a
suspense
(
but
that
might
be
her
heart
,
affected
,
they
said
,
by
influenza
)
before
Big
Ben
strikes
.
There
!
Out
it
boomed
.
First
a
warning
,
musical
;
then
the
hour
,
irrevocable
.
The
leaden
circles
dissolved
in
the
air
.
Such
fools
we
are
,
she
thought
,
crossing
Victoria
Street
.
For
Heaven
only
knows
why
one
loves
it
so
,
how
one
sees
it
so
,
making
it
up
,
building
it
round
one
,
tumbling
it
,
creating
it
every
moment
afresh
;
but
the
veriest
frumps
,
the
most
dejected
of
miseries
sitting
on
doorsteps
(
drink
their
downfall
)
do
the
same
;
ca
n't
be
dealt
with
,
she
felt
positive
,
by
Acts
of
Parliament
for
that
very
reason
:
they
love
life
.
In
people
's
eyes
,
in
the
swing
,
tramp
,
and
trudge
;
in
the
bellow
and
the
uproar
;
the
carriages
,
motor
cars
,
omnibuses
,
vans
,
sandwich
men
shuffling
and
swinging
;
brass
bands
;
barrel
organs
;
in
the
triumph
and
the
jingle
and
the
strange
high
singing
of
some
aeroplane
overhead
was
what
she
loved
;
life
;
London
;
this
moment
of
June
.
For
it
was
the
middle
of
June
.
The
War
was
over
,
except
for
some
one
like
Mrs.
Foxcroft
at
the
Embassy
last
night
eating
her
heart
out
because
that
nice
boy
was
killed
and
now
the
old
Manor
House
must
go
to
a
cousin
;
or
Lady
Bexborough
who
opened
a
bazaar
,
they
said
,
with
the
telegram
in
her
hand
,
John
,
her
favourite
,
killed
;
but
it
was
over
;
thank
Heaven
--
over
.
It
was
June
.
The
King
and
Queen
were
at
the
Palace
.
And
everywhere
,
though
it
was
still
so
early
,
there
was
a
beating
,
a
stirring
of
galloping
ponies
,
tapping
of
cricket
bats
;
Lords
,
Ascot
,
Ranelagh
and
all
the
rest
of
it
;
wrapped
in
the
soft
mesh
of
the
grey-blue
morning
air
,
which
,
as
the
day
wore
on
,
would
unwind
them
,
and
set
down
on
their
lawns
and
pitches
the
bouncing
ponies
,
whose
forefeet
just
struck
the
ground
and
up
they
sprung
,
the
whirling
young
men
,
and
laughing
girls
in
their
transparent
muslins
who
,
even
now
,
after
dancing
all
night
,
were
taking
their
absurd
woolly
dogs
for
a
run
;
and
even
now
,
at
this
hour
,
discreet
old
dowagers
were
shooting
out
in
their
motor
cars
on
errands
of
mystery
;
and
the
shopkeepers
were
fidgeting
in
their
windows
with
their
paste
and
diamonds
,
their
lovely
old
sea-green
brooches
in
eighteenth-century
settings
to
tempt
Americans
(
but
one
must
economise
,
not
buy
things
rashly
for
Elizabeth
)
,
and
she
,
too
,
loving
it
as
she
did
with
an
absurd
and
faithful
passion
,
being
part
of
it
,
since
her
people
were
courtiers
once
in
the
time
of
the
Georges
,
she
,
too
,
was
going
that
very
night
to
kindle
and
illuminate
;
to
give
her
party
.
But
how
strange
,
on
entering
the
Park
,
the
silence
;
the
mist
;
the
hum
;
the
slow-swimming
happy
ducks
;
the
pouched
birds
waddling
;
and
who
should
be
coming
along
with
his
back
against
the
Government
buildings
,
most
appropriately
,
carrying
a
despatch
box
stamped
with
the
Royal
Arms
,
who
but
Hugh
Whitbread
;
her
old
friend
Hugh
--
the
admirable
Hugh
!
``
Good-morning
to
you
,
Clarissa
!
''
said
Hugh
,
rather
extravagantly
,
for
they
had
known
each
other
as
children
.
``
Where
are
you
off
to
?
''
``
I
love
walking
in
London
,
''
said
Mrs.
Dalloway
.
``
Really
it
's
better
than
walking
in
the
country
.
''
They
had
just
come
up
--
unfortunately
--
to
see
doctors
.
Other
people
came
to
see
pictures
;
go
to
the
opera
;
take
their
daughters
out
;
the
Whitbreads
came
``
to
see
doctors
.
''
Times
without
number
Clarissa
had
visited
Evelyn
Whitbread
in
a
nursing
home
.
Was
Evelyn
ill
again
?
Evelyn
was
a
good
deal
out
of
sorts
,
said
Hugh
,
intimating
by
a
kind
of
pout
or
swell
of
his
very
well-covered
,
manly
,
extremely
handsome
,
perfectly
upholstered
body
(
he
was
almost
too
well
dressed
always
,
but
presumably
had
to
be
,
with
his
little
job
at
Court
)
that
his
wife
had
some
internal
ailment
,
nothing
serious
,
which
,
as
an
old
friend
,
Clarissa
Dalloway
would
quite
understand
without
requiring
him
to
specify
.
Ah
yes
,
she
did
of
course
;
what
a
nuisance
;
and
felt
very
sisterly
and
oddly
conscious
at
the
same
time
of
her
hat
.
Not
the
right
hat
for
the
early
morning
,
was
that
it
?
For
Hugh
always
made
her
feel
,
as
he
bustled
on
,
raising
his
hat
rather
extravagantly
and
assuring
her
that
she
might
be
a
girl
of
eighteen
,
and
of
course
he
was
coming
to
her
party
to-night
,
Evelyn
absolutely
insisted
,
only
a
little
late
he
might
be
after
the
party
at
the
Palace
to
which
he
had
to
take
one
of
Jim
's
boys
,
--
she
always
felt
a
little
skimpy
beside
Hugh
;
schoolgirlish
;
but
attached
to
him
,
partly
from
having
known
him
always
,
but
she
did
think
him
a
good
sort
in
his
own
way
,
though
Richard
was
nearly
driven
mad
by
him
,
and
as
for
Peter
Walsh
,
he
had
never
to
this
day
forgiven
her
for
liking
him
.
She
could
remember
scene
after
scene
at
Bourton
--
Peter
furious
;
Hugh
not
,
of
course
,
his
match
in
any
way
,
but
still
not
a
positive
imbecile
as
Peter
made
out
;
not
a
mere
barber
's
block
.
When
his
old
mother
wanted
him
to
give
up
shooting
or
to
take
her
to
Bath
he
did
it
,
without
a
word
;
he
was
really
unselfish
,
and
as
for
saying
,
as
Peter
did
,
that
he
had
no
heart
,
no
brain
,
nothing
but
the
manners
and
breeding
of
an
English
gentleman
,
that
was
only
her
dear
Peter
at
his
worst
;
and
he
could
be
intolerable
;
he
could
be
impossible
;
but
adorable
to
walk
with
on
a
morning
like
this
.
(
June
had
drawn
out
every
leaf
on
the
trees
.
The
mothers
of
Pimlico
gave
suck
to
their
young
.
Messages
were
passing
from
the
Fleet
to
the
Admiralty
.
Arlington
Street
and
Piccadilly
seemed
to
chafe
the
very
air
in
the
Park
and
lift
its
leaves
hotly
,
brilliantly
,
on
waves
of
that
divine
vitality
which
Clarissa
loved
.
To
dance
,
to
ride
,
she
had
adored
all
that
.
)
For
they
might
be
parted
for
hundreds
of
years
,
she
and
Peter
;
she
never
wrote
a
letter
and
his
were
dry
sticks
;
but
suddenly
it
would
come
over
her
,
If
he
were
with
me
now
what
would
he
say
?
--
some
days
,
some
sights
bringing
him
back
to
her
calmly
,
without
the
old
bitterness
;
which
perhaps
was
the
reward
of
having
cared
for
people
;
they
came
back
in
the
middle
of
St.
James
's
Park
on
a
fine
morning
--
indeed
they
did
.
But
Peter
--
however
beautiful
the
day
might
be
,
and
the
trees
and
the
grass
,
and
the
little
girl
in
pink
--
Peter
never
saw
a
thing
of
all
that
.
He
would
put
on
his
spectacles
,
if
she
told
him
to
;
he
would
look
.
It
was
the
state
of
the
world
that
interested
him
;
Wagner
,
Pope
's
poetry
,
people
's
characters
eternally
,
and
the
defects
of
her
own
soul
.
How
he
scolded
her
!
How
they
argued
!
She
would
marry
a
Prime
Minister
and
stand
at
the
top
of
a
staircase
;
the
perfect
hostess
he
called
her
(
she
had
cried
over
it
in
her
bedroom
)
,
she
had
the
makings
of
the
perfect
hostess
,
he
said
.
So
she
would
still
find
herself
arguing
in
St.
James
's
Park
,
still
making
out
that
she
had
been
right
--
and
she
had
too
--
not
to
marry
him
.
For
in
marriage
a
little
licence
,
a
little
independence
there
must
be
between
people
living
together
day
in
day
out
in
the
same
house
;
which
Richard
gave
her
,
and
she
him
.
(
Where
was
he
this
morning
for
instance
?
Some
committee
,
she
never
asked
what
.
)
But
with
Peter
everything
had
to
be
shared
;
everything
gone
into
.
And
it
was
intolerable
,
and
when
it
came
to
that
scene
in
the
little
garden
by
the
fountain
,
she
had
to
break
with
him
or
they
would
have
been
destroyed
,
both
of
them
ruined
,
she
was
convinced
;
though
she
had
borne
about
with
her
for
years
like
an
arrow
sticking
in
her
heart
the
grief
,
the
anguish
;
and
then
the
horror
of
the
moment
when
some
one
told
her
at
a
concert
that
he
had
married
a
woman
met
on
the
boat
going
to
India
!
Never
should
she
forget
all
that
!
Cold
,
heartless
,
a
prude
,
he
called
her
.
Never
could
she
understand
how
he
cared
.
But
those
Indian
women
did
presumably
--
silly
,
pretty
,
flimsy
nincompoops
.
And
she
wasted
her
pity
.
For
he
was
quite
happy
,
he
assured
her
--
perfectly
happy
,
though
he
had
never
done
a
thing
that
they
talked
of
;
his
whole
life
had
been
a
failure
.
It
made
her
angry
still
.
She
had
reached
the
Park
gates
.
She
stood
for
a
moment
,
looking
at
the
omnibuses
in
Piccadilly
.
She
would
not
say
of
any
one
in
the
world
now
that
they
were
this
or
were
that
.
She
felt
very
young
;
at
the
same
time
unspeakably
aged
.
She
sliced
like
a
knife
through
everything
;
at
the
same
time
was
outside
,
looking
on
.
She
had
a
perpetual
sense
,
as
she
watched
the
taxi
cabs
,
of
being
out
,
out
,
far
out
to
sea
and
alone
;
she
always
had
the
feeling
that
it
was
very
,
very
dangerous
to
live
even
one
day
.
Not
that
she
thought
herself
clever
,
or
much
out
of
the
ordinary
.
How
she
had
got
through
life
on
the
few
twigs
of
knowledge
Fräulein
Daniels
gave
them
she
could
not
think
.
She
knew
nothing
;
no
language
,
no
history
;
she
scarcely
read
a
book
now
,
except
memoirs
in
bed
;
and
yet
to
her
it
was
absolutely
absorbing
;
all
this
;
the
cabs
passing
;
and
she
would
not
say
of
Peter
,
she
would
not
say
of
herself
,
I
am
this
,
I
am
that
.
Her
only
gift
was
knowing
people
almost
by
instinct
,
she
thought
,
walking
on
.
If
you
put
her
in
a
room
with
some
one
,
up
went
her
back
like
a
cat
's
;
or
she
purred
.
Devonshire
House
,
Bath
House
,
the
house
with
the
china
cockatoo
,
she
had
seen
them
all
lit
up
once
;
and
remembered
Sylvia
,
Fred
,
Sally
Seton
--
such
hosts
of
people
;
and
dancing
all
night
;
and
the
waggons
plodding
past
to
market
;
and
driving
home
across
the
Park
.
She
remembered
once
throwing
a
shilling
into
the
Serpentine
.
But
every
one
remembered
;
what
she
loved
was
this
,
here
,
now
,
in
front
of
her
;
the
fat
lady
in
the
cab
.
Did
it
matter
then
,
she
asked
herself
,
walking
towards
Bond
Street
,
did
it
matter
that
she
must
inevitably
cease
completely
;
all
this
must
go
on
without
her
;
did
she
resent
it
;
or
did
it
not
become
consoling
to
believe
that
death
ended
absolutely
?
but
that
somehow
in
the
streets
of
London
,
on
the
ebb
and
flow
of
things
,
here
,
there
,
she
survived
,
Peter
survived
,
lived
in
each
other
,
she
being
part
,
she
was
positive
,
of
the
trees
at
home
;
of
the
house
there
,
ugly
,
rambling
all
to
bits
and
pieces
as
it
was
;
part
of
people
she
had
never
met
;
being
laid
out
like
a
mist
between
the
people
she
knew
best
,
who
lifted
her
on
their
branches
as
she
had
seen
the
trees
lift
the
mist
,
but
it
spread
ever
so
far
,
her
life
,
herself
.
But
what
was
she
dreaming
as
she
looked
into
Hatchards
'
shop
window
?
What
was
she
trying
to
recover
?
What
image
of
white
dawn
in
the
country
,
as
she
read
in
the
book
spread
open
:
Fear
no
more
the
heat
o
'
the
sun
Nor
the
furious
winter
's
rages
.
This
late
age
of
the
world
's
experience
had
bred
in
them
all
,
all
men
and
women
,
a
well
of
tears
.
Tears
and
sorrows
;
courage
and
endurance
;
a
perfectly
upright
and
stoical
bearing
.
Think
,
for
example
,
of
the
woman
she
admired
most
,
Lady
Bexborough
,
opening
the
bazaar
.
There
were
Jorrocks
'
Jaunts
and
Jollities
;
there
were
Soapy
Sponge
and
Mrs.
Asquith
's
Memoirs
and
Big
Game
Shooting
in
Nigeria
,
all
spread
open
.
Ever
so
many
books
there
were
;
but
none
that
seemed
exactly
right
to
take
to
Evelyn
Whitbread
in
her
nursing
home
.
Nothing
that
would
serve
to
amuse
her
and
make
that
indescribably
dried-up
little
woman
look
,
as
Clarissa
came
in
,
just
for
a
moment
cordial
;
before
they
settled
down
for
the
usual
interminable
talk
of
women
's
ailments
.
How
much
she
wanted
it
--
that
people
should
look
pleased
as
she
came
in
,
Clarissa
thought
and
turned
and
walked
back
towards
Bond
Street
,
annoyed
,
because
it
was
silly
to
have
other
reasons
for
doing
things
.
Much
rather
would
she
have
been
one
of
those
people
like
Richard
who
did
things
for
themselves
,
whereas
,
she
thought
,
waiting
to
cross
,
half
the
time
she
did
things
not
simply
,
not
for
themselves
;
but
to
make
people
think
this
or
that
;
perfect
idiocy
she
knew
(
and
now
the
policeman
held
up
his
hand
)
for
no
one
was
ever
for
a
second
taken
in
.
Oh
if
she
could
have
had
her
life
over
again
!
she
thought
,
stepping
on
to
the
pavement
,
could
have
looked
even
differently
!
She
would
have
been
,
in
the
first
place
,
dark
like
Lady
Bexborough
,
with
a
skin
of
crumpled
leather
and
beautiful
eyes
.
She
would
have
been
,
like
Lady
Bexborough
,
slow
and
stately
;
rather
large
;
interested
in
politics
like
a
man
;
with
a
country
house
;
very
dignified
,
very
sincere
.
Instead
of
which
she
had
a
narrow
pea-stick
figure
;
a
ridiculous
little
face
,
beaked
like
a
bird
's
.
That
she
held
herself
well
was
true
;
and
had
nice
hands
and
feet
;
and
dressed
well
,
considering
that
she
spent
little
.
But
often
now
this
body
she
wore
(
she
stopped
to
look
at
a
Dutch
picture
)
,
this
body
,
with
all
its
capacities
,
seemed
nothing
--
nothing
at
all
.
She
had
the
oddest
sense
of
being
herself
invisible
;
unseen
;
unknown
;
there
being
no
more
marrying
,
no
more
having
of
children
now
,
but
only
this
astonishing
and
rather
solemn
progress
with
the
rest
of
them
,
up
Bond
Street
,
this
being
Mrs.
Dalloway
;
not
even
Clarissa
any
more
;
this
being
Mrs.
Richard
Dalloway
.
Bond
Street
fascinated
her
;
Bond
Street
early
in
the
morning
in
the
season
;
its
flags
flying
;
its
shops
;
no
splash
;
no
glitter
;
one
roll
of
tweed
in
the
shop
where
her
father
had
bought
his
suits
for
fifty
years
;
a
few
pearls
;
salmon
on
an
iceblock
.
``
That
is
all
,
''
she
said
,
looking
at
the
fishmonger
's
.
``
That
is
all
,
''
she
repeated
,
pausing
for
a
moment
at
the
window
of
a
glove
shop
where
,
before
the
War
,
you
could
buy
almost
perfect
gloves
.
And
her
old
Uncle
William
used
to
say
a
lady
is
known
by
her
shoes
and
her
gloves
.
He
had
turned
on
his
bed
one
morning
in
the
middle
of
the
War
.
He
had
said
,
``
I
have
had
enough
.
''
Gloves
and
shoes
;
she
had
a
passion
for
gloves
;
but
her
own
daughter
,
her
Elizabeth
,
cared
not
a
straw
for
either
of
them
.
Not
a
straw
,
she
thought
,
going
on
up
Bond
Street
to
a
shop
where
they
kept
flowers
for
her
when
she
gave
a
party
.
Elizabeth
really
cared
for
her
dog
most
of
all
.
The
whole
house
this
morning
smelt
of
tar
.
Still
,
better
poor
Grizzle
than
Miss
Kilman
;
better
distemper
and
tar
and
all
the
rest
of
it
than
sitting
mewed
in
a
stuffy
bedroom
with
a
prayer
book
!
Better
anything
,
she
was
inclined
to
say
.
But
it
might
be
only
a
phase
,
as
Richard
said
,
such
as
all
girls
go
through
.
It
might
be
falling
in
love
.
But
why
with
Miss
Kilman
?
who
had
been
badly
treated
of
course
;
one
must
make
allowances
for
that
,
and
Richard
said
she
was
very
able
,
had
a
really
historical
mind
.
Anyhow
they
were
inseparable
,
and
Elizabeth
,
her
own
daughter
,
went
to
Communion
;
and
how
she
dressed
,
how
she
treated
people
who
came
to
lunch
she
did
not
care
a
bit
,
it
being
her
experience
that
the
religious
ecstasy
made
people
callous
(
so
did
causes
)
;
dulled
their
feelings
,
for
Miss
Kilman
would
do
anything
for
the
Russians
,
starved
herself
for
the
Austrians
,
but
in
private
inflicted
positive
torture
,
so
insensitive
was
she
,
dressed
in
a
green
mackintosh
coat
.
Year
in
year
out
she
wore
that
coat
;
she
perspired
;
she
was
never
in
the
room
five
minutes
without
making
you
feel
her
superiority
,
your
inferiority
;
how
poor
she
was
;
how
rich
you
were
;
how
she
lived
in
a
slum
without
a
cushion
or
a
bed
or
a
rug
or
whatever
it
might
be
,
all
her
soul
rusted
with
that
grievance
sticking
in
it
,
her
dismissal
from
school
during
the
War
--
poor
embittered
unfortunate
creature
!
For
it
was
not
her
one
hated
but
the
idea
of
her
,
which
undoubtedly
had
gathered
in
to
itself
a
great
deal
that
was
not
Miss
Kilman
;
had
become
one
of
those
spectres
with
which
one
battles
in
the
night
;
one
of
those
spectres
who
stand
astride
us
and
suck
up
half
our
life-blood
,
dominators
and
tyrants
;
for
no
doubt
with
another
throw
of
the
dice
,
had
the
black
been
uppermost
and
not
the
white
,
she
would
have
loved
Miss
Kilman
!
But
not
in
this
world
.
No
.
It
rasped
her
,
though
,
to
have
stirring
about
in
her
this
brutal
monster
!
to
hear
twigs
cracking
and
feel
hooves
planted
down
in
the
depths
of
that
leaf-encumbered
forest
,
the
soul
;
never
to
be
content
quite
,
or
quite
secure
,
for
at
any
moment
the
brute
would
be
stirring
,
this
hatred
,
which
,
especially
since
her
illness
,
had
power
to
make
her
feel
scraped
,
hurt
in
her
spine
;
gave
her
physical
pain
,
and
made
all
pleasure
in
beauty
,
in
friendship
,
in
being
well
,
in
being
loved
and
making
her
home
delightful
rock
,
quiver
,
and
bend
as
if
indeed
there
were
a
monster
grubbing
at
the
roots
,
as
if
the
whole
panoply
of
content
were
nothing
but
self
love
!
this
hatred
!
Nonsense
,
nonsense
!
she
cried
to
herself
,
pushing
through
the
swing
doors
of
Mulberry
's
the
florists
.
She
advanced
,
light
,
tall
,
very
upright
,
to
be
greeted
at
once
by
button-faced
Miss
Pym
,
whose
hands
were
always
bright
red
,
as
if
they
had
been
stood
in
cold
water
with
the
flowers
.
There
were
flowers
:
delphiniums
,
sweet
peas
,
bunches
of
lilac
;
and
carnations
,
masses
of
carnations
.
There
were
roses
;
there
were
irises
.
Ah
yes
--
so
she
breathed
in
the
earthy
garden
sweet
smell
as
she
stood
talking
to
Miss
Pym
who
owed
her
help
,
and
thought
her
kind
,
for
kind
she
had
been
years
ago
;
very
kind
,
but
she
looked
older
,
this
year
,
turning
her
head
from
side
to
side
among
the
irises
and
roses
and
nodding
tufts
of
lilac
with
her
eyes
half
closed
,
snuffing
in
,
after
the
street
uproar
,
the
delicious
scent
,
the
exquisite
coolness
.
And
then
,
opening
her
eyes
,
how
fresh
like
frilled
linen
clean
from
a
laundry
laid
in
wicker
trays
the
roses
looked
;
and
dark
and
prim
the
red
carnations
,
holding
their
heads
up
;
and
all
the
sweet
peas
spreading
in
their
bowls
,
tinged
violet
,
snow
white
,
pale
--
as
if
it
were
the
evening
and
girls
in
muslin
frocks
came
out
to
pick
sweet
peas
and
roses
after
the
superb
summer
's
day
,
with
its
almost
blue-black
sky
,
its
delphiniums
,
its
carnations
,
its
arum
lilies
was
over
;
and
it
was
the
moment
between
six
and
seven
when
every
flower
--
roses
,
carnations
,
irises
,
lilac
--
glows
;
white
,
violet
,
red
,
deep
orange
;
every
flower
seems
to
burn
by
itself
,
softly
,
purely
in
the
misty
beds
;
and
how
she
loved
the
grey-white
moths
spinning
in
and
out
,
over
the
cherry
pie
,
over
the
evening
primroses
!
And
as
she
began
to
go
with
Miss
Pym
from
jar
to
jar
,
choosing
,
nonsense
,
nonsense
,
she
said
to
herself
,
more
and
more
gently
,
as
if
this
beauty
,
this
scent
,
this
colour
,
and
Miss
Pym
liking
her
,
trusting
her
,
were
a
wave
which
she
let
flow
over
her
and
surmount
that
hatred
,
that
monster
,
surmount
it
all
;
and
it
lifted
her
up
and
up
when
--
oh
!
a
pistol
shot
in
the
street
outside
!
``
Dear
,
those
motor
cars
,
''
said
Miss
Pym
,
going
to
the
window
to
look
,
and
coming
back
and
smiling
apologetically
with
her
hands
full
of
sweet
peas
,
as
if
those
motor
cars
,
those
tyres
of
motor
cars
,
were
all
her
fault
.
The
violent
explosion
which
made
Mrs.
Dalloway
jump
and
Miss
Pym
go
to
the
window
and
apologise
came
from
a
motor
car
which
had
drawn
to
the
side
of
the
pavement
precisely
opposite
Mulberry
's
shop
window
.
Passers-by
who
,
of
course
,
stopped
and
stared
,
had
just
time
to
see
a
face
of
the
very
greatest
importance
against
the
dove-grey
upholstery
,
before
a
male
hand
drew
the
blind
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
except
a
square
of
dove
grey
.
Yet
rumours
were
at
once
in
circulation
from
the
middle
of
Bond
Street
to
Oxford
Street
on
one
side
,
to
Atkinson
's
scent
shop
on
the
other
,
passing
invisibly
,
inaudibly
,
like
a
cloud
,
swift
,
veil-like
upon
hills
,
falling
indeed
with
something
of
a
cloud
's
sudden
sobriety
and
stillness
upon
faces
which
a
second
before
had
been
utterly
disorderly
.
But
now
mystery
had
brushed
them
with
her
wing
;
they
had
heard
the
voice
of
authority
;
the
spirit
of
religion
was
abroad
with
her
eyes
bandaged
tight
and
her
lips
gaping
wide
.
But
nobody
knew
whose
face
had
been
seen
.
Was
it
the
Prince
of
Wales
's
,
the
Queen
's
,
the
Prime
Minister
's
?
Whose
face
was
it
?
Nobody
knew
.
Edgar
J.
Watkiss
,
with
his
roll
of
lead
piping
round
his
arm
,
said
audibly
,
humorously
of
course
:
``
The
Proime
Minister
's
kyar
.
''
Septimus
Warren
Smith
,
who
found
himself
unable
to
pass
,
heard
him
.
Septimus
Warren
Smith
,
aged
about
thirty
,
pale-faced
,
beak-nosed
,
wearing
brown
shoes
and
a
shabby
overcoat
,
with
hazel
eyes
which
had
that
look
of
apprehension
in
them
which
makes
complete
strangers
apprehensive
too
.
The
world
has
raised
its
whip
;
where
will
it
descend
?
Everything
had
come
to
a
standstill
.
The
throb
of
the
motor
engines
sounded
like
a
pulse
irregularly
drumming
through
an
entire
body
.
The
sun
became
extraordinarily
hot
because
the
motor
car
had
stopped
outside
Mulberry
's
shop
window
;
old
ladies
on
the
tops
of
omnibuses
spread
their
black
parasols
;
here
a
green
,
here
a
red
parasol
opened
with
a
little
pop
.
Mrs.
Dalloway
,
coming
to
the
window
with
her
arms
full
of
sweet
peas
,
looked
out
with
her
little
pink
face
pursed
in
enquiry
.
Every
one
looked
at
the
motor
car
.
Septimus
looked
.
Boys
on
bicycles
sprang
off
.
Traffic
accumulated
.
And
there
the
motor
car
stood
,
with
drawn
blinds
,
and
upon
them
a
curious
pattern
like
a
tree
,
Septimus
thought
,
and
this
gradual
drawing
together
of
everything
to
one
centre
before
his
eyes
,
as
if
some
horror
had
come
almost
to
the
surface
and
was
about
to
burst
into
flames
,
terrified
him
.
The
world
wavered
and
quivered
and
threatened
to
burst
into
flames
.
It
is
I
who
am
blocking
the
way
,
he
thought
.
Was
he
not
being
looked
at
and
pointed
at
;
was
he
not
weighted
there
,
rooted
to
the
pavement
,
for
a
purpose
?
But
for
what
purpose
?
``
Let
us
go
on
,
Septimus
,
''
said
his
wife
,
a
little
woman
,
with
large
eyes
in
a
sallow
pointed
face
;
an
Italian
girl
.
But
Lucrezia
herself
could
not
help
looking
at
the
motor
car
and
the
tree
pattern
on
the
blinds
.
Was
it
the
Queen
in
there
--
the
Queen
going
shopping
?
The
chauffeur
,
who
had
been
opening
something
,
turning
something
,
shutting
something
,
got
on
to
the
box
.
``
Come
on
,
''
said
Lucrezia
.
But
her
husband
,
for
they
had
been
married
four
,
five
years
now
,
jumped
,
started
,
and
said
,
``
All
right
!
''
angrily
,
as
if
she
had
interrupted
him
.
People
must
notice
;
people
must
see
.
People
,
she
thought
,
looking
at
the
crowd
staring
at
the
motor
car
;
the
English
people
,
with
their
children
and
their
horses
and
their
clothes
,
which
she
admired
in
a
way
;
but
they
were
``
people
''
now
,
because
Septimus
had
said
,
``
I
will
kill
myself
''
;
an
awful
thing
to
say
.
Suppose
they
had
heard
him
?
She
looked
at
the
crowd
.
Help
,
help
!
she
wanted
to
cry
out
to
butchers
'
boys
and
women
.
Help
!
Only
last
autumn
she
and
Septimus
had
stood
on
the
Embankment
wrapped
in
the
same
cloak
and
,
Septimus
reading
a
paper
instead
of
talking
,
she
had
snatched
it
from
him
and
laughed
in
the
old
man
's
face
who
saw
them
!
But
failure
one
conceals
.
She
must
take
him
away
into
some
park
.
``
Now
we
will
cross
,
''
she
said
.
She
had
a
right
to
his
arm
,
though
it
was
without
feeling
.
He
would
give
her
,
who
was
so
simple
,
so
impulsive
,
only
twenty-four
,
without
friends
in
England
,
who
had
left
Italy
for
his
sake
,
a
piece
of
bone
.
The
motor
car
with
its
blinds
drawn
and
an
air
of
inscrutable
reserve
proceeded
towards
Piccadilly
,
still
gazed
at
,
still
ruffling
the
faces
on
both
sides
of
the
street
with
the
same
dark
breath
of
veneration
whether
for
Queen
,
Prince
,
or
Prime
Minister
nobody
knew
.
The
face
itself
had
been
seen
only
once
by
three
people
for
a
few
seconds
.
Even
the
sex
was
now
in
dispute
.
But
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
greatness
was
seated
within
;
greatness
was
passing
,
hidden
,
down
Bond
Street
,
removed
only
by
a
hand's-breadth
from
ordinary
people
who
might
now
,
for
the
first
and
last
time
,
be
within
speaking
distance
of
the
majesty
of
England
,
of
the
enduring
symbol
of
the
state
which
will
be
known
to
curious
antiquaries
,
sifting
the
ruins
of
time
,
when
London
is
a
grass-grown
path
and
all
those
hurrying
along
the
pavement
this
Wednesday
morning
are
but
bones
with
a
few
wedding
rings
mixed
up
in
their
dust
and
the
gold
stoppings
of
innumerable
decayed
teeth
.
The
face
in
the
motor
car
will
then
be
known
.
It
is
probably
the
Queen
,
thought
Mrs.
Dalloway
,
coming
out
of
Mulberry
's
with
her
flowers
;
the
Queen
.
And
for
a
second
she
wore
a
look
of
extreme
dignity
standing
by
the
flower
shop
in
the
sunlight
while
the
car
passed
at
a
foot
's
pace
,
with
its
blinds
drawn
.
The
Queen
going
to
some
hospital
;
the
Queen
opening
some
bazaar
,
thought
Clarissa
.
The
crush
was
terrific
for
the
time
of
day
.
Lords
,
Ascot
,
Hurlingham
,
what
was
it
?
she
wondered
,
for
the
street
was
blocked
.
The
British
middle
classes
sitting
sideways
on
the
tops
of
omnibuses
with
parcels
and
umbrellas
,
yes
,
even
furs
on
a
day
like
this
,
were
,
she
thought
,
more
ridiculous
,
more
unlike
anything
there
has
ever
been
than
one
could
conceive
;
and
the
Queen
herself
held
up
;
the
Queen
herself
unable
to
pass
.
Clarissa
was
suspended
on
one
side
of
Brook
Street
;
Sir
John
Buckhurst
,
the
old
Judge
on
the
other
,
with
the
car
between
them
(
Sir
John
had
laid
down
the
law
for
years
and
liked
a
well-dressed
woman
)
when
the
chauffeur
,
leaning
ever
so
slightly
,
said
or
showed
something
to
the
policeman
,
who
saluted
and
raised
his
arm
and
jerked
his
head
and
moved
the
omnibus
to
the
side
and
the
car
passed
through
.
Slowly
and
very
silently
it
took
its
way
.
Clarissa
guessed
;
Clarissa
knew
of
course
;
she
had
seen
something
white
,
magical
,
circular
,
in
the
footman
's
hand
,
a
disc
inscribed
with
a
name
,
--
the
Queen
's
,
the
Prince
of
Wales
's
,
the
Prime
Minister
's
?
--
which
,
by
force
of
its
own
lustre
,
burnt
its
way
through
(
Clarissa
saw
the
car
diminishing
,
disappearing
)
,
to
blaze
among
candelabras
,
glittering
stars
,
breasts
stiff
with
oak
leaves
,
Hugh
Whitbread
and
all
his
colleagues
,
the
gentlemen
of
England
,
that
night
in
Buckingham
Palace
.
And
Clarissa
,
too
,
gave
a
party
.
She
stiffened
a
little
;
so
she
would
stand
at
the
top
of
her
stairs
.
The
car
had
gone
,
but
it
had
left
a
slight
ripple
which
flowed
through
glove
shops
and
hat
shops
and
tailors
'
shops
on
both
sides
of
Bond
Street
.
For
thirty
seconds
all
heads
were
inclined
the
same
way
--
to
the
window
.
Choosing
a
pair
of
gloves
--
should
they
be
to
the
elbow
or
above
it
,
lemon
or
pale
grey
?
--
ladies
stopped
;
when
the
sentence
was
finished
something
had
happened
.
Something
so
trifling
in
single
instances
that
no
mathematical
instrument
,
though
capable
of
transmitting
shocks
in
China
,
could
register
the
vibration
;
yet
in
its
fulness
rather
formidable
and
in
its
common
appeal
emotional
;
for
in
all
the
hat
shops
and
tailors
'
shops
strangers
looked
at
each
other
and
thought
of
the
dead
;
of
the
flag
;
of
Empire
.
In
a
public
house
in
a
back
street
a
Colonial
insulted
the
House
of
Windsor
which
led
to
words
,
broken
beer
glasses
,
and
a
general
shindy
,
which
echoed
strangely
across
the
way
in
the
ears
of
girls
buying
white
underlinen
threaded
with
pure
white
ribbon
for
their
weddings
.
For
the
surface
agitation
of
the
passing
car
as
it
sunk
grazed
something
very
profound
.
Gliding
across
Piccadilly
,
the
car
turned
down
St.
James
's
Street
.
Tall
men
,
men
of
robust
physique
,
well-dressed
men
with
their
tail-coats
and
their
white
slips
and
their
hair
raked
back
who
,
for
reasons
difficult
to
discriminate
,
were
standing
in
the
bow
window
of
Brooks
's
with
their
hands
behind
the
tails
of
their
coats
,
looking
out
,
perceived
instinctively
that
greatness
was
passing
,
and
the
pale
light
of
the
immortal
presence
fell
upon
them
as
it
had
fallen
upon
Clarissa
Dalloway
.
At
once
they
stood
even
straighter
,
and
removed
their
hands
,
and
seemed
ready
to
attend
their
Sovereign
,
if
need
be
,
to
the
cannon
's
mouth
,
as
their
ancestors
had
done
before
them
.
The
white
busts
and
the
little
tables
in
the
background
covered
with
copies
of
the
Tatler
and
syphons
of
soda
water
seemed
to
approve
;
seemed
to
indicate
the
flowing
corn
and
the
manor
houses
of
England
;
and
to
return
the
frail
hum
of
the
motor
wheels
as
the
walls
of
a
whispering
gallery
return
a
single
voice
expanded
and
made
sonorous
by
the
might
of
a
whole
cathedral
.
Shawled
Moll
Pratt
with
her
flowers
on
the
pavement
wished
the
dear
boy
well
(
it
was
the
Prince
of
Wales
for
certain
)
and
would
have
tossed
the
price
of
a
pot
of
beer
--
a
bunch
of
roses
--
into
St.
James
's
Street
out
of
sheer
light-heartedness
and
contempt
of
poverty
had
she
not
seen
the
constable
's
eye
upon
her
,
discouraging
an
old
Irishwoman
's
loyalty
.
The
sentries
at
St.
James
's
saluted
;
Queen
Alexandra
's
policeman
approved
.
A
small
crowd
meanwhile
had
gathered
at
the
gates
of
Buckingham
Palace
.
Listlessly
,
yet
confidently
,
poor
people
all
of
them
,
they
waited
;
looked
at
the
Palace
itself
with
the
flag
flying
;
at
Victoria
,
billowing
on
her
mound
,
admired
her
shelves
of
running
water
,
her
geraniums
;
singled
out
from
the
motor
cars
in
the
Mall
first
this
one
,
then
that
;
bestowed
emotion
,
vainly
,
upon
commoners
out
for
a
drive
;
recalled
their
tribute
to
keep
it
unspent
while
this
car
passed
and
that
;
and
all
the
time
let
rumour
accumulate
in
their
veins
and
thrill
the
nerves
in
their
thighs
at
the
thought
of
Royalty
looking
at
them
;
the
Queen
bowing
;
the
Prince
saluting
;
at
the
thought
of
the
heavenly
life
divinely
bestowed
upon
Kings
;
of
the
equerries
and
deep
curtsies
;
of
the
Queen
's
old
doll
's
house
;
of
Princess
Mary
married
to
an
Englishman
,
and
the
Prince
--
ah
!
the
Prince
!
who
took
wonderfully
,
they
said
,
after
old
King
Edward
,
but
was
ever
so
much
slimmer
.
The
Prince
lived
at
St.
James
's
;
but
he
might
come
along
in
the
morning
to
visit
his
mother
.
So
Sarah
Bletchley
said
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
,
tipping
her
foot
up
and
down
as
though
she
were
by
her
own
fender
in
Pimlico
,
but
keeping
her
eyes
on
the
Mall
,
while
Emily
Coates
ranged
over
the
Palace
windows
and
thought
of
the
housemaids
,
the
innumerable
housemaids
,
the
bedrooms
,
the
innumerable
bedrooms
.
Joined
by
an
elderly
gentleman
with
an
Aberdeen
terrier
,
by
men
without
occupation
,
the
crowd
increased
.
Little
Mr.
Bowley
,
who
had
rooms
in
the
Albany
and
was
sealed
with
wax
over
the
deeper
sources
of
life
but
could
be
unsealed
suddenly
,
inappropriately
,
sentimentally
,
by
this
sort
of
thing
--
poor
women
waiting
to
see
the
Queen
go
past
--
poor
women
,
nice
little
children
,
orphans
,
widows
,
the
War
--
tut-tut
--
actually
had
tears
in
his
eyes
.
A
breeze
flaunting
ever
so
warmly
down
the
Mall
through
the
thin
trees
,
past
the
bronze
heroes
,
lifted
some
flag
flying
in
the
British
breast
of
Mr.
Bowley
and
he
raised
his
hat
as
the
car
turned
into
the
Mall
and
held
it
high
as
the
car
approached
;
and
let
the
poor
mothers
of
Pimlico
press
close
to
him
,
and
stood
very
upright
.
The
car
came
on
.
Suddenly
Mrs.
Coates
looked
up
into
the
sky
.
The
sound
of
an
aeroplane
bored
ominously
into
the
ears
of
the
crowd
.
There
it
was
coming
over
the
trees
,
letting
out
white
smoke
from
behind
,
which
curled
and
twisted
,
actually
writing
something
!
making
letters
in
the
sky
!
Every
one
looked
up
.
Dropping
dead
down
the
aeroplane
soared
straight
up
,
curved
in
a
loop
,
raced
,
sank
,
rose
,
and
whatever
it
did
,
wherever
it
went
,
out
fluttered
behind
it
a
thick
ruffled
bar
of
white
smoke
which
curled
and
wreathed
upon
the
sky
in
letters
.
But
what
letters
?
A
C
was
it
?
an
E
,
then
an
L
?
Only
for
a
moment
did
they
lie
still
;
then
they
moved
and
melted
and
were
rubbed
out
up
in
the
sky
,
and
the
aeroplane
shot
further
away
and
again
,
in
a
fresh
space
of
sky
,
began
writing
a
K
,
an
E
,
a
Y
perhaps
?
``
Glaxo
,
''
said
Mrs.
Coates
in
a
strained
,
awe-stricken
voice
,
gazing
straight
up
,
and
her
baby
,
lying
stiff
and
white
in
her
arms
,
gazed
straight
up
.
``
Kreemo
,
''
murmured
Mrs.
Bletchley
,
like
a
sleep-walker
.
With
his
hat
held
out
perfectly
still
in
his
hand
,
Mr.
Bowley
gazed
straight
up
.
All
down
the
Mall
people
were
standing
and
looking
up
into
the
sky
.
As
they
looked
the
whole
world
became
perfectly
silent
,
and
a
flight
of
gulls
crossed
the
sky
,
first
one
gull
leading
,
then
another
,
and
in
this
extraordinary
silence
and
peace
,
in
this
pallor
,
in
this
purity
,
bells
struck
eleven
times
,
the
sound
fading
up
there
among
the
gulls
.
The
aeroplane
turned
and
raced
and
swooped
exactly
where
it
liked
,
swiftly
,
freely
,
like
a
skater
--
``
That
's
an
E
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bletchley
--
or
a
dancer
--
``
It
's
toffee
,
''
murmured
Mr.
Bowley
--
(
and
the
car
went
in
at
the
gates
and
nobody
looked
at
it
)
,
and
shutting
off
the
smoke
,
away
and
away
it
rushed
,
and
the
smoke
faded
and
assembled
itself
round
the
broad
white
shapes
of
the
clouds
.
It
had
gone
;
it
was
behind
the
clouds
.
There
was
no
sound
.
The
clouds
to
which
the
letters
E
,
G
,
or
L
had
attached
themselves
moved
freely
,
as
if
destined
to
cross
from
West
to
East
on
a
mission
of
the
greatest
importance
which
would
never
be
revealed
,
and
yet
certainly
so
it
was
--
a
mission
of
the
greatest
importance
.
Then
suddenly
,
as
a
train
comes
out
of
a
tunnel
,
the
aeroplane
rushed
out
of
the
clouds
again
,
the
sound
boring
into
the
ears
of
all
people
in
the
Mall
,
in
the
Green
Park
,
in
Piccadilly
,
in
Regent
Street
,
in
Regent
's
Park
,
and
the
bar
of
smoke
curved
behind
and
it
dropped
down
,
and
it
soared
up
and
wrote
one
letter
after
another
--
but
what
word
was
it
writing
?
Lucrezia
Warren
Smith
,
sitting
by
her
husband
's
side
on
a
seat
in
Regent
's
Park
in
the
Broad
Walk
,
looked
up
.
``
Look
,
look
,
Septimus
!
''
she
cried
.
For
Dr.
Holmes
had
told
her
to
make
her
husband
(
who
had
nothing
whatever
seriously
the
matter
with
him
but
was
a
little
out
of
sorts
)
take
an
interest
in
things
outside
himself
.
So
,
thought
Septimus
,
looking
up
,
they
are
signalling
to
me
.
Not
indeed
in
actual
words
;
that
is
,
he
could
not
read
the
language
yet
;
but
it
was
plain
enough
,
this
beauty
,
this
exquisite
beauty
,
and
tears
filled
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
the
smoke
words
languishing
and
melting
in
the
sky
and
bestowing
upon
him
in
their
inexhaustible
charity
and
laughing
goodness
one
shape
after
another
of
unimaginable
beauty
and
signalling
their
intention
to
provide
him
,
for
nothing
,
for
ever
,
for
looking
merely
,
with
beauty
,
more
beauty
!
Tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
.
It
was
toffee
;
they
were
advertising
toffee
,
a
nursemaid
told
Rezia
.
Together
they
began
to
spell
t
.
.
.
o
.
.
.
f
.
.
.
``
K
.
.
.
R
.
.
.
''
said
the
nursemaid
,
and
Septimus
heard
her
say
``
Kay
Arr
''
close
to
his
ear
,
deeply
,
softly
,
like
a
mellow
organ
,
but
with
a
roughness
in
her
voice
like
a
grasshopper
's
,
which
rasped
his
spine
deliciously
and
sent
running
up
into
his
brain
waves
of
sound
which
,
concussing
,
broke
.
A
marvellous
discovery
indeed
--
that
the
human
voice
in
certain
atmospheric
conditions
(
for
one
must
be
scientific
,
above
all
scientific
)
can
quicken
trees
into
life
!
Happily
Rezia
put
her
hand
with
a
tremendous
weight
on
his
knee
so
that
he
was
weighted
down
,
transfixed
,
or
the
excitement
of
the
elm
trees
rising
and
falling
,
rising
and
falling
with
all
their
leaves
alight
and
the
colour
thinning
and
thickening
from
blue
to
the
green
of
a
hollow
wave
,
like
plumes
on
horses
'
heads
,
feathers
on
ladies
'
,
so
proudly
they
rose
and
fell
,
so
superbly
,
would
have
sent
him
mad
.
But
he
would
not
go
mad
.
He
would
shut
his
eyes
;
he
would
see
no
more
.
But
they
beckoned
;
leaves
were
alive
;
trees
were
alive
.
And
the
leaves
being
connected
by
millions
of
fibres
with
his
own
body
,
there
on
the
seat
,
fanned
it
up
and
down
;
when
the
branch
stretched
he
,
too
,
made
that
statement
.
The
sparrows
fluttering
,
rising
,
and
falling
in
jagged
fountains
were
part
of
the
pattern
;
the
white
and
blue
,
barred
with
black
branches
.
Sounds
made
harmonies
with
premeditation
;
the
spaces
between
them
were
as
significant
as
the
sounds
.
A
child
cried
.
Rightly
far
away
a
horn
sounded
.
All
taken
together
meant
the
birth
of
a
new
religion
--
``
Septimus
!
''
said
Rezia
.
He
started
violently
.
People
must
notice
.
``
I
am
going
to
walk
to
the
fountain
and
back
,
''
she
said
.
For
she
could
stand
it
no
longer
.
Dr.
Holmes
might
say
there
was
nothing
the
matter
.
Far
rather
would
she
that
he
were
dead
!
She
could
not
sit
beside
him
when
he
stared
so
and
did
not
see
her
and
made
everything
terrible
;
sky
and
tree
,
children
playing
,
dragging
carts
,
blowing
whistles
,
falling
down
;
all
were
terrible
.
And
he
would
not
kill
himself
;
and
she
could
tell
no
one
.
``
Septimus
has
been
working
too
hard
''
--
that
was
all
she
could
say
to
her
own
mother
.
To
love
makes
one
solitary
,
she
thought
.
She
could
tell
nobody
,
not
even
Septimus
now
,
and
looking
back
,
she
saw
him
sitting
in
his
shabby
overcoat
alone
,
on
the
seat
,
hunched
up
,
staring
.
And
it
was
cowardly
for
a
man
to
say
he
would
kill
himself
,
but
Septimus
had
fought
;
he
was
brave
;
he
was
not
Septimus
now
.
She
put
on
her
lace
collar
.
She
put
on
her
new
hat
and
he
never
noticed
;
and
he
was
happy
without
her
.
Nothing
could
make
her
happy
without
him
!
Nothing
!
He
was
selfish
.
So
men
are
.
For
he
was
not
ill.
Dr.
Holmes
said
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
him
.
She
spread
her
hand
before
her
.
Look
!
Her
wedding
ring
slipped
--
she
had
grown
so
thin
.
It
was
she
who
suffered
--
but
she
had
nobody
to
tell
.
Far
was
Italy
and
the
white
houses
and
the
room
where
her
sisters
sat
making
hats
,
and
the
streets
crowded
every
evening
with
people
walking
,
laughing
out
loud
,
not
half
alive
like
people
here
,
huddled
up
in
Bath
chairs
,
looking
at
a
few
ugly
flowers
stuck
in
pots
!
``
For
you
should
see
the
Milan
gardens
,
''
she
said
aloud
.
But
to
whom
?
There
was
nobody
.
Her
words
faded
.
So
a
rocket
fades
.
Its
sparks
,
having
grazed
their
way
into
the
night
,
surrender
to
it
,
dark
descends
,
pours
over
the
outlines
of
houses
and
towers
;
bleak
hillsides
soften
and
fall
in
.
But
though
they
are
gone
,
the
night
is
full
of
them
;
robbed
of
colour
,
blank
of
windows
,
they
exist
more
ponderously
,
give
out
what
the
frank
daylight
fails
to
transmit
--
the
trouble
and
suspense
of
things
conglomerated
there
in
the
darkness
;
huddled
together
in
the
darkness
;
reft
of
the
relief
which
dawn
brings
when
,
washing
the
walls
white
and
grey
,
spotting
each
window-pane
,
lifting
the
mist
from
the
fields
,
showing
the
red-brown
cows
peacefully
grazing
,
all
is
once
more
decked
out
to
the
eye
;
exists
again
.
I
am
alone
;
I
am
alone
!
she
cried
,
by
the
fountain
in
Regent
's
Park
(
staring
at
the
Indian
and
his
cross
)
,
as
perhaps
at
midnight
,
when
all
boundaries
are
lost
,
the
country
reverts
to
its
ancient
shape
,
as
the
Romans
saw
it
,
lying
cloudy
,
when
they
landed
,
and
the
hills
had
no
names
and
rivers
wound
they
knew
not
where
--
such
was
her
darkness
;
when
suddenly
,
as
if
a
shelf
were
shot
forth
and
she
stood
on
it
,
she
said
how
she
was
his
wife
,
married
years
ago
in
Milan
,
his
wife
,
and
would
never
,
never
tell
that
he
was
mad
!
Turning
,
the
shelf
fell
;
down
,
down
she
dropped
.
For
he
was
gone
,
she
thought
--
gone
,
as
he
threatened
,
to
kill
himself
--
to
throw
himself
under
a
cart
!
But
no
;
there
he
was
;
still
sitting
alone
on
the
seat
,
in
his
shabby
overcoat
,
his
legs
crossed
,
staring
,
talking
aloud
.
Men
must
not
cut
down
trees
.
There
is
a
God
.
(
He
noted
such
revelations
on
the
backs
of
envelopes
.
)
Change
the
world
.
No
one
kills
from
hatred
.
Make
it
known
(
he
wrote
it
down
)
.
He
waited
.
He
listened
.
A
sparrow
perched
on
the
railing
opposite
chirped
Septimus
,
Septimus
,
four
or
five
times
over
and
went
on
,
drawing
its
notes
out
,
to
sing
freshly
and
piercingly
in
Greek
words
how
there
is
no
crime
and
,
joined
by
another
sparrow
,
they
sang
in
voices
prolonged
and
piercing
in
Greek
words
,
from
trees
in
the
meadow
of
life
beyond
a
river
where
the
dead
walk
,
how
there
is
no
death
.
There
was
his
hand
;
there
the
dead
.
White
things
were
assembling
behind
the
railings
opposite
.
But
he
dared
not
look
.
Evans
was
behind
the
railings
!
``
What
are
you
saying
?
''
said
Rezia
suddenly
,
sitting
down
by
him
.
Interrupted
again
!
She
was
always
interrupting
.
Away
from
people
--
they
must
get
away
from
people
,
he
said
(
jumping
up
)
,
right
away
over
there
,
where
there
were
chairs
beneath
a
tree
and
the
long
slope
of
the
park
dipped
like
a
length
of
green
stuff
with
a
ceiling
cloth
of
blue
and
pink
smoke
high
above
,
and
there
was
a
rampart
of
far
irregular
houses
hazed
in
smoke
,
the
traffic
hummed
in
a
circle
,
and
on
the
right
,
dun-coloured
animals
stretched
long
necks
over
the
Zoo
palings
,
barking
,
howling
.
There
they
sat
down
under
a
tree
.
``
Look
,
''
she
implored
him
,
pointing
at
a
little
troop
of
boys
carrying
cricket
stumps
,
and
one
shuffled
,
spun
round
on
his
heel
and
shuffled
,
as
if
he
were
acting
a
clown
at
the
music
hall
.
``
Look
,
''
she
implored
him
,
for
Dr.
Holmes
had
told
her
to
make
him
notice
real
things
,
go
to
a
music
hall
,
play
cricket
--
that
was
the
very
game
,
Dr.
Holmes
said
,
a
nice
out-of-door
game
,
the
very
game
for
her
husband
.
``
Look
,
''
she
repeated
.
Look
the
unseen
bade
him
,
the
voice
which
now
communicated
with
him
who
was
the
greatest
of
mankind
,
Septimus
,
lately
taken
from
life
to
death
,
the
Lord
who
had
come
to
renew
society
,
who
lay
like
a
coverlet
,
a
snow
blanket
smitten
only
by
the
sun
,
for
ever
unwasted
,
suffering
for
ever
,
the
scapegoat
,
the
eternal
sufferer
,
but
he
did
not
want
it
,
he
moaned
,
putting
from
him
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
that
eternal
suffering
,
that
eternal
loneliness
.
``
Look
,
''
she
repeated
,
for
he
must
not
talk
aloud
to
himself
out
of
doors
.
``
Oh
look
,
''
she
implored
him
.
But
what
was
there
to
look
at
?
A
few
sheep
.
That
was
all
.
The
way
to
Regent
's
Park
Tube
station
--
could
they
tell
her
the
way
to
Regent
's
Park
Tube
station
--
Maisie
Johnson
wanted
to
know
.
She
was
only
up
from
Edinburgh
two
days
ago
.
``
Not
this
way
--
over
there
!
''
Rezia
exclaimed
,
waving
her
aside
,
lest
she
should
see
Septimus
.
Both
seemed
queer
,
Maisie
Johnson
thought
.
Everything
seemed
very
queer
.
In
London
for
the
first
time
,
come
to
take
up
a
post
at
her
uncle
's
in
Leadenhall
Street
,
and
now
walking
through
Regent
's
Park
in
the
morning
,
this
couple
on
the
chairs
gave
her
quite
a
turn
;
the
young
woman
seeming
foreign
,
the
man
looking
queer
;
so
that
should
she
be
very
old
she
would
still
remember
and
make
it
jangle
again
among
her
memories
how
she
had
walked
through
Regent
's
Park
on
a
fine
summer
's
morning
fifty
years
ago
.
For
she
was
only
nineteen
and
had
got
her
way
at
last
,
to
come
to
London
;
and
now
how
queer
it
was
,
this
couple
she
had
asked
the
way
of
,
and
the
girl
started
and
jerked
her
hand
,
and
the
man
--
he
seemed
awfully
odd
;
quarrelling
,
perhaps
;
parting
for
ever
,
perhaps
;
something
was
up
,
she
knew
;
and
now
all
these
people
(
for
she
returned
to
the
Broad
Walk
)
,
the
stone
basins
,
the
prim
flowers
,
the
old
men
and
women
,
invalids
most
of
them
in
Bath
chairs
--
all
seemed
,
after
Edinburgh
,
so
queer
.
And
Maisie
Johnson
,
as
she
joined
that
gently
trudging
,
vaguely
gazing
,
breeze-kissed
company
--
squirrels
perching
and
preening
,
sparrow
fountains
fluttering
for
crumbs
,
dogs
busy
with
the
railings
,
busy
with
each
other
,
while
the
soft
warm
air
washed
over
them
and
lent
to
the
fixed
unsurprised
gaze
with
which
they
received
life
something
whimsical
and
mollified
--
Maisie
Johnson
positively
felt
she
must
cry
Oh
!
(
for
that
young
man
on
the
seat
had
given
her
quite
a
turn
.
Something
was
up
,
she
knew
.
)
Horror
!
horror
!
she
wanted
to
cry
.
(
She
had
left
her
people
;
they
had
warned
her
what
would
happen
.
)
Why
had
n't
she
stayed
at
home
?
she
cried
,
twisting
the
knob
of
the
iron
railing
.
That
girl
,
thought
Mrs.
Dempster
(
who
saved
crusts
for
the
squirrels
and
often
ate
her
lunch
in
Regent
's
Park
)
,
do
n't
know
a
thing
yet
;
and
really
it
seemed
to
her
better
to
be
a
little
stout
,
a
little
slack
,
a
little
moderate
in
one
's
expectations
.
Percy
drank
.
Well
,
better
to
have
a
son
,
thought
Mrs.
Dempster
.
She
had
had
a
hard
time
of
it
,
and
could
n't
help
smiling
at
a
girl
like
that
.
You
'll
get
married
,
for
you
're
pretty
enough
,
thought
Mrs.
Dempster
.
Get
married
,
she
thought
,
and
then
you
'll
know
.
Oh
,
the
cooks
,
and
so
on
.
Every
man
has
his
ways
.
But
whether
I
'd
have
chosen
quite
like
that
if
I
could
have
known
,
thought
Mrs.
Dempster
,
and
could
not
help
wishing
to
whisper
a
word
to
Maisie
Johnson
;
to
feel
on
the
creased
pouch
of
her
worn
old
face
the
kiss
of
pity
.
For
it
's
been
a
hard
life
,
thought
Mrs.
Dempster
.
What
had
n't
she
given
to
it
?
Roses
;
figure
;
her
feet
too
.
(
She
drew
the
knobbed
lumps
beneath
her
skirt
.
)
Roses
,
she
thought
sardonically
.
All
trash
,
m'dear
.
For
really
,
what
with
eating
,
drinking
,
and
mating
,
the
bad
days
and
good
,
life
had
been
no
mere
matter
of
roses
,
and
what
was
more
,
let
me
tell
you
,
Carrie
Dempster
had
no
wish
to
change
her
lot
with
any
woman
's
in
Kentish
Town
!
But
,
she
implored
,
pity
.
Pity
,
for
the
loss
of
roses
.
Pity
she
asked
of
Maisie
Johnson
,
standing
by
the
hyacinth
beds
.
Ah
,
but
that
aeroplane
!
Had
n't
Mrs.
Dempster
always
longed
to
see
foreign
parts
?
She
had
a
nephew
,
a
missionary
.
It
soared
and
shot
.
She
always
went
on
the
sea
at
Margate
,
not
out
o
'
sight
of
land
,
but
she
had
no
patience
with
women
who
were
afraid
of
water
.
It
swept
and
fell
.
Her
stomach
was
in
her
mouth
.
Up
again
.
There
's
a
fine
young
feller
aboard
of
it
,
Mrs.
Dempster
wagered
,
and
away
and
away
it
went
,
fast
and
fading
,
away
and
away
the
aeroplane
shot
;
soaring
over
Greenwich
and
all
the
masts
;
over
the
little
island
of
grey
churches
,
St.
Paul
's
and
the
rest
till
,
on
either
side
of
London
,
fields
spread
out
and
dark
brown
woods
where
adventurous
thrushes
hopping
boldly
,
glancing
quickly
,
snatched
the
snail
and
tapped
him
on
a
stone
,
once
,
twice
,
thrice
.
Away
and
away
the
aeroplane
shot
,
till
it
was
nothing
but
a
bright
spark
;
an
aspiration
;
a
concentration
;
a
symbol
(
so
it
seemed
to
Mr.
Bentley
,
vigorously
rolling
his
strip
of
turf
at
Greenwich
)
of
man
's
soul
;
of
his
determination
,
thought
Mr.
Bentley
,
sweeping
round
the
cedar
tree
,
to
get
outside
his
body
,
beyond
his
house
,
by
means
of
thought
,
Einstein
,
speculation
,
mathematics
,
the
Mendelian
theory
--
away
the
aeroplane
shot
.
Then
,
while
a
seedy-looking
nondescript
man
carrying
a
leather
bag
stood
on
the
steps
of
St.
Paul
's
Cathedral
,
and
hesitated
,
for
within
was
what
balm
,
how
great
a
welcome
,
how
many
tombs
with
banners
waving
over
them
,
tokens
of
victories
not
over
armies
,
but
over
,
he
thought
,
that
plaguy
spirit
of
truth
seeking
which
leaves
me
at
present
without
a
situation
,
and
more
than
that
,
the
cathedral
offers
company
,
he
thought
,
invites
you
to
membership
of
a
society
;
great
men
belong
to
it
;
martyrs
have
died
for
it
;
why
not
enter
in
,
he
thought
,
put
this
leather
bag
stuffed
with
pamphlets
before
an
altar
,
a
cross
,
the
symbol
of
something
which
has
soared
beyond
seeking
and
questing
and
knocking
of
words
together
and
has
become
all
spirit
,
disembodied
,
ghostly
--
why
not
enter
in
?
he
thought
and
while
he
hesitated
out
flew
the
aeroplane
over
Ludgate
Circus
.
It
was
strange
;
it
was
still
.
Not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
above
the
traffic
.
Unguided
it
seemed
;
sped
of
its
own
free
will
.
And
now
,
curving
up
and
up
,
straight
up
,
like
something
mounting
in
ecstasy
,
in
pure
delight
,
out
from
behind
poured
white
smoke
looping
,
writing
a
T
,
an
O
,
an
F.
``
What
are
they
looking
at
?
''
said
Clarissa
Dalloway
to
the
maid
who
opened
her
door
.
The
hall
of
the
house
was
cool
as
a
vault
.
Mrs.
Dalloway
raised
her
hand
to
her
eyes
,
and
,
as
the
maid
shut
the
door
to
,
and
she
heard
the
swish
of
Lucy
's
skirts
,
she
felt
like
a
nun
who
has
left
the
world
and
feels
fold
round
her
the
familiar
veils
and
the
response
to
old
devotions
.
The
cook
whistled
in
the
kitchen
.
She
heard
the
click
of
the
typewriter
.
It
was
her
life
,
and
,
bending
her
head
over
the
hall
table
,
she
bowed
beneath
the
influence
,
felt
blessed
and
purified
,
saying
to
herself
,
as
she
took
the
pad
with
the
telephone
message
on
it
,
how
moments
like
this
are
buds
on
the
tree
of
life
,
flowers
of
darkness
they
are
,
she
thought
(
as
if
some
lovely
rose
had
blossomed
for
her
eyes
only
)
;
not
for
a
moment
did
she
believe
in
God
;
but
all
the
more
,
she
thought
,
taking
up
the
pad
,
must
one
repay
in
daily
life
to
servants
,
yes
,
to
dogs
and
canaries
,
above
all
to
Richard
her
husband
,
who
was
the
foundation
of
it
--
of
the
gay
sounds
,
of
the
green
lights
,
of
the
cook
even
whistling
,
for
Mrs.
Walker
was
Irish
and
whistled
all
day
long
--
one
must
pay
back
from
this
secret
deposit
of
exquisite
moments
,
she
thought
,
lifting
the
pad
,
while
Lucy
stood
by
her
,
trying
to
explain
how
``
Mr.
Dalloway
,
ma'am
''
--
Clarissa
read
on
the
telephone
pad
,
``
Lady
Bruton
wishes
to
know
if
Mr.
Dalloway
will
lunch
with
her
to-day
.
''
``
Mr.
Dalloway
,
ma'am
,
told
me
to
tell
you
he
would
be
lunching
out
.
''
``
Dear
!
''
said
Clarissa
,
and
Lucy
shared
as
she
meant
her
to
her
disappointment
(
but
not
the
pang
)
;
felt
the
concord
between
them
;
took
the
hint
;
thought
how
the
gentry
love
;
gilded
her
own
future
with
calm
;
and
,
taking
Mrs.
Dalloway
's
parasol
,
handled
it
like
a
sacred
weapon
which
a
Goddess
,
having
acquitted
herself
honourably
in
the
field
of
battle
,
sheds
,
and
placed
it
in
the
umbrella
stand
.
``
Fear
no
more
,
''
said
Clarissa
.
Fear
no
more
the
heat
o
'
the
sun
;
for
the
shock
of
Lady
Bruton
asking
Richard
to
lunch
without
her
made
the
moment
in
which
she
had
stood
shiver
,
as
a
plant
on
the
river-bed
feels
the
shock
of
a
passing
oar
and
shivers
:
so
she
rocked
:
so
she
shivered
.
Millicent
Bruton
,
whose
lunch
parties
were
said
to
be
extraordinarily
amusing
,
had
not
asked
her
.
No
vulgar
jealousy
could
separate
her
from
Richard
.
But
she
feared
time
itself
,
and
read
on
Lady
Bruton
's
face
,
as
if
it
had
been
a
dial
cut
in
impassive
stone
,
the
dwindling
of
life
;
how
year
by
year
her
share
was
sliced
;
how
little
the
margin
that
remained
was
capable
any
longer
of
stretching
,
of
absorbing
,
as
in
the
youthful
years
,
the
colours
,
salts
,
tones
of
existence
,
so
that
she
filled
the
room
she
entered
,
and
felt
often
as
she
stood
hesitating
one
moment
on
the
threshold
of
her
drawing-room
,
an
exquisite
suspense
,
such
as
might
stay
a
diver
before
plunging
while
the
sea
darkens
and
brightens
beneath
him
,
and
the
waves
which
threaten
to
break
,
but
only
gently
split
their
surface
,
roll
and
conceal
and
encrust
as
they
just
turn
over
the
weeds
with
pearl
.
She
put
the
pad
on
the
hall
table
.
She
began
to
go
slowly
upstairs
,
with
her
hand
on
the
bannisters
,
as
if
she
had
left
a
party
,
where
now
this
friend
now
that
had
flashed
back
her
face
,
her
voice
;
had
shut
the
door
and
gone
out
and
stood
alone
,
a
single
figure
against
the
appalling
night
,
or
rather
,
to
be
accurate
,
against
the
stare
of
this
matter-of-fact
June
morning
;
soft
with
the
glow
of
rose
petals
for
some
,
she
knew
,
and
felt
it
,
as
she
paused
by
the
open
staircase
window
which
let
in
blinds
flapping
,
dogs
barking
,
let
in
,
she
thought
,
feeling
herself
suddenly
shrivelled
,
aged
,
breastless
,
the
grinding
,
blowing
,
flowering
of
the
day
,
out
of
doors
,
out
of
the
window
,
out
of
her
body
and
brain
which
now
failed
,
since
Lady
Bruton
,
whose
lunch
parties
were
said
to
be
extraordinarily
amusing
,
had
not
asked
her
.
Like
a
nun
withdrawing
,
or
a
child
exploring
a
tower
,
she
went
upstairs
,
paused
at
the
window
,
came
to
the
bathroom
.
There
was
the
green
linoleum
and
a
tap
dripping
.
There
was
an
emptiness
about
the
heart
of
life
;
an
attic
room
.
Women
must
put
off
their
rich
apparel
.
At
midday
they
must
disrobe
.
She
pierced
the
pincushion
and
laid
her
feathered
yellow
hat
on
the
bed
.
The
sheets
were
clean
,
tight
stretched
in
a
broad
white
band
from
side
to
side
.
Narrower
and
narrower
would
her
bed
be
.
The
candle
was
half
burnt
down
and
she
had
read
deep
in
Baron
Marbot
's
Memoirs
.
She
had
read
late
at
night
of
the
retreat
from
Moscow
.
For
the
House
sat
so
long
that
Richard
insisted
,
after
her
illness
,
that
she
must
sleep
undisturbed
.
And
really
she
preferred
to
read
of
the
retreat
from
Moscow
.
He
knew
it
.
So
the
room
was
an
attic
;
the
bed
narrow
;
and
lying
there
reading
,
for
she
slept
badly
,
she
could
not
dispel
a
virginity
preserved
through
childbirth
which
clung
to
her
like
a
sheet
.
Lovely
in
girlhood
,
suddenly
there
came
a
moment
--
for
example
on
the
river
beneath
the
woods
at
Clieveden
--
when
,
through
some
contraction
of
this
cold
spirit
,
she
had
failed
him
.
And
then
at
Constantinople
,
and
again
and
again
.
She
could
see
what
she
lacked
.
It
was
not
beauty
;
it
was
not
mind
.
It
was
something
central
which
permeated
;
something
warm
which
broke
up
surfaces
and
rippled
the
cold
contact
of
man
and
woman
,
or
of
women
together
.
For
that
she
could
dimly
perceive
.
She
resented
it
,
had
a
scruple
picked
up
Heaven
knows
where
,
or
,
as
she
felt
,
sent
by
Nature
(
who
is
invariably
wise
)
;
yet
she
could
not
resist
sometimes
yielding
to
the
charm
of
a
woman
,
not
a
girl
,
of
a
woman
confessing
,
as
to
her
they
often
did
,
some
scrape
,
some
folly
.
And
whether
it
was
pity
,
or
their
beauty
,
or
that
she
was
older
,
or
some
accident
--
like
a
faint
scent
,
or
a
violin
next
door
(
so
strange
is
the
power
of
sounds
at
certain
moments
)
,
she
did
undoubtedly
then
feel
what
men
felt
.
Only
for
a
moment
;
but
it
was
enough
.
It
was
a
sudden
revelation
,
a
tinge
like
a
blush
which
one
tried
to
check
and
then
,
as
it
spread
,
one
yielded
to
its
expansion
,
and
rushed
to
the
farthest
verge
and
there
quivered
and
felt
the
world
come
closer
,
swollen
with
some
astonishing
significance
,
some
pressure
of
rapture
,
which
split
its
thin
skin
and
gushed
and
poured
with
an
extraordinary
alleviation
over
the
cracks
and
sores
!
Then
,
for
that
moment
,
she
had
seen
an
illumination
;
a
match
burning
in
a
crocus
;
an
inner
meaning
almost
expressed
.
But
the
close
withdrew
;
the
hard
softened
.
It
was
over
--
the
moment
.
Against
such
moments
(
with
women
too
)
there
contrasted
(
as
she
laid
her
hat
down
)
the
bed
and
Baron
Marbot
and
the
candle
half-burnt
.
Lying
awake
,
the
floor
creaked
;
the
lit
house
was
suddenly
darkened
,
and
if
she
raised
her
head
she
could
just
hear
the
click
of
the
handle
released
as
gently
as
possible
by
Richard
,
who
slipped
upstairs
in
his
socks
and
then
,
as
often
as
not
,
dropped
his
hot-water
bottle
and
swore
!
How
she
laughed
!
But
this
question
of
love
(
she
thought
,
putting
her
coat
away
)
,
this
falling
in
love
with
women
.
Take
Sally
Seton
;
her
relation
in
the
old
days
with
Sally
Seton
.
Had
not
that
,
after
all
,
been
love
?
She
sat
on
the
floor
--
that
was
her
first
impression
of
Sally
--
she
sat
on
the
floor
with
her
arms
round
her
knees
,
smoking
a
cigarette
.
Where
could
it
have
been
?
The
Mannings
?
The
Kinloch-Jones
's
?
At
some
party
(
where
,
she
could
not
be
certain
)
,
for
she
had
a
distinct
recollection
of
saying
to
the
man
she
was
with
,
``
Who
is
that
?
''
And
he
had
told
her
,
and
said
that
Sally
's
parents
did
not
get
on
(
how
that
shocked
her
--
that
one
's
parents
should
quarrel
!
)
.
But
all
that
evening
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
off
Sally
.
It
was
an
extraordinary
beauty
of
the
kind
she
most
admired
,
dark
,
large-eyed
,
with
that
quality
which
,
since
she
had
n't
got
it
herself
,
she
always
envied
--
a
sort
of
abandonment
,
as
if
she
could
say
anything
,
do
anything
;
a
quality
much
commoner
in
foreigners
than
in
Englishwomen
.
Sally
always
said
she
had
French
blood
in
her
veins
,
an
ancestor
had
been
with
Marie
Antoinette
,
had
his
head
cut
off
,
left
a
ruby
ring
.
Perhaps
that
summer
she
came
to
stay
at
Bourton
,
walking
in
quite
unexpectedly
without
a
penny
in
her
pocket
,
one
night
after
dinner
,
and
upsetting
poor
Aunt
Helena
to
such
an
extent
that
she
never
forgave
her
.
There
had
been
some
quarrel
at
home
.
She
literally
had
n't
a
penny
that
night
when
she
came
to
them
--
had
pawned
a
brooch
to
come
down
.
She
had
rushed
off
in
a
passion
.
They
sat
up
till
all
hours
of
the
night
talking
.
Sally
it
was
who
made
her
feel
,
for
the
first
time
,
how
sheltered
the
life
at
Bourton
was
.
She
knew
nothing
about
sex
--
nothing
about
social
problems
.
She
had
once
seen
an
old
man
who
had
dropped
dead
in
a
field
--
she
had
seen
cows
just
after
their
calves
were
born
.
But
Aunt
Helena
never
liked
discussion
of
anything
(
when
Sally
gave
her
William
Morris
,
it
had
to
be
wrapped
in
brown
paper
)
.
There
they
sat
,
hour
after
hour
,
talking
in
her
bedroom
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
talking
about
life
,
how
they
were
to
reform
the
world
.
They
meant
to
found
a
society
to
abolish
private
property
,
and
actually
had
a
letter
written
,
though
not
sent
out
.
The
ideas
were
Sally
's
,
of
course
--
but
very
soon
she
was
just
as
excited
--
read
Plato
in
bed
before
breakfast
;
read
Morris
;
read
Shelley
by
the
hour
.
Sally
's
power
was
amazing
,
her
gift
,
her
personality
.
There
was
her
way
with
flowers
,
for
instance
.
At
Bourton
they
always
had
stiff
little
vases
all
the
way
down
the
table
.
Sally
went
out
,
picked
hollyhocks
,
dahlias
--
all
sorts
of
flowers
that
had
never
been
seen
together
--
cut
their
heads
off
,
and
made
them
swim
on
the
top
of
water
in
bowls
.
The
effect
was
extraordinary
--
coming
in
to
dinner
in
the
sunset
.
(
Of
course
Aunt
Helena
thought
it
wicked
to
treat
flowers
like
that
.
)
Then
she
forgot
her
sponge
,
and
ran
along
the
passage
naked
.
That
grim
old
housemaid
,
Ellen
Atkins
,
went
about
grumbling
--
''
Suppose
any
of
the
gentlemen
had
seen
?
''
Indeed
she
did
shock
people
.
She
was
untidy
,
Papa
said
.
The
strange
thing
,
on
looking
back
,
was
the
purity
,
the
integrity
,
of
her
feeling
for
Sally
.
It
was
not
like
one
's
feeling
for
a
man
.
It
was
completely
disinterested
,
and
besides
,
it
had
a
quality
which
could
only
exist
between
women
,
between
women
just
grown
up
.
It
was
protective
,
on
her
side
;
sprang
from
a
sense
of
being
in
league
together
,
a
presentiment
of
something
that
was
bound
to
part
them
(
they
spoke
of
marriage
always
as
a
catastrophe
)
,
which
led
to
this
chivalry
,
this
protective
feeling
which
was
much
more
on
her
side
than
Sally
's
.
For
in
those
days
she
was
completely
reckless
;
did
the
most
idiotic
things
out
of
bravado
;
bicycled
round
the
parapet
on
the
terrace
;
smoked
cigars
.
Absurd
,
she
was
--
very
absurd
.
But
the
charm
was
overpowering
,
to
her
at
least
,
so
that
she
could
remember
standing
in
her
bedroom
at
the
top
of
the
house
holding
the
hot-water
can
in
her
hands
and
saying
aloud
,
``
She
is
beneath
this
roof
.
.
.
.
She
is
beneath
this
roof
!
''
No
,
the
words
meant
absolutely
nothing
to
her
now
.
She
could
not
even
get
an
echo
of
her
old
emotion
.
But
she
could
remember
going
cold
with
excitement
,
and
doing
her
hair
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
(
now
the
old
feeling
began
to
come
back
to
her
,
as
she
took
out
her
hairpins
,
laid
them
on
the
dressing-table
,
began
to
do
her
hair
)
,
with
the
rooks
flaunting
up
and
down
in
the
pink
evening
light
,
and
dressing
,
and
going
downstairs
,
and
feeling
as
she
crossed
the
hall
``
if
it
were
now
to
die
'twere
now
to
be
most
happy
.
''
That
was
her
feeling
--
Othello
's
feeling
,
and
she
felt
it
,
she
was
convinced
,
as
strongly
as
Shakespeare
meant
Othello
to
feel
it
,
all
because
she
was
coming
down
to
dinner
in
a
white
frock
to
meet
Sally
Seton
!
She
was
wearing
pink
gauze
--
was
that
possible
?
She
seemed
,
anyhow
,
all
light
,
glowing
,
like
some
bird
or
air
ball
that
has
flown
in
,
attached
itself
for
a
moment
to
a
bramble
.
But
nothing
is
so
strange
when
one
is
in
love
(
and
what
was
this
except
being
in
love
?
)
as
the
complete
indifference
of
other
people
.
Aunt
Helena
just
wandered
off
after
dinner
;
Papa
read
the
paper
.
Peter
Walsh
might
have
been
there
,
and
old
Miss
Cummings
;
Joseph
Breitkopf
certainly
was
,
for
he
came
every
summer
,
poor
old
man
,
for
weeks
and
weeks
,
and
pretended
to
read
German
with
her
,
but
really
played
the
piano
and
sang
Brahms
without
any
voice
.
All
this
was
only
a
background
for
Sally
.
She
stood
by
the
fireplace
talking
,
in
that
beautiful
voice
which
made
everything
she
said
sound
like
a
caress
,
to
Papa
,
who
had
begun
to
be
attracted
rather
against
his
will
(
he
never
got
over
lending
her
one
of
his
books
and
finding
it
soaked
on
the
terrace
)
,
when
suddenly
she
said
,
``
What
a
shame
to
sit
indoors
!
''
and
they
all
went
out
on
to
the
terrace
and
walked
up
and
down
.
Peter
Walsh
and
Joseph
Breitkopf
went
on
about
Wagner
.
She
and
Sally
fell
a
little
behind
.
Then
came
the
most
exquisite
moment
of
her
whole
life
passing
a
stone
urn
with
flowers
in
it
.
Sally
stopped
;
picked
a
flower
;
kissed
her
on
the
lips
.
The
whole
world
might
have
turned
upside
down
!
The
others
disappeared
;
there
she
was
alone
with
Sally
.
And
she
felt
that
she
had
been
given
a
present
,
wrapped
up
,
and
told
just
to
keep
it
,
not
to
look
at
it
--
a
diamond
,
something
infinitely
precious
,
wrapped
up
,
which
,
as
they
walked
(
up
and
down
,
up
and
down
)
,
she
uncovered
,
or
the
radiance
burnt
through
,
the
revelation
,
the
religious
feeling
!
--
when
old
Joseph
and
Peter
faced
them
:
``
Star-gazing
?
''
said
Peter
.
It
was
like
running
one
's
face
against
a
granite
wall
in
the
darkness
!
It
was
shocking
;
it
was
horrible
!
Not
for
herself
.
She
felt
only
how
Sally
was
being
mauled
already
,
maltreated
;
she
felt
his
hostility
;
his
jealousy
;
his
determination
to
break
into
their
companionship
.
All
this
she
saw
as
one
sees
a
landscape
in
a
flash
of
lightning
--
and
Sally
(
never
had
she
admired
her
so
much
!
)
gallantly
taking
her
way
unvanquished
.
She
laughed
.
She
made
old
Joseph
tell
her
the
names
of
the
stars
,
which
he
liked
doing
very
seriously
.
She
stood
there
:
she
listened
.
She
heard
the
names
of
the
stars
.
``
Oh
this
horror
!
''
she
said
to
herself
,
as
if
she
had
known
all
along
that
something
would
interrupt
,
would
embitter
her
moment
of
happiness
.
Yet
,
after
all
,
how
much
she
owed
to
him
later
.
Always
when
she
thought
of
him
she
thought
of
their
quarrels
for
some
reason
--
because
she
wanted
his
good
opinion
so
much
,
perhaps
.
She
owed
him
words
:
``
sentimental
,
''
``
civilised
''
;
they
started
up
every
day
of
her
life
as
if
he
guarded
her
.
A
book
was
sentimental
;
an
attitude
to
life
sentimental
.
``
Sentimental
,
''
perhaps
she
was
to
be
thinking
of
the
past
.
What
would
he
think
,
she
wondered
,
when
he
came
back
?
That
she
had
grown
older
?
Would
he
say
that
,
or
would
she
see
him
thinking
when
he
came
back
,
that
she
had
grown
older
?
It
was
true
.
Since
her
illness
she
had
turned
almost
white
.
Laying
her
brooch
on
the
table
,
she
had
a
sudden
spasm
,
as
if
,
while
she
mused
,
the
icy
claws
had
had
the
chance
to
fix
in
her
.
She
was
not
old
yet
.
She
had
just
broken
into
her
fifty-second
year
.
Months
and
months
of
it
were
still
untouched
.
June
,
July
,
August
!
Each
still
remained
almost
whole
,
and
,
as
if
to
catch
the
falling
drop
,
Clarissa
(
crossing
to
the
dressing-table
)
plunged
into
the
very
heart
of
the
moment
,
transfixed
it
,
there
--
the
moment
of
this
June
morning
on
which
was
the
pressure
of
all
the
other
mornings
,
seeing
the
glass
,
the
dressing-table
,
and
all
the
bottles
afresh
,
collecting
the
whole
of
her
at
one
point
(
as
she
looked
into
the
glass
)
,
seeing
the
delicate
pink
face
of
the
woman
who
was
that
very
night
to
give
a
party
;
of
Clarissa
Dalloway
;
of
herself
.
How
many
million
times
she
had
seen
her
face
,
and
always
with
the
same
imperceptible
contraction
!
She
pursed
her
lips
when
she
looked
in
the
glass
.
It
was
to
give
her
face
point
.
That
was
her
self
--
pointed
;
dartlike
;
definite
.
That
was
her
self
when
some
effort
,
some
call
on
her
to
be
her
self
,
drew
the
parts
together
,
she
alone
knew
how
different
,
how
incompatible
and
composed
so
for
the
world
only
into
one
centre
,
one
diamond
,
one
woman
who
sat
in
her
drawing-room
and
made
a
meeting-point
,
a
radiancy
no
doubt
in
some
dull
lives
,
a
refuge
for
the
lonely
to
come
to
,
perhaps
;
she
had
helped
young
people
,
who
were
grateful
to
her
;
had
tried
to
be
the
same
always
,
never
showing
a
sign
of
all
the
other
sides
of
her
--
faults
,
jealousies
,
vanities
,
suspicions
,
like
this
of
Lady
Bruton
not
asking
her
to
lunch
;
which
,
she
thought
(
combing
her
hair
finally
)
,
is
utterly
base
!
Now
,
where
was
her
dress
?
Her
evening
dresses
hung
in
the
cupboard
.
Clarissa
,
plunging
her
hand
into
the
softness
,
gently
detached
the
green
dress
and
carried
it
to
the
window
.
She
had
torn
it
.
Some
one
had
trod
on
the
skirt
.
She
had
felt
it
give
at
the
Embassy
party
at
the
top
among
the
folds
.
By
artificial
light
the
green
shone
,
but
lost
its
colour
now
in
the
sun
.
She
would
mend
it
.
Her
maids
had
too
much
to
do
.
She
would
wear
it
to-night
.
She
would
take
her
silks
,
her
scissors
,
her
--
what
was
it
?
--
her
thimble
,
of
course
,
down
into
the
drawing-room
,
for
she
must
also
write
,
and
see
that
things
generally
were
more
or
less
in
order
.
Strange
,
she
thought
,
pausing
on
the
landing
,
and
assembling
that
diamond
shape
,
that
single
person
,
strange
how
a
mistress
knows
the
very
moment
,
the
very
temper
of
her
house
!
Faint
sounds
rose
in
spirals
up
the
well
of
the
stairs
;
the
swish
of
a
mop
;
tapping
;
knocking
;
a
loudness
when
the
front
door
opened
;
a
voice
repeating
a
message
in
the
basement
;
the
chink
of
silver
on
a
tray
;
clean
silver
for
the
party
.
All
was
for
the
party
.
(
And
Lucy
,
coming
into
the
drawing-room
with
her
tray
held
out
,
put
the
giant
candlesticks
on
the
mantelpiece
,
the
silver
casket
in
the
middle
,
turned
the
crystal
dolphin
towards
the
clock
.
They
would
come
;
they
would
stand
;
they
would
talk
in
the
mincing
tones
which
she
could
imitate
,
ladies
and
gentlemen
.
Of
all
,
her
mistress
was
loveliest
--
mistress
of
silver
,
of
linen
,
of
china
,
for
the
sun
,
the
silver
,
doors
off
their
hinges
,
Rumpelmayer
's
men
,
gave
her
a
sense
,
as
she
laid
the
paper-knife
on
the
inlaid
table
,
of
something
achieved
.
Behold
!
Behold
!
she
said
,
speaking
to
her
old
friends
in
the
baker
's
shop
,
where
she
had
first
seen
service
at
Caterham
,
prying
into
the
glass
.
She
was
Lady
Angela
,
attending
Princess
Mary
,
when
in
came
Mrs
.
Dalloway
.
)
``
Oh
Lucy
,
''
she
said
,
``
the
silver
does
look
nice
!
''
``
And
how
,
''
she
said
,
turning
the
crystal
dolphin
to
stand
straight
,
``
how
did
you
enjoy
the
play
last
night
?
''
``
Oh
,
they
had
to
go
before
the
end
!
''
she
said
.
``
They
had
to
be
back
at
ten
!
''
she
said
.
``
So
they
do
n't
know
what
happened
,
''
she
said
.
``
That
does
seem
hard
luck
,
''
she
said
(
for
her
servants
stayed
later
,
if
they
asked
her
)
.
``
That
does
seem
rather
a
shame
,
''
she
said
,
taking
the
old
bald-looking
cushion
in
the
middle
of
the
sofa
and
putting
it
in
Lucy
's
arms
,
and
giving
her
a
little
push
,
and
crying
:
``
Take
it
away
!
Give
it
to
Mrs.
Walker
with
my
compliments
!
Take
it
away
!
''
she
cried
.
And
Lucy
stopped
at
the
drawing-room
door
,
holding
the
cushion
,
and
said
,
very
shyly
,
turning
a
little
pink
,
Could
n't
she
help
to
mend
that
dress
?
But
,
said
Mrs.
Dalloway
,
she
had
enough
on
her
hands
already
,
quite
enough
of
her
own
to
do
without
that
.
``
But
,
thank
you
,
Lucy
,
oh
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Mrs.
Dalloway
,
and
thank
you
,
thank
you
,
she
went
on
saying
(
sitting
down
on
the
sofa
with
her
dress
over
her
knees
,
her
scissors
,
her
silks
)
,
thank
you
,
thank
you
,
she
went
on
saying
in
gratitude
to
her
servants
generally
for
helping
her
to
be
like
this
,
to
be
what
she
wanted
,
gentle
,
generous-hearted
.
Her
servants
liked
her
.
And
then
this
dress
of
hers
--
where
was
the
tear
?
and
now
her
needle
to
be
threaded
.
This
was
a
favourite
dress
,
one
of
Sally
Parker
's
,
the
last
almost
she
ever
made
,
alas
,
for
Sally
had
now
retired
,
living
at
Ealing
,
and
if
ever
I
have
a
moment
,
thought
Clarissa
(
but
never
would
she
have
a
moment
any
more
)
,
I
shall
go
and
see
her
at
Ealing
.
For
she
was
a
character
,
thought
Clarissa
,
a
real
artist
.
She
thought
of
little
out-of-the-way
things
;
yet
her
dresses
were
never
queer
.
You
could
wear
them
at
Hatfield
;
at
Buckingham
Palace
.
She
had
worn
them
at
Hatfield
;
at
Buckingham
Palace
.
Quiet
descended
on
her
,
calm
,
content
,
as
her
needle
,
drawing
the
silk
smoothly
to
its
gentle
pause
,
collected
the
green
folds
together
and
attached
them
,
very
lightly
,
to
the
belt
.
So
on
a
summer
's
day
waves
collect
,
overbalance
,
and
fall
;
collect
and
fall
;
and
the
whole
world
seems
to
be
saying
``
that
is
all
''
more
and
more
ponderously
,
until
even
the
heart
in
the
body
which
lies
in
the
sun
on
the
beach
says
too
,
That
is
all
.
Fear
no
more
,
says
the
heart
.
Fear
no
more
,
says
the
heart
,
committing
its
burden
to
some
sea
,
which
sighs
collectively
for
all
sorrows
,
and
renews
,
begins
,
collects
,
lets
fall
.
And
the
body
alone
listens
to
the
passing
bee
;
the
wave
breaking
;
the
dog
barking
,
far
away
barking
and
barking
.
``
Heavens
,
the
front-door
bell
!
''
exclaimed
Clarissa
,
staying
her
needle
.
Roused
,
she
listened
.
``
Mrs.
Dalloway
will
see
me
,
''
said
the
elderly
man
in
the
hall
.
``
Oh
yes
,
she
will
see
me
,
''
he
repeated
,
putting
Lucy
aside
very
benevolently
,
and
running
upstairs
ever
so
quickly
.
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
''
he
muttered
as
he
ran
upstairs
.
``
She
will
see
me
.
After
five
years
in
India
,
Clarissa
will
see
me
.
''
``
Who
can
--
what
can
,
''
asked
Mrs.
Dalloway
(
thinking
it
was
outrageous
to
be
interrupted
at
eleven
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
the
day
she
was
giving
a
party
)
,
hearing
a
step
on
the
stairs
.
She
heard
a
hand
upon
the
door
.
She
made
to
hide
her
dress
,
like
a
virgin
protecting
chastity
,
respecting
privacy
.
Now
the
brass
knob
slipped
.
Now
the
door
opened
,
and
in
came
--
for
a
single
second
she
could
not
remember
what
he
was
called
!
so
surprised
she
was
to
see
him
,
so
glad
,
so
shy
,
so
utterly
taken
aback
to
have
Peter
Walsh
come
to
her
unexpectedly
in
the
morning
!
(
She
had
not
read
his
letter
.
)
``
And
how
are
you
?
''
said
Peter
Walsh
,
positively
trembling
;
taking
both
her
hands
;
kissing
both
her
hands
.
She
's
grown
older
,
he
thought
,
sitting
down
.
I
sha
n't
tell
her
anything
about
it
,
he
thought
,
for
she
's
grown
older
.
She
's
looking
at
me
,
he
thought
,
a
sudden
embarrassment
coming
over
him
,
though
he
had
kissed
her
hands
.
Putting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
he
took
out
a
large
pocket-knife
and
half
opened
the
blade
.
Exactly
the
same
,
thought
Clarissa
;
the
same
queer
look
;
the
same
check
suit
;
a
little
out
of
the
straight
his
face
is
,
a
little
thinner
,
dryer
,
perhaps
,
but
he
looks
awfully
well
,
and
just
the
same
.
``
How
heavenly
it
is
to
see
you
again
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
He
had
his
knife
out
.
That
's
so
like
him
,
she
thought
.
He
had
only
reached
town
last
night
,
he
said
;
would
have
to
go
down
into
the
country
at
once
;
and
how
was
everything
,
how
was
everybody
--
Richard
?
Elizabeth
?
``
And
what
's
all
this
?
''
he
said
,
tilting
his
pen-knife
towards
her
green
dress
.
He
's
very
well
dressed
,
thought
Clarissa
;
yet
he
always
criticises
me
.
Here
she
is
mending
her
dress
;
mending
her
dress
as
usual
,
he
thought
;
here
she
's
been
sitting
all
the
time
I
've
been
in
India
;
mending
her
dress
;
playing
about
;
going
to
parties
;
running
to
the
House
and
back
and
all
that
,
he
thought
,
growing
more
and
more
irritated
,
more
and
more
agitated
,
for
there
's
nothing
in
the
world
so
bad
for
some
women
as
marriage
,
he
thought
;
and
politics
;
and
having
a
Conservative
husband
,
like
the
admirable
Richard
.
So
it
is
,
so
it
is
,
he
thought
,
shutting
his
knife
with
a
snap
.
``
Richard
's
very
well
.
Richard
's
at
a
Committee
,
''
said
Clarissa
.
And
she
opened
her
scissors
,
and
said
,
did
he
mind
her
just
finishing
what
she
was
doing
to
her
dress
,
for
they
had
a
party
that
night
?
``
Which
I
sha
n't
ask
you
to
,
''
she
said
.
``
My
dear
Peter
!
''
she
said
.
But
it
was
delicious
to
hear
her
say
that
--
my
dear
Peter
!
Indeed
,
it
was
all
so
delicious
--
the
silver
,
the
chairs
;
all
so
delicious
!
Why
would
n't
she
ask
him
to
her
party
?
he
asked
.
Now
of
course
,
thought
Clarissa
,
he
's
enchanting
!
perfectly
enchanting
!
Now
I
remember
how
impossible
it
was
ever
to
make
up
my
mind
--
and
why
did
I
make
up
my
mind
--
not
to
marry
him
?
she
wondered
,
that
awful
summer
?
``
But
it
's
so
extraordinary
that
you
should
have
come
this
morning
!
''
she
cried
,
putting
her
hands
,
one
on
top
of
another
,
down
on
her
dress
.
``
Do
you
remember
,
''
she
said
,
``
how
the
blinds
used
to
flap
at
Bourton
?
''
``
They
did
,
''
he
said
;
and
he
remembered
breakfasting
alone
,
very
awkwardly
,
with
her
father
;
who
had
died
;
and
he
had
not
written
to
Clarissa
.
But
he
had
never
got
on
well
with
old
Parry
,
that
querulous
,
weak-kneed
old
man
,
Clarissa
's
father
,
Justin
Parry
.
``
I
often
wish
I
'd
got
on
better
with
your
father
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
he
never
liked
any
one
who
--
our
friends
,
''
said
Clarissa
;
and
could
have
bitten
her
tongue
for
thus
reminding
Peter
that
he
had
wanted
to
marry
her
.
Of
course
I
did
,
thought
Peter
;
it
almost
broke
my
heart
too
,
he
thought
;
and
was
overcome
with
his
own
grief
,
which
rose
like
a
moon
looked
at
from
a
terrace
,
ghastly
beautiful
with
light
from
the
sunken
day
.
I
was
more
unhappy
than
I
've
ever
been
since
,
he
thought
.
And
as
if
in
truth
he
were
sitting
there
on
the
terrace
he
edged
a
little
towards
Clarissa
;
put
his
hand
out
;
raised
it
;
let
it
fall
.
There
above
them
it
hung
,
that
moon
.
She
too
seemed
to
be
sitting
with
him
on
the
terrace
,
in
the
moonlight
.
``
Herbert
has
it
now
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
never
go
there
now
,
''
she
said
.
Then
,
just
as
happens
on
a
terrace
in
the
moonlight
,
when
one
person
begins
to
feel
ashamed
that
he
is
already
bored
,
and
yet
as
the
other
sits
silent
,
very
quiet
,
sadly
looking
at
the
moon
,
does
not
like
to
speak
,
moves
his
foot
,
clears
his
throat
,
notices
some
iron
scroll
on
a
table
leg
,
stirs
a
leaf
,
but
says
nothing
--
so
Peter
Walsh
did
now
.
For
why
go
back
like
this
to
the
past
?
he
thought
.
Why
make
him
think
of
it
again
?
Why
make
him
suffer
,
when
she
had
tortured
him
so
infernally
?
Why
?
``
Do
you
remember
the
lake
?
''
she
said
,
in
an
abrupt
voice
,
under
the
pressure
of
an
emotion
which
caught
her
heart
,
made
the
muscles
of
her
throat
stiff
,
and
contracted
her
lips
in
a
spasm
as
she
said
``
lake
.
''
For
she
was
a
child
,
throwing
bread
to
the
ducks
,
between
her
parents
,
and
at
the
same
time
a
grown
woman
coming
to
her
parents
who
stood
by
the
lake
,
holding
her
life
in
her
arms
which
,
as
she
neared
them
,
grew
larger
and
larger
in
her
arms
,
until
it
became
a
whole
life
,
a
complete
life
,
which
she
put
down
by
them
and
said
,
``
This
is
what
I
have
made
of
it
!
This
!
''
And
what
had
she
made
of
it
?
What
,
indeed
?
sitting
there
sewing
this
morning
with
Peter
.
She
looked
at
Peter
Walsh
;
her
look
,
passing
through
all
that
time
and
that
emotion
,
reached
him
doubtfully
;
settled
on
him
tearfully
;
and
rose
and
fluttered
away
,
as
a
bird
touches
a
branch
and
rises
and
flutters
away
.
Quite
simply
she
wiped
her
eyes
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
Peter
.
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
''
he
said
,
as
if
she
drew
up
to
the
surface
something
which
positively
hurt
him
as
it
rose
.
Stop
!
Stop
!
he
wanted
to
cry
.
For
he
was
not
old
;
his
life
was
not
over
;
not
by
any
means
.
He
was
only
just
past
fifty
.
Shall
I
tell
her
,
he
thought
,
or
not
?
He
would
like
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
all
.
But
she
is
too
cold
,
he
thought
;
sewing
,
with
her
scissors
;
Daisy
would
look
ordinary
beside
Clarissa
.
And
she
would
think
me
a
failure
,
which
I
am
in
their
sense
,
he
thought
;
in
the
Dalloways
'
sense
.
Oh
yes
,
he
had
no
doubt
about
that
;
he
was
a
failure
,
compared
with
all
this
--
the
inlaid
table
,
the
mounted
paper-knife
,
the
dolphin
and
the
candlesticks
,
the
chair-covers
and
the
old
valuable
English
tinted
prints
--
he
was
a
failure
!
I
detest
the
smugness
of
the
whole
affair
,
he
thought
;
Richard
's
doing
,
not
Clarissa
's
;
save
that
she
married
him
.
(
Here
Lucy
came
into
the
room
,
carrying
silver
,
more
silver
,
but
charming
,
slender
,
graceful
she
looked
,
he
thought
,
as
she
stooped
to
put
it
down
.
)
And
this
has
been
going
on
all
the
time
!
he
thought
;
week
after
week
;
Clarissa
's
life
;
while
I
--
he
thought
;
and
at
once
everything
seemed
to
radiate
from
him
;
journeys
;
rides
;
quarrels
;
adventures
;
bridge
parties
;
love
affairs
;
work
;
work
,
work
!
and
he
took
out
his
knife
quite
openly
--
his
old
horn-handled
knife
which
Clarissa
could
swear
he
had
had
these
thirty
years
--
and
clenched
his
fist
upon
it
.
What
an
extraordinary
habit
that
was
,
Clarissa
thought
;
always
playing
with
a
knife
.
Always
making
one
feel
,
too
,
frivolous
;
empty-minded
;
a
mere
silly
chatterbox
,
as
he
used
.
But
I
too
,
she
thought
,
and
,
taking
up
her
needle
,
summoned
,
like
a
Queen
whose
guards
have
fallen
asleep
and
left
her
unprotected
(
she
had
been
quite
taken
aback
by
this
visit
--
it
had
upset
her
)
so
that
any
one
can
stroll
in
and
have
a
look
at
her
where
she
lies
with
the
brambles
curving
over
her
,
summoned
to
her
help
the
things
she
did
;
the
things
she
liked
;
her
husband
;
Elizabeth
;
her
self
,
in
short
,
which
Peter
hardly
knew
now
,
all
to
come
about
her
and
beat
off
the
enemy
.
``
Well
,
and
what
's
happened
to
you
?
''
she
said
.
So
before
a
battle
begins
,
the
horses
paw
the
ground
;
toss
their
heads
;
the
light
shines
on
their
flanks
;
their
necks
curve
.
So
Peter
Walsh
and
Clarissa
,
sitting
side
by
side
on
the
blue
sofa
,
challenged
each
other
.
His
powers
chafed
and
tossed
in
him
.
He
assembled
from
different
quarters
all
sorts
of
things
;
praise
;
his
career
at
Oxford
;
his
marriage
,
which
she
knew
nothing
whatever
about
;
how
he
had
loved
;
and
altogether
done
his
job
.
``
Millions
of
things
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
and
,
urged
by
the
assembly
of
powers
which
were
now
charging
this
way
and
that
and
giving
him
the
feeling
at
once
frightening
and
extremely
exhilarating
of
being
rushed
through
the
air
on
the
shoulders
of
people
he
could
no
longer
see
,
he
raised
his
hands
to
his
forehead
.
Clarissa
sat
very
upright
;
drew
in
her
breath
.
``
I
am
in
love
,
''
he
said
,
not
to
her
however
,
but
to
some
one
raised
up
in
the
dark
so
that
you
could
not
touch
her
but
must
lay
your
garland
down
on
the
grass
in
the
dark
.
``
In
love
,
''
he
repeated
,
now
speaking
rather
dryly
to
Clarissa
Dalloway
;
``
in
love
with
a
girl
in
India
.
''
He
had
deposited
his
garland
.
Clarissa
could
make
what
she
would
of
it
.
``
In
love
!
''
she
said
.
That
he
at
his
age
should
be
sucked
under
in
his
little
bow-tie
by
that
monster
!
And
there
's
no
flesh
on
his
neck
;
his
hands
are
red
;
and
he
's
six
months
older
than
I
am
!
her
eye
flashed
back
to
her
;
but
in
her
heart
she
felt
,
all
the
same
,
he
is
in
love
.
He
has
that
,
she
felt
;
he
is
in
love
.
But
the
indomitable
egotism
which
for
ever
rides
down
the
hosts
opposed
to
it
,
the
river
which
says
on
,
on
,
on
;
even
though
,
it
admits
,
there
may
be
no
goal
for
us
whatever
,
still
on
,
on
;
this
indomitable
egotism
charged
her
cheeks
with
colour
;
made
her
look
very
young
;
very
pink
;
very
bright-eyed
as
she
sat
with
her
dress
upon
her
knee
,
and
her
needle
held
to
the
end
of
green
silk
,
trembling
a
little
.
He
was
in
love
!
Not
with
her
.
With
some
younger
woman
,
of
course
.
``
And
who
is
she
?
''
she
asked
.
Now
this
statue
must
be
brought
from
its
height
and
set
down
between
them
.
``
A
married
woman
,
unfortunately
,
''
he
said
;
``
the
wife
of
a
Major
in
the
Indian
Army
.
''
And
with
a
curious
ironical
sweetness
he
smiled
as
he
placed
her
in
this
ridiculous
way
before
Clarissa
.
(
All
the
same
,
he
is
in
love
,
thought
Clarissa
.
)
``
She
has
,
''
he
continued
,
very
reasonably
,
``
two
small
children
;
a
boy
and
a
girl
;
and
I
have
come
over
to
see
my
lawyers
about
the
divorce
.
''
There
they
are
!
he
thought
.
Do
what
you
like
with
them
,
Clarissa
!
There
they
are
!
And
second
by
second
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
wife
of
the
Major
in
the
Indian
Army
(
his
Daisy
)
and
her
two
small
children
became
more
and
more
lovely
as
Clarissa
looked
at
them
;
as
if
he
had
set
light
to
a
grey
pellet
on
a
plate
and
there
had
risen
up
a
lovely
tree
in
the
brisk
sea-salted
air
of
their
intimacy
(
for
in
some
ways
no
one
understood
him
,
felt
with
him
,
as
Clarissa
did
)
--
their
exquisite
intimacy
.
She
flattered
him
;
she
fooled
him
,
thought
Clarissa
;
shaping
the
woman
,
the
wife
of
the
Major
in
the
Indian
Army
,
with
three
strokes
of
a
knife
.
What
a
waste
!
What
a
folly
!
All
his
life
long
Peter
had
been
fooled
like
that
;
first
getting
sent
down
from
Oxford
;
next
marrying
the
girl
on
the
boat
going
out
to
India
;
now
the
wife
of
a
Major
in
the
Indian
Army
--
thank
Heaven
she
had
refused
to
marry
him
!
Still
,
he
was
in
love
;
her
old
friend
,
her
dear
Peter
,
he
was
in
love
.
``
But
what
are
you
going
to
do
?
''
she
asked
him
.
Oh
the
lawyers
and
solicitors
,
Messrs.
Hooper
and
Grateley
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
they
were
going
to
do
it
,
he
said
.
And
he
actually
pared
his
nails
with
his
pocket-knife
.
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
leave
your
knife
alone
!
she
cried
to
herself
in
irrepressible
irritation
;
it
was
his
silly
unconventionality
,
his
weakness
;
his
lack
of
the
ghost
of
a
notion
what
any
one
else
was
feeling
that
annoyed
her
,
had
always
annoyed
her
;
and
now
at
his
age
,
how
silly
!
I
know
all
that
,
Peter
thought
;
I
know
what
I
'm
up
against
,
he
thought
,
running
his
finger
along
the
blade
of
his
knife
,
Clarissa
and
Dalloway
and
all
the
rest
of
them
;
but
I
'll
show
Clarissa
--
and
then
to
his
utter
surprise
,
suddenly
thrown
by
those
uncontrollable
forces
thrown
through
the
air
,
he
burst
into
tears
;
wept
;
wept
without
the
least
shame
,
sitting
on
the
sofa
,
the
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
.
And
Clarissa
had
leant
forward
,
taken
his
hand
,
drawn
him
to
her
,
kissed
him
,
--
actually
had
felt
his
face
on
hers
before
she
could
down
the
brandishing
of
silver
flashing
--
plumes
like
pampas
grass
in
a
tropic
gale
in
her
breast
,
which
,
subsiding
,
left
her
holding
his
hand
,
patting
his
knee
and
,
feeling
as
she
sat
back
extraordinarily
at
her
ease
with
him
and
light-hearted
,
all
in
a
clap
it
came
over
her
,
If
I
had
married
him
,
this
gaiety
would
have
been
mine
all
day
!
It
was
all
over
for
her
.
The
sheet
was
stretched
and
the
bed
narrow
.
She
had
gone
up
into
the
tower
alone
and
left
them
blackberrying
in
the
sun
.
The
door
had
shut
,
and
there
among
the
dust
of
fallen
plaster
and
the
litter
of
birds
'
nests
how
distant
the
view
had
looked
,
and
the
sounds
came
thin
and
chill
(
once
on
Leith
Hill
,
she
remembered
)
,
and
Richard
,
Richard
!
she
cried
,
as
a
sleeper
in
the
night
starts
and
stretches
a
hand
in
the
dark
for
help
.
Lunching
with
Lady
Bruton
,
it
came
back
to
her
.
He
has
left
me
;
I
am
alone
for
ever
,
she
thought
,
folding
her
hands
upon
her
knee
.
Peter
Walsh
had
got
up
and
crossed
to
the
window
and
stood
with
his
back
to
her
,
flicking
a
bandanna
handkerchief
from
side
to
side
.
Masterly
and
dry
and
desolate
he
looked
,
his
thin
shoulder-blades
lifting
his
coat
slightly
;
blowing
his
nose
violently
.
Take
me
with
you
,
Clarissa
thought
impulsively
,
as
if
he
were
starting
directly
upon
some
great
voyage
;
and
then
,
next
moment
,
it
was
as
if
the
five
acts
of
a
play
that
had
been
very
exciting
and
moving
were
now
over
and
she
had
lived
a
lifetime
in
them
and
had
run
away
,
had
lived
with
Peter
,
and
it
was
now
over
.
Now
it
was
time
to
move
,
and
,
as
a
woman
gathers
her
things
together
,
her
cloak
,
her
gloves
,
her
opera-glasses
,
and
gets
up
to
go
out
of
the
theatre
into
the
street
,
she
rose
from
the
sofa
and
went
to
Peter
.
And
it
was
awfully
strange
,
he
thought
,
how
she
still
had
the
power
,
as
she
came
tinkling
,
rustling
,
still
had
the
power
as
she
came
across
the
room
,
to
make
the
moon
,
which
he
detested
,
rise
at
Bourton
on
the
terrace
in
the
summer
sky
.
``
Tell
me
,
''
he
said
,
seizing
her
by
the
shoulders
.
``
Are
you
happy
,
Clarissa
?
Does
Richard
--
''
The
door
opened
.
``
Here
is
my
Elizabeth
,
''
said
Clarissa
,
emotionally
,
histrionically
,
perhaps
.
``
How
d'y
do
?
''
said
Elizabeth
coming
forward
.
The
sound
of
Big
Ben
striking
the
half-hour
struck
out
between
them
with
extraordinary
vigour
,
as
if
a
young
man
,
strong
,
indifferent
,
inconsiderate
,
were
swinging
dumb-bells
this
way
and
that
.
``
Hullo
,
Elizabeth
!
''
cried
Peter
,
stuffing
his
handkerchief
into
his
pocket
,
going
quickly
to
her
,
saying
``
Good-bye
,
Clarissa
''
without
looking
at
her
,
leaving
the
room
quickly
,
and
running
downstairs
and
opening
the
hall
door
.
``
Peter
!
Peter
!
''
cried
Clarissa
,
following
him
out
on
to
the
landing
.
``
My
party
to-night
!
Remember
my
party
to-night
!
''
she
cried
,
having
to
raise
her
voice
against
the
roar
of
the
open
air
,
and
,
overwhelmed
by
the
traffic
and
the
sound
of
all
the
clocks
striking
,
her
voice
crying
``
Remember
my
party
to-night
!
''
sounded
frail
and
thin
and
very
far
away
as
Peter
Walsh
shut
the
door
.
Remember
my
party
,
remember
my
party
,
said
Peter
Walsh
as
he
stepped
down
the
street
,
speaking
to
himself
rhythmically
,
in
time
with
the
flow
of
the
sound
,
the
direct
downright
sound
of
Big
Ben
striking
the
half-hour
.
(
The
leaden
circles
dissolved
in
the
air
.
)
Oh
these
parties
,
he
thought
;
Clarissa
's
parties
.
Why
does
she
give
these
parties
,
he
thought
.
Not
that
he
blamed
her
or
this
effigy
of
a
man
in
a
tail-coat
with
a
carnation
in
his
buttonhole
coming
towards
him
.
Only
one
person
in
the
world
could
be
as
he
was
,
in
love
.
And
there
he
was
,
this
fortunate
man
,
himself
,
reflected
in
the
plate-glass
window
of
a
motor-car
manufacturer
in
Victoria
Street
.
All
India
lay
behind
him
;
plains
,
mountains
;
epidemics
of
cholera
;
a
district
twice
as
big
as
Ireland
;
decisions
he
had
come
to
alone
--
he
,
Peter
Walsh
;
who
was
now
really
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
in
love
.
Clarissa
had
grown
hard
,
he
thought
;
and
a
trifle
sentimental
into
the
bargain
,
he
suspected
,
looking
at
the
great
motor-cars
capable
of
doing
--
how
many
miles
on
how
many
gallons
?
For
he
had
a
turn
for
mechanics
;
had
invented
a
plough
in
his
district
,
had
ordered
wheel-barrows
from
England
,
but
the
coolies
would
n't
use
them
,
all
of
which
Clarissa
knew
nothing
whatever
about
.
The
way
she
said
``
Here
is
my
Elizabeth
!
''
--
that
annoyed
him
.
Why
not
``
Here
's
Elizabeth
''
simply
?
It
was
insincere
.
And
Elizabeth
did
n't
like
it
either
.
(
Still
the
last
tremors
of
the
great
booming
voice
shook
the
air
round
him
;
the
half-hour
;
still
early
;
only
half-past
eleven
still
.
)
For
he
understood
young
people
;
he
liked
them
.
There
was
always
something
cold
in
Clarissa
,
he
thought
.
She
had
always
,
even
as
a
girl
,
a
sort
of
timidity
,
which
in
middle
age
becomes
conventionality
,
and
then
it
's
all
up
,
it
's
all
up
,
he
thought
,
looking
rather
drearily
into
the
glassy
depths
,
and
wondering
whether
by
calling
at
that
hour
he
had
annoyed
her
;
overcome
with
shame
suddenly
at
having
been
a
fool
;
wept
;
been
emotional
;
told
her
everything
,
as
usual
,
as
usual
.
As
a
cloud
crosses
the
sun
,
silence
falls
on
London
;
and
falls
on
the
mind
.
Effort
ceases
.
Time
flaps
on
the
mast
.
There
we
stop
;
there
we
stand
.
Rigid
,
the
skeleton
of
habit
alone
upholds
the
human
frame
.
Where
there
is
nothing
,
Peter
Walsh
said
to
himself
;
feeling
hollowed
out
,
utterly
empty
within
.
Clarissa
refused
me
,
he
thought
.
He
stood
there
thinking
,
Clarissa
refused
me
.
Ah
,
said
St.
Margaret
's
,
like
a
hostess
who
comes
into
her
drawing-room
on
the
very
stroke
of
the
hour
and
finds
her
guests
there
already
.
I
am
not
late
.
No
,
it
is
precisely
half-past
eleven
,
she
says
.
Yet
,
though
she
is
perfectly
right
,
her
voice
,
being
the
voice
of
the
hostess
,
is
reluctant
to
inflict
its
individuality
.
Some
grief
for
the
past
holds
it
back
;
some
concern
for
the
present
.
It
is
half-past
eleven
,
she
says
,
and
the
sound
of
St.
Margaret
's
glides
into
the
recesses
of
the
heart
and
buries
itself
in
ring
after
ring
of
sound
,
like
something
alive
which
wants
to
confide
itself
,
to
disperse
itself
,
to
be
,
with
a
tremor
of
delight
,
at
rest
--
like
Clarissa
herself
,
thought
Peter
Walsh
,
coming
down
the
stairs
on
the
stroke
of
the
hour
in
white
.
It
is
Clarissa
herself
,
he
thought
,
with
a
deep
emotion
,
and
an
extraordinarily
clear
,
yet
puzzling
,
recollection
of
her
,
as
if
this
bell
had
come
into
the
room
years
ago
,
where
they
sat
at
some
moment
of
great
intimacy
,
and
had
gone
from
one
to
the
other
and
had
left
,
like
a
bee
with
honey
,
laden
with
the
moment
.
But
what
room
?
What
moment
?
And
why
had
he
been
so
profoundly
happy
when
the
clock
was
striking
?
Then
,
as
the
sound
of
St.
Margaret
's
languished
,
he
thought
,
She
has
been
ill
,
and
the
sound
expressed
languor
and
suffering
.
It
was
her
heart
,
he
remembered
;
and
the
sudden
loudness
of
the
final
stroke
tolled
for
death
that
surprised
in
the
midst
of
life
,
Clarissa
falling
where
she
stood
,
in
her
drawing-room
.
No
!
No
!
he
cried
.
She
is
not
dead
!
I
am
not
old
,
he
cried
,
and
marched
up
Whitehall
,
as
if
there
rolled
down
to
him
,
vigorous
,
unending
,
his
future
.
He
was
not
old
,
or
set
,
or
dried
in
the
least
.
As
for
caring
what
they
said
of
him
--
the
Dalloways
,
the
Whitbreads
,
and
their
set
,
he
cared
not
a
straw
--
not
a
straw
(
though
it
was
true
he
would
have
,
some
time
or
other
,
to
see
whether
Richard
could
n't
help
him
to
some
job
)
.
Striding
,
staring
,
he
glared
at
the
statue
of
the
Duke
of
Cambridge
.
He
had
been
sent
down
from
Oxford
--
true
.
He
had
been
a
Socialist
,
in
some
sense
a
failure
--
true
.
Still
the
future
of
civilisation
lies
,
he
thought
,
in
the
hands
of
young
men
like
that
;
of
young
men
such
as
he
was
,
thirty
years
ago
;
with
their
love
of
abstract
principles
;
getting
books
sent
out
to
them
all
the
way
from
London
to
a
peak
in
the
Himalayas
;
reading
science
;
reading
philosophy
.
The
future
lies
in
the
hands
of
young
men
like
that
,
he
thought
.
A
patter
like
the
patter
of
leaves
in
a
wood
came
from
behind
,
and
with
it
a
rustling
,
regular
thudding
sound
,
which
as
it
overtook
him
drummed
his
thoughts
,
strict
in
step
,
up
Whitehall
,
without
his
doing
.
Boys
in
uniform
,
carrying
guns
,
marched
with
their
eyes
ahead
of
them
,
marched
,
their
arms
stiff
,
and
on
their
faces
an
expression
like
the
letters
of
a
legend
written
round
the
base
of
a
statue
praising
duty
,
gratitude
,
fidelity
,
love
of
England
.
It
is
,
thought
Peter
Walsh
,
beginning
to
keep
step
with
them
,
a
very
fine
training
.
But
they
did
not
look
robust
.
They
were
weedy
for
the
most
part
,
boys
of
sixteen
,
who
might
,
to-morrow
,
stand
behind
bowls
of
rice
,
cakes
of
soap
on
counters
.
Now
they
wore
on
them
unmixed
with
sensual
pleasure
or
daily
preoccupations
the
solemnity
of
the
wreath
which
they
had
fetched
from
Finsbury
Pavement
to
the
empty
tomb
.
They
had
taken
their
vow
.
The
traffic
respected
it
;
vans
were
stopped
.
I
ca
n't
keep
up
with
them
,
Peter
Walsh
thought
,
as
they
marched
up
Whitehall
,
and
sure
enough
,
on
they
marched
,
past
him
,
past
every
one
,
in
their
steady
way
,
as
if
one
will
worked
legs
and
arms
uniformly
,
and
life
,
with
its
varieties
,
its
irreticences
,
had
been
laid
under
a
pavement
of
monuments
and
wreaths
and
drugged
into
a
stiff
yet
staring
corpse
by
discipline
.
One
had
to
respect
it
;
one
might
laugh
;
but
one
had
to
respect
it
,
he
thought
.
There
they
go
,
thought
Peter
Walsh
,
pausing
at
the
edge
of
the
pavement
;
and
all
the
exalted
statues
,
Nelson
,
Gordon
,
Havelock
,
the
black
,
the
spectacular
images
of
great
soldiers
stood
looking
ahead
of
them
,
as
if
they
too
had
made
the
same
renunciation
(
Peter
Walsh
felt
he
too
had
made
it
,
the
great
renunciation
)
,
trampled
under
the
same
temptations
,
and
achieved
at
length
a
marble
stare
.
But
the
stare
Peter
Walsh
did
not
want
for
himself
in
the
least
;
though
he
could
respect
it
in
others
.
He
could
respect
it
in
boys
.
They
do
n't
know
the
troubles
of
the
flesh
yet
,
he
thought
,
as
the
marching
boys
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
Strand
--
all
that
I
've
been
through
,
he
thought
,
crossing
the
road
,
and
standing
under
Gordon
's
statue
,
Gordon
whom
as
a
boy
he
had
worshipped
;
Gordon
standing
lonely
with
one
leg
raised
and
his
arms
crossed
,
--
poor
Gordon
,
he
thought
.
And
just
because
nobody
yet
knew
he
was
in
London
,
except
Clarissa
,
and
the
earth
,
after
the
voyage
,
still
seemed
an
island
to
him
,
the
strangeness
of
standing
alone
,
alive
,
unknown
,
at
half-past
eleven
in
Trafalgar
Square
overcame
him
.
What
is
it
?
Where
am
I
?
And
why
,
after
all
,
does
one
do
it
?
he
thought
,
the
divorce
seeming
all
moonshine
.
And
down
his
mind
went
flat
as
a
marsh
,
and
three
great
emotions
bowled
over
him
;
understanding
;
a
vast
philanthropy
;
and
finally
,
as
if
the
result
of
the
others
,
an
irrepressible
,
exquisite
delight
;
as
if
inside
his
brain
by
another
hand
strings
were
pulled
,
shutters
moved
,
and
he
,
having
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
yet
stood
at
the
opening
of
endless
avenues
,
down
which
if
he
chose
he
might
wander
.
He
had
not
felt
so
young
for
years
.
He
had
escaped
!
was
utterly
free
--
as
happens
in
the
downfall
of
habit
when
the
mind
,
like
an
unguarded
flame
,
bows
and
bends
and
seems
about
to
blow
from
its
holding
.
I
have
n't
felt
so
young
for
years
!
thought
Peter
,
escaping
(
only
of
course
for
an
hour
or
so
)
from
being
precisely
what
he
was
,
and
feeling
like
a
child
who
runs
out
of
doors
,
and
sees
,
as
he
runs
,
his
old
nurse
waving
at
the
wrong
window
.
But
she
's
extraordinarily
attractive
,
he
thought
,
as
,
walking
across
Trafalgar
Square
in
the
direction
of
the
Haymarket
,
came
a
young
woman
who
,
as
she
passed
Gordon
's
statue
,
seemed
,
Peter
Walsh
thought
(
susceptible
as
he
was
)
,
to
shed
veil
after
veil
,
until
she
became
the
very
woman
he
had
always
had
in
mind
;
young
,
but
stately
;
merry
,
but
discreet
;
black
,
but
enchanting
.
Straightening
himself
and
stealthily
fingering
his
pocket-knife
he
started
after
her
to
follow
this
woman
,
this
excitement
,
which
seemed
even
with
its
back
turned
to
shed
on
him
a
light
which
connected
them
,
which
singled
him
out
,
as
if
the
random
uproar
of
the
traffic
had
whispered
through
hollowed
hands
his
name
,
not
Peter
,
but
his
private
name
which
he
called
himself
in
his
own
thoughts
.
``
You
,
''
she
said
,
only
``
you
,
''
saying
it
with
her
white
gloves
and
her
shoulders
.
Then
the
thin
long
cloak
which
the
wind
stirred
as
she
walked
past
Dent
's
shop
in
Cockspur
Street
blew
out
with
an
enveloping
kindness
,
a
mournful
tenderness
,
as
of
arms
that
would
open
and
take
the
tired
--
But
she
's
not
married
;
she
's
young
;
quite
young
,
thought
Peter
,
the
red
carnation
he
had
seen
her
wear
as
she
came
across
Trafalgar
Square
burning
again
in
his
eyes
and
making
her
lips
red
.
But
she
waited
at
the
kerbstone
.
There
was
a
dignity
about
her
.
She
was
not
worldly
,
like
Clarissa
;
not
rich
,
like
Clarissa
.
Was
she
,
he
wondered
as
she
moved
,
respectable
?
Witty
,
with
a
lizard
's
flickering
tongue
,
he
thought
(
for
one
must
invent
,
must
allow
oneself
a
little
diversion
)
,
a
cool
waiting
wit
,
a
darting
wit
;
not
noisy
.
She
moved
;
she
crossed
;
he
followed
her
.
To
embarrass
her
was
the
last
thing
he
wished
.
Still
if
she
stopped
he
would
say
``
Come
and
have
an
ice
,
''
he
would
say
,
and
she
would
answer
,
perfectly
simply
,
``
Oh
yes
.
''
But
other
people
got
between
them
in
the
street
,
obstructing
him
,
blotting
her
out
.
He
pursued
;
she
changed
.
There
was
colour
in
her
cheeks
;
mockery
in
her
eyes
;
he
was
an
adventurer
,
reckless
,
he
thought
,
swift
,
daring
,
indeed
(
landed
as
he
was
last
night
from
India
)
a
romantic
buccaneer
,
careless
of
all
these
damned
proprieties
,
yellow
dressing-gowns
,
pipes
,
fishing-rods
,
in
the
shop
windows
;
and
respectability
and
evening
parties
and
spruce
old
men
wearing
white
slips
beneath
their
waistcoats
.
He
was
a
buccaneer
.
On
and
on
she
went
,
across
Piccadilly
,
and
up
Regent
Street
,
ahead
of
him
,
her
cloak
,
her
gloves
,
her
shoulders
combining
with
the
fringes
and
the
laces
and
the
feather
boas
in
the
windows
to
make
the
spirit
of
finery
and
whimsy
which
dwindled
out
of
the
shops
on
to
the
pavement
,
as
the
light
of
a
lamp
goes
wavering
at
night
over
hedges
in
the
darkness
.
Laughing
and
delightful
,
she
had
crossed
Oxford
Street
and
Great
Portland
Street
and
turned
down
one
of
the
little
streets
,
and
now
,
and
now
,
the
great
moment
was
approaching
,
for
now
she
slackened
,
opened
her
bag
,
and
with
one
look
in
his
direction
,
but
not
at
him
,
one
look
that
bade
farewell
,
summed
up
the
whole
situation
and
dismissed
it
triumphantly
,
for
ever
,
had
fitted
her
key
,
opened
the
door
,
and
gone
!
Clarissa
's
voice
saying
,
Remember
my
party
,
Remember
my
party
,
sang
in
his
ears
.
The
house
was
one
of
those
flat
red
houses
with
hanging
flower-baskets
of
vague
impropriety
.
It
was
over
.
Well
,
I
've
had
my
fun
;
I
've
had
it
,
he
thought
,
looking
up
at
the
swinging
baskets
of
pale
geraniums
.
And
it
was
smashed
to
atoms
--
his
fun
,
for
it
was
half
made
up
,
as
he
knew
very
well
;
invented
,
this
escapade
with
the
girl
;
made
up
,
as
one
makes
up
the
better
part
of
life
,
he
thought
--
making
oneself
up
;
making
her
up
;
creating
an
exquisite
amusement
,
and
something
more
.
But
odd
it
was
,
and
quite
true
;
all
this
one
could
never
share
--
it
smashed
to
atoms
.
He
turned
;
went
up
the
street
,
thinking
to
find
somewhere
to
sit
,
till
it
was
time
for
Lincoln
's
Inn
--
for
Messrs.
Hooper
and
Grateley
.
Where
should
he
go
?
No
matter
.
Up
the
street
,
then
,
towards
Regent
's
Park
.
His
boots
on
the
pavement
struck
out
``
no
matter
''
;
for
it
was
early
,
still
very
early
.
It
was
a
splendid
morning
too
.
Like
the
pulse
of
a
perfect
heart
,
life
struck
straight
through
the
streets
.
There
was
no
fumbling
--
no
hesitation
.
Sweeping
and
swerving
,
accurately
,
punctually
,
noiselessly
,
there
,
precisely
at
the
right
instant
,
the
motor-car
stopped
at
the
door
.
The
girl
,
silk-stockinged
,
feathered
,
evanescent
,
but
not
to
him
particularly
attractive
(
for
he
had
had
his
fling
)
,
alighted
.
Admirable
butlers
,
tawny
chow
dogs
,
halls
laid
in
black
and
white
lozenges
with
white
blinds
blowing
,
Peter
saw
through
the
opened
door
and
approved
of
.
A
splendid
achievement
in
its
own
way
,
after
all
,
London
;
the
season
;
civilisation
.
Coming
as
he
did
from
a
respectable
Anglo-Indian
family
which
for
at
least
three
generations
had
administered
the
affairs
of
a
continent
(
it
's
strange
,
he
thought
,
what
a
sentiment
I
have
about
that
,
disliking
India
,
and
empire
,
and
army
as
he
did
)
,
there
were
moments
when
civilisation
,
even
of
this
sort
,
seemed
dear
to
him
as
a
personal
possession
;
moments
of
pride
in
England
;
in
butlers
;
chow
dogs
;
girls
in
their
security
.
Ridiculous
enough
,
still
there
it
is
,
he
thought
.
And
the
doctors
and
men
of
business
and
capable
women
all
going
about
their
business
,
punctual
,
alert
,
robust
,
seemed
to
him
wholly
admirable
,
good
fellows
,
to
whom
one
would
entrust
one
's
life
,
companions
in
the
art
of
living
,
who
would
see
one
through
.
What
with
one
thing
and
another
,
the
show
was
really
very
tolerable
;
and
he
would
sit
down
in
the
shade
and
smoke
.
There
was
Regent
's
Park
.
Yes
.
As
a
child
he
had
walked
in
Regent
's
Park
--
odd
,
he
thought
,
how
the
thought
of
childhood
keeps
coming
back
to
me
--
the
result
of
seeing
Clarissa
,
perhaps
;
for
women
live
much
more
in
the
past
than
we
do
,
he
thought
.
They
attach
themselves
to
places
;
and
their
fathers
--
a
woman
's
always
proud
of
her
father
.
Bourton
was
a
nice
place
,
a
very
nice
place
,
but
I
could
never
get
on
with
the
old
man
,
he
thought
.
There
was
quite
a
scene
one
night
--
an
argument
about
something
or
other
,
what
,
he
could
not
remember
.
Politics
presumably
.
Yes
,
he
remembered
Regent
's
Park
;
the
long
straight
walk
;
the
little
house
where
one
bought
air-balls
to
the
left
;
an
absurd
statue
with
an
inscription
somewhere
or
other
.
He
looked
for
an
empty
seat
.
He
did
not
want
to
be
bothered
(
feeling
a
little
drowsy
as
he
did
)
by
people
asking
him
the
time
.
An
elderly
grey
nurse
,
with
a
baby
asleep
in
its
perambulator
--
that
was
the
best
he
could
do
for
himself
;
sit
down
at
the
far
end
of
the
seat
by
that
nurse
.
She
's
a
queer-looking
girl
,
he
thought
,
suddenly
remembering
Elizabeth
as
she
came
into
the
room
and
stood
by
her
mother
.
Grown
big
;
quite
grown-up
,
not
exactly
pretty
;
handsome
rather
;
and
she
ca
n't
be
more
than
eighteen
.
Probably
she
does
n't
get
on
with
Clarissa
.
``
There
's
my
Elizabeth
''
--
that
sort
of
thing
--
why
not
``
Here
's
Elizabeth
''
simply
?
--
trying
to
make
out
,
like
most
mothers
,
that
things
are
what
they
're
not
.
She
trusts
to
her
charm
too
much
,
he
thought
.
She
overdoes
it
.
The
rich
benignant
cigar
smoke
eddied
coolly
down
his
throat
;
he
puffed
it
out
again
in
rings
which
breasted
the
air
bravely
for
a
moment
;
blue
,
circular
--
I
shall
try
and
get
a
word
alone
with
Elizabeth
to-night
,
he
thought
--
then
began
to
wobble
into
hour-glass
shapes
and
taper
away
;
odd
shapes
they
take
,
he
thought
.
Suddenly
he
closed
his
eyes
,
raised
his
hand
with
an
effort
,
and
threw
away
the
heavy
end
of
his
cigar
.
A
great
brush
swept
smooth
across
his
mind
,
sweeping
across
it
moving
branches
,
children
's
voices
,
the
shuffle
of
feet
,
and
people
passing
,
and
humming
traffic
,
rising
and
falling
traffic
.
Down
,
down
he
sank
into
the
plumes
and
feathers
of
sleep
,
sank
,
and
was
muffled
over
.
The
grey
nurse
resumed
her
knitting
as
Peter
Walsh
,
on
the
hot
seat
beside
her
,
began
snoring
.
In
her
grey
dress
,
moving
her
hands
indefatigably
yet
quietly
,
she
seemed
like
the
champion
of
the
rights
of
sleepers
,
like
one
of
those
spectral
presences
which
rise
in
twilight
in
woods
made
of
sky
and
branches
.
The
solitary
traveller
,
haunter
of
lanes
,
disturber
of
ferns
,
and
devastator
of
great
hemlock
plants
,
looking
up
,
suddenly
sees
the
giant
figure
at
the
end
of
the
ride
.
By
conviction
an
atheist
perhaps
,
he
is
taken
by
surprise
with
moments
of
extraordinary
exaltation
.
Nothing
exists
outside
us
except
a
state
of
mind
,
he
thinks
;
a
desire
for
solace
,
for
relief
,
for
something
outside
these
miserable
pigmies
,
these
feeble
,
these
ugly
,
these
craven
men
and
women
.
But
if
he
can
conceive
of
her
,
then
in
some
sort
she
exists
,
he
thinks
,
and
advancing
down
the
path
with
his
eyes
upon
sky
and
branches
he
rapidly
endows
them
with
womanhood
;
sees
with
amazement
how
grave
they
become
;
how
majestically
,
as
the
breeze
stirs
them
,
they
dispense
with
a
dark
flutter
of
the
leaves
charity
,
comprehension
,
absolution
,
and
then
,
flinging
themselves
suddenly
aloft
,
confound
the
piety
of
their
aspect
with
a
wild
carouse
.
Such
are
the
visions
which
proffer
great
cornucopias
full
of
fruit
to
the
solitary
traveller
,
or
murmur
in
his
ear
like
sirens
lolloping
away
on
the
green
sea
waves
,
or
are
dashed
in
his
face
like
bunches
of
roses
,
or
rise
to
the
surface
like
pale
faces
which
fishermen
flounder
through
floods
to
embrace
.
Such
are
the
visions
which
ceaselessly
float
up
,
pace
beside
,
put
their
faces
in
front
of
,
the
actual
thing
;
often
overpowering
the
solitary
traveller
and
taking
away
from
him
the
sense
of
the
earth
,
the
wish
to
return
,
and
giving
him
for
substitute
a
general
peace
,
as
if
(
so
he
thinks
as
he
advances
down
the
forest
ride
)
all
this
fever
of
living
were
simplicity
itself
;
and
myriads
of
things
merged
in
one
thing
;
and
this
figure
,
made
of
sky
and
branches
as
it
is
,
had
risen
from
the
troubled
sea
(
he
is
elderly
,
past
fifty
now
)
as
a
shape
might
be
sucked
up
out
of
the
waves
to
shower
down
from
her
magnificent
hands
compassion
,
comprehension
,
absolution
.
So
,
he
thinks
,
may
I
never
go
back
to
the
lamplight
;
to
the
sitting-room
;
never
finish
my
book
;
never
knock
out
my
pipe
;
never
ring
for
Mrs.
Turner
to
clear
away
;
rather
let
me
walk
straight
on
to
this
great
figure
,
who
will
,
with
a
toss
of
her
head
,
mount
me
on
her
streamers
and
let
me
blow
to
nothingness
with
the
rest
.
Such
are
the
visions
.
The
solitary
traveller
is
soon
beyond
the
wood
;
and
there
,
coming
to
the
door
with
shaded
eyes
,
possibly
to
look
for
his
return
,
with
hands
raised
,
with
white
apron
blowing
,
is
an
elderly
woman
who
seems
(
so
powerful
is
this
infirmity
)
to
seek
,
over
a
desert
,
a
lost
son
;
to
search
for
a
rider
destroyed
;
to
be
the
figure
of
the
mother
whose
sons
have
been
killed
in
the
battles
of
the
world
.
So
,
as
the
solitary
traveller
advances
down
the
village
street
where
the
women
stand
knitting
and
the
men
dig
in
the
garden
,
the
evening
seems
ominous
;
the
figures
still
;
as
if
some
august
fate
,
known
to
them
,
awaited
without
fear
,
were
about
to
sweep
them
into
complete
annihilation
.
Indoors
among
ordinary
things
,
the
cupboard
,
the
table
,
the
window-sill
with
its
geraniums
,
suddenly
the
outline
of
the
landlady
,
bending
to
remove
the
cloth
,
becomes
soft
with
light
,
an
adorable
emblem
which
only
the
recollection
of
cold
human
contacts
forbids
us
to
embrace
.
She
takes
the
marmalade
;
she
shuts
it
in
the
cupboard
.
``
There
is
nothing
more
to-night
,
sir
?
''
But
to
whom
does
the
solitary
traveller
make
reply
?
So
the
elderly
nurse
knitted
over
the
sleeping
baby
in
Regent
's
Park
.
So
Peter
Walsh
snored
.
He
woke
with
extreme
suddenness
,
saying
to
himself
,
``
The
death
of
the
soul
.
''
``
Lord
,
Lord
!
''
he
said
to
himself
out
loud
,
stretching
and
opening
his
eyes
.
``
The
death
of
the
soul
.
''
The
words
attached
themselves
to
some
scene
,
to
some
room
,
to
some
past
he
had
been
dreaming
of
.
It
became
clearer
;
the
scene
,
the
room
,
the
past
he
had
been
dreaming
of
.
It
was
at
Bourton
that
summer
,
early
in
the
'nineties
,
when
he
was
so
passionately
in
love
with
Clarissa
.
There
were
a
great
many
people
there
,
laughing
and
talking
,
sitting
round
a
table
after
tea
and
the
room
was
bathed
in
yellow
light
and
full
of
cigarette
smoke
.
They
were
talking
about
a
man
who
had
married
his
housemaid
,
one
of
the
neighbouring
squires
,
he
had
forgotten
his
name
.
He
had
married
his
housemaid
,
and
she
had
been
brought
to
Bourton
to
call
--
an
awful
visit
it
had
been
.
She
was
absurdly
over-dressed
,
``
like
a
cockatoo
,
''
Clarissa
had
said
,
imitating
her
,
and
she
never
stopped
talking
.
On
and
on
she
went
,
on
and
on
.
Clarissa
imitated
her
.
Then
somebody
said
--
Sally
Seton
it
was
--
did
it
make
any
real
difference
to
one
's
feelings
to
know
that
before
they
'd
married
she
had
had
a
baby
?
(
In
those
days
,
in
mixed
company
,
it
was
a
bold
thing
to
say
.
)
He
could
see
Clarissa
now
,
turning
bright
pink
;
somehow
contracting
;
and
saying
,
``
Oh
,
I
shall
never
be
able
to
speak
to
her
again
!
''
Whereupon
the
whole
party
sitting
round
the
tea-table
seemed
to
wobble
.
It
was
very
uncomfortable
.
He
had
n't
blamed
her
for
minding
the
fact
,
since
in
those
days
a
girl
brought
up
as
she
was
,
knew
nothing
,
but
it
was
her
manner
that
annoyed
him
;
timid
;
hard
;
something
arrogant
;
unimaginative
;
prudish
.
``
The
death
of
the
soul
.
''
He
had
said
that
instinctively
,
ticketing
the
moment
as
he
used
to
do
--
the
death
of
her
soul
.
Every
one
wobbled
;
every
one
seemed
to
bow
,
as
she
spoke
,
and
then
to
stand
up
different
.
He
could
see
Sally
Seton
,
like
a
child
who
has
been
in
mischief
,
leaning
forward
,
rather
flushed
,
wanting
to
talk
,
but
afraid
,
and
Clarissa
did
frighten
people
.
(
She
was
Clarissa
's
greatest
friend
,
always
about
the
place
,
totally
unlike
her
,
an
attractive
creature
,
handsome
,
dark
,
with
the
reputation
in
those
days
of
great
daring
and
he
used
to
give
her
cigars
,
which
she
smoked
in
her
bedroom
.
She
had
either
been
engaged
to
somebody
or
quarrelled
with
her
family
and
old
Parry
disliked
them
both
equally
,
which
was
a
great
bond
.
)
Then
Clarissa
,
still
with
an
air
of
being
offended
with
them
all
,
got
up
,
made
some
excuse
,
and
went
off
,
alone
.
As
she
opened
the
door
,
in
came
that
great
shaggy
dog
which
ran
after
sheep
.
She
flung
herself
upon
him
,
went
into
raptures
.
It
was
as
if
she
said
to
Peter
--
it
was
all
aimed
at
him
,
he
knew
--
''
I
know
you
thought
me
absurd
about
that
woman
just
now
;
but
see
how
extraordinarily
sympathetic
I
am
;
see
how
I
love
my
Rob
!
''
They
had
always
this
queer
power
of
communicating
without
words
.
She
knew
directly
he
criticised
her
.
Then
she
would
do
something
quite
obvious
to
defend
herself
,
like
this
fuss
with
the
dog
--
but
it
never
took
him
in
,
he
always
saw
through
Clarissa
.
Not
that
he
said
anything
,
of
course
;
just
sat
looking
glum
.
It
was
the
way
their
quarrels
often
began
.
She
shut
the
door
.
At
once
he
became
extremely
depressed
.
It
all
seemed
useless
--
going
on
being
in
love
;
going
on
quarrelling
;
going
on
making
it
up
,
and
he
wandered
off
alone
,
among
outhouses
,
stables
,
looking
at
the
horses
.
(
The
place
was
quite
a
humble
one
;
the
Parrys
were
never
very
well
off
;
but
there
were
always
grooms
and
stable-boys
about
--
Clarissa
loved
riding
--
and
an
old
coachman
--
what
was
his
name
?
--
an
old
nurse
,
old
Moody
,
old
Goody
,
some
such
name
they
called
her
,
whom
one
was
taken
to
visit
in
a
little
room
with
lots
of
photographs
,
lots
of
bird-cages
.
)
It
was
an
awful
evening
!
He
grew
more
and
more
gloomy
,
not
about
that
only
;
about
everything
.
And
he
could
n't
see
her
;
could
n't
explain
to
her
;
could
n't
have
it
out
.
There
were
always
people
about
--
she
'd
go
on
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
That
was
the
devilish
part
of
her
--
this
coldness
,
this
woodenness
,
something
very
profound
in
her
,
which
he
had
felt
again
this
morning
talking
to
her
;
an
impenetrability
.
Yet
Heaven
knows
he
loved
her
.
She
had
some
queer
power
of
fiddling
on
one
's
nerves
,
turning
one
's
nerves
to
fiddle-strings
,
yes
.
He
had
gone
in
to
dinner
rather
late
,
from
some
idiotic
idea
of
making
himself
felt
,
and
had
sat
down
by
old
Miss
Parry
--
Aunt
Helena
--
Mr.
Parry
's
sister
,
who
was
supposed
to
preside
.
There
she
sat
in
her
white
Cashmere
shawl
,
with
her
head
against
the
window
--
a
formidable
old
lady
,
but
kind
to
him
,
for
he
had
found
her
some
rare
flower
,
and
she
was
a
great
botanist
,
marching
off
in
thick
boots
with
a
black
collecting-box
slung
between
her
shoulders
.
He
sat
down
beside
her
,
and
could
n't
speak
.
Everything
seemed
to
race
past
him
;
he
just
sat
there
,
eating
.
And
then
half-way
through
dinner
he
made
himself
look
across
at
Clarissa
for
the
first
time
.
She
was
talking
to
a
young
man
on
her
right
.
He
had
a
sudden
revelation
.
``
She
will
marry
that
man
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
He
did
n't
even
know
his
name
.
For
of
course
it
was
that
afternoon
,
that
very
afternoon
,
that
Dalloway
had
come
over
;
and
Clarissa
called
him
``
Wickham
''
;
that
was
the
beginning
of
it
all
.
Somebody
had
brought
him
over
;
and
Clarissa
got
his
name
wrong
.
She
introduced
him
to
everybody
as
Wickham
.
At
last
he
said
``
My
name
is
Dalloway
!
''
--
that
was
his
first
view
of
Richard
--
a
fair
young
man
,
rather
awkward
,
sitting
on
a
deck-chair
,
and
blurting
out
``
My
name
is
Dalloway
!
''
Sally
got
hold
of
it
;
always
after
that
she
called
him
``
My
name
is
Dalloway
!
''
He
was
a
prey
to
revelations
at
that
time
.
This
one
--
that
she
would
marry
Dalloway
--
was
blinding
--
overwhelming
at
the
moment
.
There
was
a
sort
of
--
how
could
he
put
it
?
--
a
sort
of
ease
in
her
manner
to
him
;
something
maternal
;
something
gentle
.
They
were
talking
about
politics
.
All
through
dinner
he
tried
to
hear
what
they
were
saying
.
Afterwards
he
could
remember
standing
by
old
Miss
Parry
's
chair
in
the
drawing-room
.
Clarissa
came
up
,
with
her
perfect
manners
,
like
a
real
hostess
,
and
wanted
to
introduce
him
to
some
one
--
spoke
as
if
they
had
never
met
before
,
which
enraged
him
.
Yet
even
then
he
admired
her
for
it
.
He
admired
her
courage
;
her
social
instinct
;
he
admired
her
power
of
carrying
things
through
.
``
The
perfect
hostess
,
''
he
said
to
her
,
whereupon
she
winced
all
over
.
But
he
meant
her
to
feel
it
.
He
would
have
done
anything
to
hurt
her
after
seeing
her
with
Dalloway
.
So
she
left
him
.
And
he
had
a
feeling
that
they
were
all
gathered
together
in
a
conspiracy
against
him
--
laughing
and
talking
--
behind
his
back
.
There
he
stood
by
Miss
Parry
's
chair
as
though
he
had
been
cut
out
of
wood
,
he
talking
about
wild
flowers
.
Never
,
never
had
he
suffered
so
infernally
!
He
must
have
forgotten
even
to
pretend
to
listen
;
at
last
he
woke
up
;
he
saw
Miss
Parry
looking
rather
disturbed
,
rather
indignant
,
with
her
prominent
eyes
fixed
.
He
almost
cried
out
that
he
could
n't
attend
because
he
was
in
Hell
!
People
began
going
out
of
the
room
.
He
heard
them
talking
about
fetching
cloaks
;
about
its
being
cold
on
the
water
,
and
so
on
.
They
were
going
boating
on
the
lake
by
moonlight
--
one
of
Sally
's
mad
ideas
.
He
could
hear
her
describing
the
moon
.
And
they
all
went
out
.
He
was
left
quite
alone
.
``
Do
n't
you
want
to
go
with
them
?
''
said
Aunt
Helena
--
old
Miss
Parry
!
--
she
had
guessed
.
And
he
turned
round
and
there
was
Clarissa
again
.
She
had
come
back
to
fetch
him
.
He
was
overcome
by
her
generosity
--
her
goodness
.
``
Come
along
,
''
she
said
.
``
They
're
waiting
.
''
He
had
never
felt
so
happy
in
the
whole
of
his
life
!
Without
a
word
they
made
it
up
.
They
walked
down
to
the
lake
.
He
had
twenty
minutes
of
perfect
happiness
.
Her
voice
,
her
laugh
,
her
dress
(
something
floating
,
white
,
crimson
)
,
her
spirit
,
her
adventurousness
;
she
made
them
all
disembark
and
explore
the
island
;
she
startled
a
hen
;
she
laughed
;
she
sang
.
And
all
the
time
,
he
knew
perfectly
well
,
Dalloway
was
falling
in
love
with
her
;
she
was
falling
in
love
with
Dalloway
;
but
it
did
n't
seem
to
matter
.
Nothing
mattered
.
They
sat
on
the
ground
and
talked
--
he
and
Clarissa
.
They
went
in
and
out
of
each
other
's
minds
without
any
effort
.
And
then
in
a
second
it
was
over
.
He
said
to
himself
as
they
were
getting
into
the
boat
,
``
She
will
marry
that
man
,
''
dully
,
without
any
resentment
;
but
it
was
an
obvious
thing
.
Dalloway
would
marry
Clarissa
.
Dalloway
rowed
them
in
.
He
said
nothing
.
But
somehow
as
they
watched
him
start
,
jumping
on
to
his
bicycle
to
ride
twenty
miles
through
the
woods
,
wobbling
off
down
the
drive
,
waving
his
hand
and
disappearing
,
he
obviously
did
feel
,
instinctively
,
tremendously
,
strongly
,
all
that
;
the
night
;
the
romance
;
Clarissa
.
He
deserved
to
have
her
.
For
himself
,
he
was
absurd
.
His
demands
upon
Clarissa
(
he
could
see
it
now
)
were
absurd
.
He
asked
impossible
things
.
He
made
terrible
scenes
.
She
would
have
accepted
him
still
,
perhaps
,
if
he
had
been
less
absurd
.
Sally
thought
so
.
She
wrote
him
all
that
summer
long
letters
;
how
they
had
talked
of
him
;
how
she
had
praised
him
,
how
Clarissa
burst
into
tears
!
It
was
an
extraordinary
summer
--
all
letters
,
scenes
,
telegrams
--
arriving
at
Bourton
early
in
the
morning
,
hanging
about
till
the
servants
were
up
;
appalling
tête-à-têtes
with
old
Mr.
Parry
at
breakfast
;
Aunt
Helena
formidable
but
kind
;
Sally
sweeping
him
off
for
talks
in
the
vegetable
garden
;
Clarissa
in
bed
with
headaches
.
The
final
scene
,
the
terrible
scene
which
he
believed
had
mattered
more
than
anything
in
the
whole
of
his
life
(
it
might
be
an
exaggeration
--
but
still
so
it
did
seem
now
)
happened
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
of
a
very
hot
day
.
It
was
a
trifle
that
led
up
to
it
--
Sally
at
lunch
saying
something
about
Dalloway
,
and
calling
him
``
My
name
is
Dalloway
''
;
whereupon
Clarissa
suddenly
stiffened
,
coloured
,
in
a
way
she
had
,
and
rapped
out
sharply
,
``
We
've
had
enough
of
that
feeble
joke
.
''
That
was
all
;
but
for
him
it
was
precisely
as
if
she
had
said
,
``
I
'm
only
amusing
myself
with
you
;
I
've
an
understanding
with
Richard
Dalloway
.
''
So
he
took
it
.
He
had
not
slept
for
nights
.
``
It
's
got
to
be
finished
one
way
or
the
other
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
He
sent
a
note
to
her
by
Sally
asking
her
to
meet
him
by
the
fountain
at
three
.
``
Something
very
important
has
happened
,
''
he
scribbled
at
the
end
of
it
.
The
fountain
was
in
the
middle
of
a
little
shrubbery
,
far
from
the
house
,
with
shrubs
and
trees
all
round
it
.
There
she
came
,
even
before
the
time
,
and
they
stood
with
the
fountain
between
them
,
the
spout
(
it
was
broken
)
dribbling
water
incessantly
.
How
sights
fix
themselves
upon
the
mind
!
For
example
,
the
vivid
green
moss
.
She
did
not
move
.
``
Tell
me
the
truth
,
tell
me
the
truth
,
''
he
kept
on
saying
.
He
felt
as
if
his
forehead
would
burst
.
She
seemed
contracted
,
petrified
.
She
did
not
move
.
``
Tell
me
the
truth
,
''
he
repeated
,
when
suddenly
that
old
man
Breitkopf
popped
his
head
in
carrying
the
Times
;
stared
at
them
;
gaped
;
and
went
away
.
They
neither
of
them
moved
.
``
Tell
me
the
truth
,
''
he
repeated
.
He
felt
that
he
was
grinding
against
something
physically
hard
;
she
was
unyielding
.
She
was
like
iron
,
like
flint
,
rigid
up
the
backbone
.
And
when
she
said
,
``
It
's
no
use
.
It
's
no
use
.
This
is
the
end
''
--
after
he
had
spoken
for
hours
,
it
seemed
,
with
the
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
--
it
was
as
if
she
had
hit
him
in
the
face
.
She
turned
,
she
left
him
,
went
away
.
``
Clarissa
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Clarissa
!
''
But
she
never
came
back
.
It
was
over
.
He
went
away
that
night
.
He
never
saw
her
again
.
It
was
awful
,
he
cried
,
awful
,
awful
!
Still
,
the
sun
was
hot
.
Still
,
one
got
over
things
.
Still
,
life
had
a
way
of
adding
day
to
day
.
Still
,
he
thought
,
yawning
and
beginning
to
take
notice
--
Regent
's
Park
had
changed
very
little
since
he
was
a
boy
,
except
for
the
squirrels
--
still
,
presumably
there
were
compensations
--
when
little
Elise
Mitchell
,
who
had
been
picking
up
pebbles
to
add
to
the
pebble
collection
which
she
and
her
brother
were
making
on
the
nursery
mantelpiece
,
plumped
her
handful
down
on
the
nurse
's
knee
and
scudded
off
again
full
tilt
into
a
lady
's
legs
.
Peter
Walsh
laughed
out
.
But
Lucrezia
Warren
Smith
was
saying
to
herself
,
It
's
wicked
;
why
should
I
suffer
?
she
was
asking
,
as
she
walked
down
the
broad
path
.
No
;
I
ca
n't
stand
it
any
longer
,
she
was
saying
,
having
left
Septimus
,
who
was
n't
Septimus
any
longer
,
to
say
hard
,
cruel
,
wicked
things
,
to
talk
to
himself
,
to
talk
to
a
dead
man
,
on
the
seat
over
there
;
when
the
child
ran
full
tilt
into
her
,
fell
flat
,
and
burst
out
crying
.
That
was
comforting
rather
.
She
stood
her
upright
,
dusted
her
frock
,
kissed
her
.
But
for
herself
she
had
done
nothing
wrong
;
she
had
loved
Septimus
;
she
had
been
happy
;
she
had
had
a
beautiful
home
,
and
there
her
sisters
lived
still
,
making
hats
.
Why
should
she
suffer
?
The
child
ran
straight
back
to
its
nurse
,
and
Rezia
saw
her
scolded
,
comforted
,
taken
up
by
the
nurse
who
put
down
her
knitting
,
and
the
kind-looking
man
gave
her
his
watch
to
blow
open
to
comfort
her
--
but
why
should
she
be
exposed
?
Why
not
left
in
Milan
?
Why
tortured
?
Why
?
Slightly
waved
by
tears
the
broad
path
,
the
nurse
,
the
man
in
grey
,
the
perambulator
,
rose
and
fell
before
her
eyes
.
To
be
rocked
by
this
malignant
torturer
was
her
lot
.
But
why
?
She
was
like
a
bird
sheltering
under
the
thin
hollow
of
a
leaf
,
who
blinks
at
the
sun
when
the
leaf
moves
;
starts
at
the
crack
of
a
dry
twig
.
She
was
exposed
;
she
was
surrounded
by
the
enormous
trees
,
vast
clouds
of
an
indifferent
world
,
exposed
;
tortured
;
and
why
should
she
suffer
?
Why
?
She
frowned
;
she
stamped
her
foot
.
She
must
go
back
again
to
Septimus
since
it
was
almost
time
for
them
to
be
going
to
Sir
William
Bradshaw
.
She
must
go
back
and
tell
him
,
go
back
to
him
sitting
there
on
the
green
chair
under
the
tree
,
talking
to
himself
,
or
to
that
dead
man
Evans
,
whom
she
had
only
seen
once
for
a
moment
in
the
shop
.
He
had
seemed
a
nice
quiet
man
;
a
great
friend
of
Septimus
's
,
and
he
had
been
killed
in
the
War
.
But
such
things
happen
to
every
one
.
Every
one
has
friends
who
were
killed
in
the
War
.
Every
one
gives
up
something
when
they
marry
.
She
had
given
up
her
home
.
She
had
come
to
live
here
,
in
this
awful
city
.
But
Septimus
let
himself
think
about
horrible
things
,
as
she
could
too
,
if
she
tried
.
He
had
grown
stranger
and
stranger
.
He
said
people
were
talking
behind
the
bedroom
walls
.
Mrs.
Filmer
thought
it
odd
.
He
saw
things
too
--
he
had
seen
an
old
woman
's
head
in
the
middle
of
a
fern
.
Yet
he
could
be
happy
when
he
chose
.
They
went
to
Hampton
Court
on
top
of
a
bus
,
and
they
were
perfectly
happy
.
All
the
little
red
and
yellow
flowers
were
out
on
the
grass
,
like
floating
lamps
he
said
,
and
talked
and
chattered
and
laughed
,
making
up
stories
.
Suddenly
he
said
,
``
Now
we
will
kill
ourselves
,
''
when
they
were
standing
by
the
river
,
and
he
looked
at
it
with
a
look
which
she
had
seen
in
his
eyes
when
a
train
went
by
,
or
an
omnibus
--
a
look
as
if
something
fascinated
him
;
and
she
felt
he
was
going
from
her
and
she
caught
him
by
the
arm
.
But
going
home
he
was
perfectly
quiet
--
perfectly
reasonable
.
He
would
argue
with
her
about
killing
themselves
;
and
explain
how
wicked
people
were
;
how
he
could
see
them
making
up
lies
as
they
passed
in
the
street
.
He
knew
all
their
thoughts
,
he
said
;
he
knew
everything
.
He
knew
the
meaning
of
the
world
,
he
said
.
Then
when
they
got
back
he
could
hardly
walk
.
He
lay
on
the
sofa
and
made
her
hold
his
hand
to
prevent
him
from
falling
down
,
down
,
he
cried
,
into
the
flames
!
and
saw
faces
laughing
at
him
,
calling
him
horrible
disgusting
names
,
from
the
walls
,
and
hands
pointing
round
the
screen
.
Yet
they
were
quite
alone
.
But
he
began
to
talk
aloud
,
answering
people
,
arguing
,
laughing
,
crying
,
getting
very
excited
and
making
her
write
things
down
.
Perfect
nonsense
it
was
;
about
death
;
about
Miss
Isabel
Pole
.
She
could
stand
it
no
longer
.
She
would
go
back
.
She
was
close
to
him
now
,
could
see
him
staring
at
the
sky
,
muttering
,
clasping
his
hands
.
Yet
Dr.
Holmes
said
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
him
.
What
then
had
happened
--
why
had
he
gone
,
then
,
why
,
when
she
sat
by
him
,
did
he
start
,
frown
at
her
,
move
away
,
and
point
at
her
hand
,
take
her
hand
,
look
at
it
terrified
?
Was
it
that
she
had
taken
off
her
wedding
ring
?
``
My
hand
has
grown
so
thin
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
have
put
it
in
my
purse
,
''
she
told
him
.
He
dropped
her
hand
.
Their
marriage
was
over
,
he
thought
,
with
agony
,
with
relief
.
The
rope
was
cut
;
he
mounted
;
he
was
free
,
as
it
was
decreed
that
he
,
Septimus
,
the
lord
of
men
,
should
be
free
;
alone
(
since
his
wife
had
thrown
away
her
wedding
ring
;
since
she
had
left
him
)
,
he
,
Septimus
,
was
alone
,
called
forth
in
advance
of
the
mass
of
men
to
hear
the
truth
,
to
learn
the
meaning
,
which
now
at
last
,
after
all
the
toils
of
civilisation
--
Greeks
,
Romans
,
Shakespeare
,
Darwin
,
and
now
himself
--
was
to
be
given
whole
to
.
.
.
.
``
To
whom
?
''
he
asked
aloud
.
``
To
the
Prime
Minister
,
''
the
voices
which
rustled
above
his
head
replied
.
The
supreme
secret
must
be
told
to
the
Cabinet
;
first
that
trees
are
alive
;
next
there
is
no
crime
;
next
love
,
universal
love
,
he
muttered
,
gasping
,
trembling
,
painfully
drawing
out
these
profound
truths
which
needed
,
so
deep
were
they
,
so
difficult
,
an
immense
effort
to
speak
out
,
but
the
world
was
entirely
changed
by
them
for
ever
.
No
crime
;
love
;
he
repeated
,
fumbling
for
his
card
and
pencil
,
when
a
Skye
terrier
snuffed
his
trousers
and
he
started
in
an
agony
of
fear
.
It
was
turning
into
a
man
!
He
could
not
watch
it
happen
!
It
was
horrible
,
terrible
to
see
a
dog
become
a
man
!
At
once
the
dog
trotted
away
.
Heaven
was
divinely
merciful
,
infinitely
benignant
.
It
spared
him
,
pardoned
his
weakness
.
But
what
was
the
scientific
explanation
(
for
one
must
be
scientific
above
all
things
)
?
Why
could
he
see
through
bodies
,
see
into
the
future
,
when
dogs
will
become
men
?
It
was
the
heat
wave
presumably
,
operating
upon
a
brain
made
sensitive
by
eons
of
evolution
.
Scientifically
speaking
,
the
flesh
was
melted
off
the
world
.
His
body
was
macerated
until
only
the
nerve
fibres
were
left
.
It
was
spread
like
a
veil
upon
a
rock
.
He
lay
back
in
his
chair
,
exhausted
but
upheld
.
He
lay
resting
,
waiting
,
before
he
again
interpreted
,
with
effort
,
with
agony
,
to
mankind
.
He
lay
very
high
,
on
the
back
of
the
world
.
The
earth
thrilled
beneath
him
.
Red
flowers
grew
through
his
flesh
;
their
stiff
leaves
rustled
by
his
head
.
Music
began
clanging
against
the
rocks
up
here
.
It
is
a
motor
horn
down
in
the
street
,
he
muttered
;
but
up
here
it
cannoned
from
rock
to
rock
,
divided
,
met
in
shocks
of
sound
which
rose
in
smooth
columns
(
that
music
should
be
visible
was
a
discovery
)
and
became
an
anthem
,
an
anthem
twined
round
now
by
a
shepherd
boy
's
piping
(
That
's
an
old
man
playing
a
penny
whistle
by
the
public-house
,
he
muttered
)
which
,
as
the
boy
stood
still
came
bubbling
from
his
pipe
,
and
then
,
as
he
climbed
higher
,
made
its
exquisite
plaint
while
the
traffic
passed
beneath
.
This
boy
's
elegy
is
played
among
the
traffic
,
thought
Septimus
.
Now
he
withdraws
up
into
the
snows
,
and
roses
hang
about
him
--
the
thick
red
roses
which
grow
on
my
bedroom
wall
,
he
reminded
himself
.
The
music
stopped
.
He
has
his
penny
,
he
reasoned
it
out
,
and
has
gone
on
to
the
next
public-house
.
But
he
himself
remained
high
on
his
rock
,
like
a
drowned
sailor
on
a
rock
.
I
leant
over
the
edge
of
the
boat
and
fell
down
,
he
thought
.
I
went
under
the
sea
.
I
have
been
dead
,
and
yet
am
now
alive
,
but
let
me
rest
still
;
he
begged
(
he
was
talking
to
himself
again
--
it
was
awful
,
awful
!
)
;
and
as
,
before
waking
,
the
voices
of
birds
and
the
sound
of
wheels
chime
and
chatter
in
a
queer
harmony
,
grow
louder
and
louder
and
the
sleeper
feels
himself
drawing
to
the
shores
of
life
,
so
he
felt
himself
drawing
towards
life
,
the
sun
growing
hotter
,
cries
sounding
louder
,
something
tremendous
about
to
happen
.
He
had
only
to
open
his
eyes
;
but
a
weight
was
on
them
;
a
fear
.
He
strained
;
he
pushed
;
he
looked
;
he
saw
Regent
's
Park
before
him
.
Long
streamers
of
sunlight
fawned
at
his
feet
.
The
trees
waved
,
brandished
.
We
welcome
,
the
world
seemed
to
say
;
we
accept
;
we
create
.
Beauty
,
the
world
seemed
to
say
.
And
as
if
to
prove
it
(
scientifically
)
wherever
he
looked
at
the
houses
,
at
the
railings
,
at
the
antelopes
stretching
over
the
palings
,
beauty
sprang
instantly
.
To
watch
a
leaf
quivering
in
the
rush
of
air
was
an
exquisite
joy
.
Up
in
the
sky
swallows
swooping
,
swerving
,
flinging
themselves
in
and
out
,
round
and
round
,
yet
always
with
perfect
control
as
if
elastics
held
them
;
and
the
flies
rising
and
falling
;
and
the
sun
spotting
now
this
leaf
,
now
that
,
in
mockery
,
dazzling
it
with
soft
gold
in
pure
good
temper
;
and
now
and
again
some
chime
(
it
might
be
a
motor
horn
)
tinkling
divinely
on
the
grass
stalks
--
all
of
this
,
calm
and
reasonable
as
it
was
,
made
out
of
ordinary
things
as
it
was
,
was
the
truth
now
;
beauty
,
that
was
the
truth
now
.
Beauty
was
everywhere
.

It
is
time
,
''
said
Rezia
.
The
word
``
time
''
split
its
husk
;
poured
its
riches
over
him
;
and
from
his
lips
fell
like
shells
,
like
shavings
from
a
plane
,
without
his
making
them
,
hard
,
white
,
imperishable
words
,
and
flew
to
attach
themselves
to
their
places
in
an
ode
to
Time
;
an
immortal
ode
to
Time
.
He
sang
.
Evans
answered
from
behind
the
tree
.
The
dead
were
in
Thessaly
,
Evans
sang
,
among
the
orchids
.
There
they
waited
till
the
War
was
over
,
and
now
the
dead
,
now
Evans
himself
--
``
For
God
's
sake
do
n't
come
!
''
Septimus
cried
out
.
For
he
could
not
look
upon
the
dead
.
But
the
branches
parted
.
A
man
in
grey
was
actually
walking
towards
them
.
It
was
Evans
!
But
no
mud
was
on
him
;
no
wounds
;
he
was
not
changed
.
I
must
tell
the
whole
world
,
Septimus
cried
,
raising
his
hand
(
as
the
dead
man
in
the
grey
suit
came
nearer
)
,
raising
his
hand
like
some
colossal
figure
who
has
lamented
the
fate
of
man
for
ages
in
the
desert
alone
with
his
hands
pressed
to
his
forehead
,
furrows
of
despair
on
his
cheeks
,
and
now
sees
light
on
the
desert
's
edge
which
broadens
and
strikes
the
iron-black
figure
(
and
Septimus
half
rose
from
his
chair
)
,
and
with
legions
of
men
prostrate
behind
him
he
,
the
giant
mourner
,
receives
for
one
moment
on
his
face
the
whole
--
``
But
I
am
so
unhappy
,
Septimus
,
''
said
Rezia
trying
to
make
him
sit
down
.
The
millions
lamented
;
for
ages
they
had
sorrowed
.
He
would
turn
round
,
he
would
tell
them
in
a
few
moments
,
only
a
few
moments
more
,
of
this
relief
,
of
this
joy
,
of
this
astonishing
revelation
--
``
The
time
,
Septimus
,
''
Rezia
repeated
.
``
What
is
the
time
?
''
He
was
talking
,
he
was
starting
,
this
man
must
notice
him
.
He
was
looking
at
them
.
``
I
will
tell
you
the
time
,
''
said
Septimus
,
very
slowly
,
very
drowsily
,
smiling
mysteriously
.
As
he
sat
smiling
at
the
dead
man
in
the
grey
suit
the
quarter
struck
--
the
quarter
to
twelve
.
And
that
is
being
young
,
Peter
Walsh
thought
as
he
passed
them
.
To
be
having
an
awful
scene
--
the
poor
girl
looked
absolutely
desperate
--
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
.
But
what
was
it
about
,
he
wondered
,
what
had
the
young
man
in
the
overcoat
been
saying
to
her
to
make
her
look
like
that
;
what
awful
fix
had
they
got
themselves
into
,
both
to
look
so
desperate
as
that
on
a
fine
summer
morning
?
The
amusing
thing
about
coming
back
to
England
,
after
five
years
,
was
the
way
it
made
,
anyhow
the
first
days
,
things
stand
out
as
if
one
had
never
seen
them
before
;
lovers
squabbling
under
a
tree
;
the
domestic
family
life
of
the
parks
.
Never
had
he
seen
London
look
so
enchanting
--
the
softness
of
the
distances
;
the
richness
;
the
greenness
;
the
civilisation
,
after
India
,
he
thought
,
strolling
across
the
grass
.
This
susceptibility
to
impressions
had
been
his
undoing
no
doubt
.
Still
at
his
age
he
had
,
like
a
boy
or
a
girl
even
,
these
alternations
of
mood
;
good
days
,
bad
days
,
for
no
reason
whatever
,
happiness
from
a
pretty
face
,
downright
misery
at
the
sight
of
a
frump
.
After
India
of
course
one
fell
in
love
with
every
woman
one
met
.
There
was
a
freshness
about
them
;
even
the
poorest
dressed
better
than
five
years
ago
surely
;
and
to
his
eye
the
fashions
had
never
been
so
becoming
;
the
long
black
cloaks
;
the
slimness
;
the
elegance
;
and
then
the
delicious
and
apparently
universal
habit
of
paint
.
Every
woman
,
even
the
most
respectable
,
had
roses
blooming
under
glass
;
lips
cut
with
a
knife
;
curls
of
Indian
ink
;
there
was
design
,
art
,
everywhere
;
a
change
of
some
sort
had
undoubtedly
taken
place
.
What
did
the
young
people
think
about
?
Peter
Walsh
asked
himself
.
Those
five
years
--
1918
to
1923
--
had
been
,
he
suspected
,
somehow
very
important
.
People
looked
different
.
Newspapers
seemed
different
.
Now
for
instance
there
was
a
man
writing
quite
openly
in
one
of
the
respectable
weeklies
about
water-closets
.
That
you
could
n't
have
done
ten
years
ago
--
written
quite
openly
about
water-closets
in
a
respectable
weekly
.
And
then
this
taking
out
a
stick
of
rouge
,
or
a
powder-puff
and
making
up
in
public
.
On
board
ship
coming
home
there
were
lots
of
young
men
and
girls
--
Betty
and
Bertie
he
remembered
in
particular
--
carrying
on
quite
openly
;
the
old
mother
sitting
and
watching
them
with
her
knitting
,
cool
as
a
cucumber
.
The
girl
would
stand
still
and
powder
her
nose
in
front
of
every
one
.
And
they
were
n't
engaged
;
just
having
a
good
time
;
no
feelings
hurt
on
either
side
.
As
hard
as
nails
she
was
--
Betty
What'shername
--
;
but
a
thorough
good
sort
.
She
would
make
a
very
good
wife
at
thirty
--
she
would
marry
when
it
suited
her
to
marry
;
marry
some
rich
man
and
live
in
a
large
house
near
Manchester
.
Who
was
it
now
who
had
done
that
?
Peter
Walsh
asked
himself
,
turning
into
the
Broad
Walk
,
--
married
a
rich
man
and
lived
in
a
large
house
near
Manchester
?
Somebody
who
had
written
him
a
long
,
gushing
letter
quite
lately
about
``
blue
hydrangeas
.
''
It
was
seeing
blue
hydrangeas
that
made
her
think
of
him
and
the
old
days
--
Sally
Seton
,
of
course
!
It
was
Sally
Seton
--
the
last
person
in
the
world
one
would
have
expected
to
marry
a
rich
man
and
live
in
a
large
house
near
Manchester
,
the
wild
,
the
daring
,
the
romantic
Sally
!
But
of
all
that
ancient
lot
,
Clarissa
's
friends
--
Whitbreads
,
Kinderleys
,
Cunninghams
,
Kinloch-Jones
's
--
Sally
was
probably
the
best
.
She
tried
to
get
hold
of
things
by
the
right
end
anyhow
.
She
saw
through
Hugh
Whitbread
anyhow
--
the
admirable
Hugh
--
when
Clarissa
and
the
rest
were
at
his
feet
.
``
The
Whitbreads
?
''
he
could
hear
her
saying
.
``
Who
are
the
Whitbreads
?
Coal
merchants
.
Respectable
tradespeople
.
''
Hugh
she
detested
for
some
reason
.
He
thought
of
nothing
but
his
own
appearance
,
she
said
.
He
ought
to
have
been
a
Duke
.
He
would
be
certain
to
marry
one
of
the
Royal
Princesses
.
And
of
course
Hugh
had
the
most
extraordinary
,
the
most
natural
,
the
most
sublime
respect
for
the
British
aristocracy
of
any
human
being
he
had
ever
come
across
.
Even
Clarissa
had
to
own
that
.
Oh
,
but
he
was
such
a
dear
,
so
unselfish
,
gave
up
shooting
to
please
his
old
mother
--
remembered
his
aunts
'
birthdays
,
and
so
on
.
Sally
,
to
do
her
justice
,
saw
through
all
that
.
One
of
the
things
he
remembered
best
was
an
argument
one
Sunday
morning
at
Bourton
about
women
's
rights
(
that
antediluvian
topic
)
,
when
Sally
suddenly
lost
her
temper
,
flared
up
,
and
told
Hugh
that
he
represented
all
that
was
most
detestable
in
British
middle-class
life
.
She
told
him
that
she
considered
him
responsible
for
the
state
of
``
those
poor
girls
in
Piccadilly
''
--
Hugh
,
the
perfect
gentleman
,
poor
Hugh
!
--
never
did
a
man
look
more
horrified
!
She
did
it
on
purpose
she
said
afterwards
(
for
they
used
to
get
together
in
the
vegetable
garden
and
compare
notes
)
.
``
He
's
read
nothing
,
thought
nothing
,
felt
nothing
,
''
he
could
hear
her
saying
in
that
very
emphatic
voice
which
carried
so
much
farther
than
she
knew
.
The
stable
boys
had
more
life
in
them
than
Hugh
,
she
said
.
He
was
a
perfect
specimen
of
the
public
school
type
,
she
said
.
No
country
but
England
could
have
produced
him
.
She
was
really
spiteful
,
for
some
reason
;
had
some
grudge
against
him
.
Something
had
happened
--
he
forgot
what
--
in
the
smoking-room
.
He
had
insulted
her
--
kissed
her
?
Incredible
!
Nobody
believed
a
word
against
Hugh
of
course
.
Who
could
?
Kissing
Sally
in
the
smoking-room
!
If
it
had
been
some
Honourable
Edith
or
Lady
Violet
,
perhaps
;
but
not
that
ragamuffin
Sally
without
a
penny
to
her
name
,
and
a
father
or
a
mother
gambling
at
Monte
Carlo
.
For
of
all
the
people
he
had
ever
met
Hugh
was
the
greatest
snob
--
the
most
obsequious
--
no
,
he
did
n't
cringe
exactly
.
He
was
too
much
of
a
prig
for
that
.
A
first-rate
valet
was
the
obvious
comparison
--
somebody
who
walked
behind
carrying
suit
cases
;
could
be
trusted
to
send
telegrams
--
indispensable
to
hostesses
.
And
he
'd
found
his
job
--
married
his
Honourable
Evelyn
;
got
some
little
post
at
Court
,
looked
after
the
King
's
cellars
,
polished
the
Imperial
shoe-buckles
,
went
about
in
knee-breeches
and
lace
ruffles
.
How
remorseless
life
is
!
A
little
job
at
Court
!
He
had
married
this
lady
,
the
Honourable
Evelyn
,
and
they
lived
hereabouts
,
so
he
thought
(
looking
at
the
pompous
houses
overlooking
the
Park
)
,
for
he
had
lunched
there
once
in
a
house
which
had
,
like
all
Hugh
's
possessions
,
something
that
no
other
house
could
possibly
have
--
linen
cupboards
it
might
have
been
.
You
had
to
go
and
look
at
them
--
you
had
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
always
admiring
whatever
it
was
--
linen
cupboards
,
pillow-cases
,
old
oak
furniture
,
pictures
,
which
Hugh
had
picked
up
for
an
old
song
.
But
Mrs.
Hugh
sometimes
gave
the
show
away
.
She
was
one
of
those
obscure
mouse-like
little
women
who
admire
big
men
.
She
was
almost
negligible
.
Then
suddenly
she
would
say
something
quite
unexpected
--
something
sharp
.
She
had
the
relics
of
the
grand
manner
perhaps
.
The
steam
coal
was
a
little
too
strong
for
her
--
it
made
the
atmosphere
thick
.
And
so
there
they
lived
,
with
their
linen
cupboards
and
their
old
masters
and
their
pillow-cases
fringed
with
real
lace
at
the
rate
of
five
or
ten
thousand
a
year
presumably
,
while
he
,
who
was
two
years
older
than
Hugh
,
cadged
for
a
job
.
At
fifty-three
he
had
to
come
and
ask
them
to
put
him
into
some
secretary
's
office
,
to
find
him
some
usher
's
job
teaching
little
boys
Latin
,
at
the
beck
and
call
of
some
mandarin
in
an
office
,
something
that
brought
in
five
hundred
a
year
;
for
if
he
married
Daisy
,
even
with
his
pension
,
they
could
never
do
on
less
.
Whitbread
could
do
it
presumably
;
or
Dalloway
.
He
did
n't
mind
what
he
asked
Dalloway
.
He
was
a
thorough
good
sort
;
a
bit
limited
;
a
bit
thick
in
the
head
;
yes
;
but
a
thorough
good
sort
.
Whatever
he
took
up
he
did
in
the
same
matter-of-fact
sensible
way
;
without
a
touch
of
imagination
,
without
a
spark
of
brilliancy
,
but
with
the
inexplicable
niceness
of
his
type
.
He
ought
to
have
been
a
country
gentleman
--
he
was
wasted
on
politics
.
He
was
at
his
best
out
of
doors
,
with
horses
and
dogs
--
how
good
he
was
,
for
instance
,
when
that
great
shaggy
dog
of
Clarissa
's
got
caught
in
a
trap
and
had
its
paw
half
torn
off
,
and
Clarissa
turned
faint
and
Dalloway
did
the
whole
thing
;
bandaged
,
made
splints
;
told
Clarissa
not
to
be
a
fool
.
That
was
what
she
liked
him
for
perhaps
--
that
was
what
she
needed
.
``
Now
,
my
dear
,
do
n't
be
a
fool
.
Hold
this
--
fetch
that
,
''
all
the
time
talking
to
the
dog
as
if
it
were
a
human
being
.
But
how
could
she
swallow
all
that
stuff
about
poetry
?
How
could
she
let
him
hold
forth
about
Shakespeare
?
Seriously
and
solemnly
Richard
Dalloway
got
on
his
hind
legs
and
said
that
no
decent
man
ought
to
read
Shakespeare
's
sonnets
because
it
was
like
listening
at
keyholes
(
besides
the
relationship
was
not
one
that
he
approved
)
.
No
decent
man
ought
to
let
his
wife
visit
a
deceased
wife
's
sister
.
Incredible
!
The
only
thing
to
do
was
to
pelt
him
with
sugared
almonds
--
it
was
at
dinner
.
But
Clarissa
sucked
it
all
in
;
thought
it
so
honest
of
him
;
so
independent
of
him
;
Heaven
knows
if
she
did
n't
think
him
the
most
original
mind
she
'd
ever
met
!
That
was
one
of
the
bonds
between
Sally
and
himself
.
There
was
a
garden
where
they
used
to
walk
,
a
walled-in
place
,
with
rose-bushes
and
giant
cauliflowers
--
he
could
remember
Sally
tearing
off
a
rose
,
stopping
to
exclaim
at
the
beauty
of
the
cabbage
leaves
in
the
moonlight
(
it
was
extraordinary
how
vividly
it
all
came
back
to
him
,
things
he
had
n't
thought
of
for
years
,
)
while
she
implored
him
,
half
laughing
of
course
,
to
carry
off
Clarissa
,
to
save
her
from
the
Hughs
and
the
Dalloways
and
all
the
other
``
perfect
gentlemen
''
who
would
``
stifle
her
soul
''
(
she
wrote
reams
of
poetry
in
those
days
)
,
make
a
mere
hostess
of
her
,
encourage
her
worldliness
.
But
one
must
do
Clarissa
justice
.
She
was
n't
going
to
marry
Hugh
anyhow
.
She
had
a
perfectly
clear
notion
of
what
she
wanted
.
Her
emotions
were
all
on
the
surface
.
Beneath
,
she
was
very
shrewd
--
a
far
better
judge
of
character
than
Sally
,
for
instance
,
and
with
it
all
,
purely
feminine
;
with
that
extraordinary
gift
,
that
woman
's
gift
,
of
making
a
world
of
her
own
wherever
she
happened
to
be
.
She
came
into
a
room
;
she
stood
,
as
he
had
often
seen
her
,
in
a
doorway
with
lots
of
people
round
her
.
But
it
was
Clarissa
one
remembered
.
Not
that
she
was
striking
;
not
beautiful
at
all
;
there
was
nothing
picturesque
about
her
;
she
never
said
anything
specially
clever
;
there
she
was
,
however
;
there
she
was
.
No
,
no
,
no
!
He
was
not
in
love
with
her
any
more
!
He
only
felt
,
after
seeing
her
that
morning
,
among
her
scissors
and
silks
,
making
ready
for
the
party
,
unable
to
get
away
from
the
thought
of
her
;
she
kept
coming
back
and
back
like
a
sleeper
jolting
against
him
in
a
railway
carriage
;
which
was
not
being
in
love
,
of
course
;
it
was
thinking
of
her
,
criticising
her
,
starting
again
,
after
thirty
years
,
trying
to
explain
her
.
The
obvious
thing
to
say
of
her
was
that
she
was
worldly
;
cared
too
much
for
rank
and
society
and
getting
on
in
the
world
--
which
was
true
in
a
sense
;
she
had
admitted
it
to
him
.
(
You
could
always
get
her
to
own
up
if
you
took
the
trouble
;
she
was
honest
.
)
What
she
would
say
was
that
she
hated
frumps
,
fogies
,
failures
,
like
himself
presumably
;
thought
people
had
no
right
to
slouch
about
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
;
must
do
something
,
be
something
;
and
these
great
swells
,
these
Duchesses
,
these
hoary
old
Countesses
one
met
in
her
drawing-room
,
unspeakably
remote
as
he
felt
them
to
be
from
anything
that
mattered
a
straw
,
stood
for
something
real
to
her
.
Lady
Bexborough
,
she
said
once
,
held
herself
upright
(
so
did
Clarissa
herself
;
she
never
lounged
in
any
sense
of
the
word
;
she
was
straight
as
a
dart
,
a
little
rigid
in
fact
)
.
She
said
they
had
a
kind
of
courage
which
the
older
she
grew
the
more
she
respected
.
In
all
this
there
was
a
great
deal
of
Dalloway
,
of
course
;
a
great
deal
of
the
public-spirited
,
British
Empire
,
tariff-reform
,
governing-class
spirit
,
which
had
grown
on
her
,
as
it
tends
to
do
.
With
twice
his
wits
,
she
had
to
see
things
through
his
eyes
--
one
of
the
tragedies
of
married
life
.
With
a
mind
of
her
own
,
she
must
always
be
quoting
Richard
--
as
if
one
could
n't
know
to
a
tittle
what
Richard
thought
by
reading
the
Morning
Post
of
a
morning
!
These
parties
for
example
were
all
for
him
,
or
for
her
idea
of
him
(
to
do
Richard
justice
he
would
have
been
happier
farming
in
Norfolk
)
.
She
made
her
drawing-room
a
sort
of
meeting-place
;
she
had
a
genius
for
it
.
Over
and
over
again
he
had
seen
her
take
some
raw
youth
,
twist
him
,
turn
him
,
wake
him
up
;
set
him
going
.
Infinite
numbers
of
dull
people
conglomerated
round
her
of
course
.
But
odd
unexpected
people
turned
up
;
an
artist
sometimes
;
sometimes
a
writer
;
queer
fish
in
that
atmosphere
.
And
behind
it
all
was
that
network
of
visiting
,
leaving
cards
,
being
kind
to
people
;
running
about
with
bunches
of
flowers
,
little
presents
;
So-and-so
was
going
to
France
--
must
have
an
air-cushion
;
a
real
drain
on
her
strength
;
all
that
interminable
traffic
that
women
of
her
sort
keep
up
;
but
she
did
it
genuinely
,
from
a
natural
instinct
.
Oddly
enough
,
she
was
one
of
the
most
thoroughgoing
sceptics
he
had
ever
met
,
and
possibly
(
this
was
a
theory
he
used
to
make
up
to
account
for
her
,
so
transparent
in
some
ways
,
so
inscrutable
in
others
)
,
possibly
she
said
to
herself
,
As
we
are
a
doomed
race
,
chained
to
a
sinking
ship
(
her
favourite
reading
as
a
girl
was
Huxley
and
Tyndall
,
and
they
were
fond
of
these
nautical
metaphors
)
,
as
the
whole
thing
is
a
bad
joke
,
let
us
,
at
any
rate
,
do
our
part
;
mitigate
the
sufferings
of
our
fellow-prisoners
(
Huxley
again
)
;
decorate
the
dungeon
with
flowers
and
air-cushions
;
be
as
decent
as
we
possibly
can
.
Those
ruffians
,
the
Gods
,
sha
n't
have
it
all
their
own
way
,
--
her
notion
being
that
the
Gods
,
who
never
lost
a
chance
of
hurting
,
thwarting
and
spoiling
human
lives
were
seriously
put
out
if
,
all
the
same
,
you
behaved
like
a
lady
.
That
phase
came
directly
after
Sylvia
's
death
--
that
horrible
affair
.
To
see
your
own
sister
killed
by
a
falling
tree
(
all
Justin
Parry
's
fault
--
all
his
carelessness
)
before
your
very
eyes
,
a
girl
too
on
the
verge
of
life
,
the
most
gifted
of
them
,
Clarissa
always
said
,
was
enough
to
turn
one
bitter
.
Later
she
was
n't
so
positive
perhaps
;
she
thought
there
were
no
Gods
;
no
one
was
to
blame
;
and
so
she
evolved
this
atheist
's
religion
of
doing
good
for
the
sake
of
goodness
.
And
of
course
she
enjoyed
life
immensely
.
It
was
her
nature
to
enjoy
(
though
goodness
only
knows
,
she
had
her
reserves
;
it
was
a
mere
sketch
,
he
often
felt
,
that
even
he
,
after
all
these
years
,
could
make
of
Clarissa
)
.
Anyhow
there
was
no
bitterness
in
her
;
none
of
that
sense
of
moral
virtue
which
is
so
repulsive
in
good
women
.
She
enjoyed
practically
everything
.
If
you
walked
with
her
in
Hyde
Park
now
it
was
a
bed
of
tulips
,
now
a
child
in
a
perambulator
,
now
some
absurd
little
drama
she
made
up
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
.
(
Very
likely
,
she
would
have
talked
to
those
lovers
,
if
she
had
thought
them
unhappy
.
)
She
had
a
sense
of
comedy
that
was
really
exquisite
,
but
she
needed
people
,
always
people
,
to
bring
it
out
,
with
the
inevitable
result
that
she
frittered
her
time
away
,
lunching
,
dining
,
giving
these
incessant
parties
of
hers
,
talking
nonsense
,
sayings
things
she
did
n't
mean
,
blunting
the
edge
of
her
mind
,
losing
her
discrimination
.
There
she
would
sit
at
the
head
of
the
table
taking
infinite
pains
with
some
old
buffer
who
might
be
useful
to
Dalloway
--
they
knew
the
most
appalling
bores
in
Europe
--
or
in
came
Elizabeth
and
everything
must
give
way
to
her
.
She
was
at
a
High
School
,
at
the
inarticulate
stage
last
time
he
was
over
,
a
round-eyed
,
pale-faced
girl
,
with
nothing
of
her
mother
in
her
,
a
silent
stolid
creature
,
who
took
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
,
let
her
mother
make
a
fuss
of
her
,
and
then
said
``
May
I
go
now
?
''
like
a
child
of
four
;
going
off
,
Clarissa
explained
,
with
that
mixture
of
amusement
and
pride
which
Dalloway
himself
seemed
to
rouse
in
her
,
to
play
hockey
.
And
now
Elizabeth
was
``
out
,
''
presumably
;
thought
him
an
old
fogy
,
laughed
at
her
mother
's
friends
.
Ah
well
,
so
be
it
.
The
compensation
of
growing
old
,
Peter
Walsh
thought
,
coming
out
of
Regent
's
Park
,
and
holding
his
hat
in
hand
,
was
simply
this
;
that
the
passions
remain
as
strong
as
ever
,
but
one
has
gained
--
at
last
!
--
the
power
which
adds
the
supreme
flavour
to
existence
,
--
the
power
of
taking
hold
of
experience
,
of
turning
it
round
,
slowly
,
in
the
light
.
A
terrible
confession
it
was
(
he
put
his
hat
on
again
)
,
but
now
,
at
the
age
of
fifty-three
one
scarcely
needed
people
any
more
.
Life
itself
,
every
moment
of
it
,
every
drop
of
it
,
here
,
this
instant
,
now
,
in
the
sun
,
in
Regent
's
Park
,
was
enough
.
Too
much
indeed
.
A
whole
lifetime
was
too
short
to
bring
out
,
now
that
one
had
acquired
the
power
,
the
full
flavour
;
to
extract
every
ounce
of
pleasure
,
every
shade
of
meaning
;
which
both
were
so
much
more
solid
than
they
used
to
be
,
so
much
less
personal
.
It
was
impossible
that
he
should
ever
suffer
again
as
Clarissa
had
made
him
suffer
.
For
hours
at
a
time
(
pray
God
that
one
might
say
these
things
without
being
overheard
!
)
,
for
hours
and
days
he
never
thought
of
Daisy
.
Could
it
be
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
then
,
remembering
the
misery
,
the
torture
,
the
extraordinary
passion
of
those
days
?
It
was
a
different
thing
altogether
--
a
much
pleasanter
thing
--
the
truth
being
,
of
course
,
that
now
she
was
in
love
with
him
.
And
that
perhaps
was
the
reason
why
,
when
the
ship
actually
sailed
,
he
felt
an
extraordinary
relief
,
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
alone
;
was
annoyed
to
find
all
her
little
attentions
--
cigars
,
notes
,
a
rug
for
the
voyage
--
in
his
cabin
.
Every
one
if
they
were
honest
would
say
the
same
;
one
does
n't
want
people
after
fifty
;
one
does
n't
want
to
go
on
telling
women
they
are
pretty
;
that
's
what
most
men
of
fifty
would
say
,
Peter
Walsh
thought
,
if
they
were
honest
.
But
then
these
astonishing
accesses
of
emotion
--
bursting
into
tears
this
morning
,
what
was
all
that
about
?
What
could
Clarissa
have
thought
of
him
?
thought
him
a
fool
presumably
,
not
for
the
first
time
.
It
was
jealousy
that
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
--
jealousy
which
survives
every
other
passion
of
mankind
,
Peter
Walsh
thought
,
holding
his
pocket-knife
at
arm
's
length
.
She
had
been
meeting
Major
Orde
,
Daisy
said
in
her
last
letter
;
said
it
on
purpose
he
knew
;
said
it
to
make
him
jealous
;
he
could
see
her
wrinkling
her
forehead
as
she
wrote
,
wondering
what
she
could
say
to
hurt
him
;
and
yet
it
made
no
difference
;
he
was
furious
!
All
this
pother
of
coming
to
England
and
seeing
lawyers
was
n't
to
marry
her
,
but
to
prevent
her
from
marrying
anybody
else
.
That
was
what
tortured
him
,
that
was
what
came
over
him
when
he
saw
Clarissa
so
calm
,
so
cold
,
so
intent
on
her
dress
or
whatever
it
was
;
realising
what
she
might
have
spared
him
,
what
she
had
reduced
him
to
--
a
whimpering
,
snivelling
old
ass
.
But
women
,
he
thought
,
shutting
his
pocket-knife
,
do
n't
know
what
passion
is
.
They
do
n't
know
the
meaning
of
it
to
men
.
Clarissa
was
as
cold
as
an
icicle
.
There
she
would
sit
on
the
sofa
by
his
side
,
let
him
take
her
hand
,
give
him
one
kiss
--
Here
he
was
at
the
crossing
.
A
sound
interrupted
him
;
a
frail
quivering
sound
,
a
voice
bubbling
up
without
direction
,
vigour
,
beginning
or
end
,
running
weakly
and
shrilly
and
with
an
absence
of
all
human
meaning
into
ee
um
fah
um
so
foo
swee
too
eem
oo
--
the
voice
of
no
age
or
sex
,
the
voice
of
an
ancient
spring
spouting
from
the
earth
;
which
issued
,
just
opposite
Regent
's
Park
Tube
station
from
a
tall
quivering
shape
,
like
a
funnel
,
like
a
rusty
pump
,
like
a
wind-beaten
tree
for
ever
barren
of
leaves
which
lets
the
wind
run
up
and
down
its
branches
singing
ee
um
fah
um
so
foo
swee
too
eem
oo
and
rocks
and
creaks
and
moans
in
the
eternal
breeze
.
Through
all
ages
--
when
the
pavement
was
grass
,
when
it
was
swamp
,
through
the
age
of
tusk
and
mammoth
,
through
the
age
of
silent
sunrise
,
the
battered
woman
--
for
she
wore
a
skirt
--
with
her
right
hand
exposed
,
her
left
clutching
at
her
side
,
stood
singing
of
love
--
love
which
has
lasted
a
million
years
,
she
sang
,
love
which
prevails
,
and
millions
of
years
ago
,
her
lover
,
who
had
been
dead
these
centuries
,
had
walked
,
she
crooned
,
with
her
in
May
;
but
in
the
course
of
ages
,
long
as
summer
days
,
and
flaming
,
she
remembered
,
with
nothing
but
red
asters
,
he
had
gone
;
death
's
enormous
sickle
had
swept
those
tremendous
hills
,
and
when
at
last
she
laid
her
hoary
and
immensely
aged
head
on
the
earth
,
now
become
a
mere
cinder
of
ice
,
she
implored
the
Gods
to
lay
by
her
side
a
bunch
of
purple-heather
,
there
on
her
high
burial
place
which
the
last
rays
of
the
last
sun
caressed
;
for
then
the
pageant
of
the
universe
would
be
over
.
As
the
ancient
song
bubbled
up
opposite
Regent
's
Park
Tube
station
still
the
earth
seemed
green
and
flowery
;
still
,
though
it
issued
from
so
rude
a
mouth
,
a
mere
hole
in
the
earth
,
muddy
too
,
matted
with
root
fibres
and
tangled
grasses
,
still
the
old
bubbling
burbling
song
,
soaking
through
the
knotted
roots
of
infinite
ages
,
and
skeletons
and
treasure
,
streamed
away
in
rivulets
over
the
pavement
and
all
along
the
Marylebone
Road
,
and
down
towards
Euston
,
fertilising
,
leaving
a
damp
stain
.
Still
remembering
how
once
in
some
primeval
May
she
had
walked
with
her
lover
,
this
rusty
pump
,
this
battered
old
woman
with
one
hand
exposed
for
coppers
the
other
clutching
her
side
,
would
still
be
there
in
ten
million
years
,
remembering
how
once
she
had
walked
in
May
,
where
the
sea
flows
now
,
with
whom
it
did
not
matter
--
he
was
a
man
,
oh
yes
,
a
man
who
had
loved
her
.
But
the
passage
of
ages
had
blurred
the
clarity
of
that
ancient
May
day
;
the
bright
petalled
flowers
were
hoar
and
silver
frosted
;
and
she
no
longer
saw
,
when
she
implored
him
(
as
she
did
now
quite
clearly
)
``
look
in
my
eyes
with
thy
sweet
eyes
intently
,
''
she
no
longer
saw
brown
eyes
,
black
whiskers
or
sunburnt
face
but
only
a
looming
shape
,
a
shadow
shape
,
to
which
,
with
the
bird-like
freshness
of
the
very
aged
she
still
twittered
``
give
me
your
hand
and
let
me
press
it
gently
''
(
Peter
Walsh
could
n't
help
giving
the
poor
creature
a
coin
as
he
stepped
into
his
taxi
)
,
``
and
if
some
one
should
see
,
what
matter
they
?
''
she
demanded
;
and
her
fist
clutched
at
her
side
,
and
she
smiled
,
pocketing
her
shilling
,
and
all
peering
inquisitive
eyes
seemed
blotted
out
,
and
the
passing
generations
--
the
pavement
was
crowded
with
bustling
middle-class
people
--
vanished
,
like
leaves
,
to
be
trodden
under
,
to
be
soaked
and
steeped
and
made
mould
of
by
that
eternal
spring
--
ee
um
fah
um
so
foo
swee
too
eem
oo
``
Poor
old
woman
,
''
said
Rezia
Warren
Smith
,
waiting
to
cross
.
Oh
poor
old
wretch
!
Suppose
it
was
a
wet
night
?
Suppose
one
's
father
,
or
somebody
who
had
known
one
in
better
days
had
happened
to
pass
,
and
saw
one
standing
there
in
the
gutter
?
And
where
did
she
sleep
at
night
?
Cheerfully
,
almost
gaily
,
the
invincible
thread
of
sound
wound
up
into
the
air
like
the
smoke
from
a
cottage
chimney
,
winding
up
clean
beech
trees
and
issuing
in
a
tuft
of
blue
smoke
among
the
topmost
leaves
.
``
And
if
some
one
should
see
,
what
matter
they
?
''
Since
she
was
so
unhappy
,
for
weeks
and
weeks
now
,
Rezia
had
given
meanings
to
things
that
happened
,
almost
felt
sometimes
that
she
must
stop
people
in
the
street
,
if
they
looked
good
,
kind
people
,
just
to
say
to
them
``
I
am
unhappy
''
;
and
this
old
woman
singing
in
the
street
``
if
some
one
should
see
,
what
matter
they
?
''
made
her
suddenly
quite
sure
that
everything
was
going
to
be
right
.
They
were
going
to
Sir
William
Bradshaw
;
she
thought
his
name
sounded
nice
;
he
would
cure
Septimus
at
once
.
And
then
there
was
a
brewer
's
cart
,
and
the
grey
horses
had
upright
bristles
of
straw
in
their
tails
;
there
were
newspaper
placards
.
It
was
a
silly
,
silly
dream
,
being
unhappy
.
So
they
crossed
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Septimus
Warren
Smith
,
and
was
there
,
after
all
,
anything
to
draw
attention
to
them
,
anything
to
make
a
passer-by
suspect
here
is
a
young
man
who
carries
in
him
the
greatest
message
in
the
world
,
and
is
,
moreover
,
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
,
and
the
most
miserable
?
Perhaps
they
walked
more
slowly
than
other
people
,
and
there
was
something
hesitating
,
trailing
,
in
the
man
's
walk
,
but
what
more
natural
for
a
clerk
,
who
has
not
been
in
the
West
End
on
a
weekday
at
this
hour
for
years
,
than
to
keep
looking
at
the
sky
,
looking
at
this
,
that
and
the
other
,
as
if
Portland
Place
were
a
room
he
had
come
into
when
the
family
are
away
,
the
chandeliers
being
hung
in
holland
bags
,
and
the
caretaker
,
as
she
lets
in
long
shafts
of
dusty
light
upon
deserted
,
queer-looking
armchairs
,
lifting
one
corner
of
the
long
blinds
,
explains
to
the
visitors
what
a
wonderful
place
it
is
;
how
wonderful
,
but
at
the
same
time
,
he
thinks
,
as
he
looks
at
chairs
and
tables
,
how
strange
.
To
look
at
,
he
might
have
been
a
clerk
,
but
of
the
better
sort
;
for
he
wore
brown
boots
;
his
hands
were
educated
;
so
,
too
,
his
profile
--
his
angular
,
big-nosed
,
intelligent
,
sensitive
profile
;
but
not
his
lips
altogether
,
for
they
were
loose
;
and
his
eyes
(
as
eyes
tend
to
be
)
,
eyes
merely
;
hazel
,
large
;
so
that
he
was
,
on
the
whole
,
a
border
case
,
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
,
might
end
with
a
house
at
Purley
and
a
motor
car
,
or
continue
renting
apartments
in
back
streets
all
his
life
;
one
of
those
half-educated
,
self-educated
men
whose
education
is
all
learnt
from
books
borrowed
from
public
libraries
,
read
in
the
evening
after
the
day
's
work
,
on
the
advice
of
well-known
authors
consulted
by
letter
.
As
for
the
other
experiences
,
the
solitary
ones
,
which
people
go
through
alone
,
in
their
bedrooms
,
in
their
offices
,
walking
the
fields
and
the
streets
of
London
,
he
had
them
;
had
left
home
,
a
mere
boy
,
because
of
his
mother
;
she
lied
;
because
he
came
down
to
tea
for
the
fiftieth
time
with
his
hands
unwashed
;
because
he
could
see
no
future
for
a
poet
in
Stroud
;
and
so
,
making
a
confidant
of
his
little
sister
,
had
gone
to
London
leaving
an
absurd
note
behind
him
,
such
as
great
men
have
written
,
and
the
world
has
read
later
when
the
story
of
their
struggles
has
become
famous
.
London
has
swallowed
up
many
millions
of
young
men
called
Smith
;
thought
nothing
of
fantastic
Christian
names
like
Septimus
with
which
their
parents
have
thought
to
distinguish
them
.
Lodging
off
the
Euston
Road
,
there
were
experiences
,
again
experiences
,
such
as
change
a
face
in
two
years
from
a
pink
innocent
oval
to
a
face
lean
,
contracted
,
hostile
.
But
of
all
this
what
could
the
most
observant
of
friends
have
said
except
what
a
gardener
says
when
he
opens
the
conservatory
door
in
the
morning
and
finds
a
new
blossom
on
his
plant
:
--
It
has
flowered
;
flowered
from
vanity
,
ambition
,
idealism
,
passion
,
loneliness
,
courage
,
laziness
,
the
usual
seeds
,
which
all
muddled
up
(
in
a
room
off
the
Euston
Road
)
,
made
him
shy
,
and
stammering
,
made
him
anxious
to
improve
himself
,
made
him
fall
in
love
with
Miss
Isabel
Pole
,
lecturing
in
the
Waterloo
Road
upon
Shakespeare
.
Was
he
not
like
Keats
?
she
asked
;
and
reflected
how
she
might
give
him
a
taste
of
Antony
and
Cleopatra
and
the
rest
;
lent
him
books
;
wrote
him
scraps
of
letters
;
and
lit
in
him
such
a
fire
as
burns
only
once
in
a
lifetime
,
without
heat
,
flickering
a
red
gold
flame
infinitely
ethereal
and
insubstantial
over
Miss
Pole
;
Antony
and
Cleopatra
;
and
the
Waterloo
Road
.
He
thought
her
beautiful
,
believed
her
impeccably
wise
;
dreamed
of
her
,
wrote
poems
to
her
,
which
,
ignoring
the
subject
,
she
corrected
in
red
ink
;
he
saw
her
,
one
summer
evening
,
walking
in
a
green
dress
in
a
square
.
``
It
has
flowered
,
''
the
gardener
might
have
said
,
had
he
opened
the
door
;
had
he
come
in
,
that
is
to
say
,
any
night
about
this
time
,
and
found
him
writing
;
found
him
tearing
up
his
writing
;
found
him
finishing
a
masterpiece
at
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
running
out
to
pace
the
streets
,
and
visiting
churches
,
and
fasting
one
day
,
drinking
another
,
devouring
Shakespeare
,
Darwin
,
The
History
of
Civilisation
,
and
Bernard
Shaw
.
Something
was
up
,
Mr
.
Brewer
knew
;
Mr
.
Brewer
,
managing
clerk
at
Sibleys
and
Arrowsmiths
,
auctioneers
,
valuers
,
land
and
estate
agents
;
something
was
up
,
he
thought
,
and
,
being
paternal
with
his
young
men
,
and
thinking
very
highly
of
Smith
's
abilities
,
and
prophesying
that
he
would
,
in
ten
or
fifteen
years
,
succeed
to
the
leather
arm-chair
in
the
inner
room
under
the
skylight
with
the
deed-boxes
round
him
,
``
if
he
keeps
his
health
,
''
said
Mr
.
Brewer
,
and
that
was
the
danger
--
he
looked
weakly
;
advised
football
,
invited
him
to
supper
and
was
seeing
his
way
to
consider
recommending
a
rise
of
salary
,
when
something
happened
which
threw
out
many
of
Mr
.
Brewer
's
calculations
,
took
away
his
ablest
young
fellows
,
and
eventually
,
so
prying
and
insidious
were
the
fingers
of
the
European
War
,
smashed
a
plaster
cast
of
Ceres
,
ploughed
a
hole
in
the
geranium
beds
,
and
utterly
ruined
the
cook
's
nerves
at
Mr
.
Brewer
's
establishment
at
Muswell
Hill
.
Septimus
was
one
of
the
first
to
volunteer
.
He
went
to
France
to
save
an
England
which
consisted
almost
entirely
of
Shakespeare
's
plays
and
Miss
Isabel
Pole
in
a
green
dress
walking
in
a
square
.
There
in
the
trenches
the
change
which
Mr
.
Brewer
desired
when
he
advised
football
was
produced
instantly
;
he
developed
manliness
;
he
was
promoted
;
he
drew
the
attention
,
indeed
the
affection
of
his
officer
,
Evans
by
name
.
It
was
a
case
of
two
dogs
playing
on
a
hearth-rug
;
one
worrying
a
paper
screw
,
snarling
,
snapping
,
giving
a
pinch
,
now
and
then
,
at
the
old
dog
's
ear
;
the
other
lying
somnolent
,
blinking
at
the
fire
,
raising
a
paw
,
turning
and
growling
good-temperedly
.
They
had
to
be
together
,
share
with
each
other
,
fight
with
each
other
,
quarrel
with
each
other
.
But
when
Evans
(
Rezia
who
had
only
seen
him
once
called
him
``
a
quiet
man
,
''
a
sturdy
red-haired
man
,
undemonstrative
in
the
company
of
women
)
,
when
Evans
was
killed
,
just
before
the
Armistice
,
in
Italy
,
Septimus
,
far
from
showing
any
emotion
or
recognising
that
here
was
the
end
of
a
friendship
,
congratulated
himself
upon
feeling
very
little
and
very
reasonably
.
The
War
had
taught
him
.
It
was
sublime
.
He
had
gone
through
the
whole
show
,
friendship
,
European
War
,
death
,
had
won
promotion
,
was
still
under
thirty
and
was
bound
to
survive
.
He
was
right
there
.
The
last
shells
missed
him
.
He
watched
them
explode
with
indifference
.
When
peace
came
he
was
in
Milan
,
billeted
in
the
house
of
an
innkeeper
with
a
courtyard
,
flowers
in
tubs
,
little
tables
in
the
open
,
daughters
making
hats
,
and
to
Lucrezia
,
the
younger
daughter
,
he
became
engaged
one
evening
when
the
panic
was
on
him
--
that
he
could
not
feel
.
For
now
that
it
was
all
over
,
truce
signed
,
and
the
dead
buried
,
he
had
,
especially
in
the
evening
,
these
sudden
thunder-claps
of
fear
.
He
could
not
feel
.
As
he
opened
the
door
of
the
room
where
the
Italian
girls
sat
making
hats
,
he
could
see
them
;
could
hear
them
;
they
were
rubbing
wires
among
coloured
beads
in
saucers
;
they
were
turning
buckram
shapes
this
way
and
that
;
the
table
was
all
strewn
with
feathers
,
spangles
,
silks
,
ribbons
;
scissors
were
rapping
on
the
table
;
but
something
failed
him
;
he
could
not
feel
.
Still
,
scissors
rapping
,
girls
laughing
,
hats
being
made
protected
him
;
he
was
assured
of
safety
;
he
had
a
refuge
.
But
he
could
not
sit
there
all
night
.
There
were
moments
of
waking
in
the
early
morning
.
The
bed
was
falling
;
he
was
falling
.
Oh
for
the
scissors
and
the
lamplight
and
the
buckram
shapes
!
He
asked
Lucrezia
to
marry
him
,
the
younger
of
the
two
,
the
gay
,
the
frivolous
,
with
those
little
artist
's
fingers
that
she
would
hold
up
and
say
``
It
is
all
in
them
.
''
Silk
,
feathers
,
what
not
were
alive
to
them
.
``
It
is
the
hat
that
matters
most
,
''
she
would
say
,
when
they
walked
out
together
.
Every
hat
that
passed
,
she
would
examine
;
and
the
cloak
and
the
dress
and
the
way
the
woman
held
herself
.
Ill-dressing
,
over-dressing
she
stigmatised
,
not
savagely
,
rather
with
impatient
movements
of
the
hands
,
like
those
of
a
painter
who
puts
from
him
some
obvious
well-meant
glaring
imposture
;
and
then
,
generously
,
but
always
critically
,
she
would
welcome
a
shopgirl
who
had
turned
her
little
bit
of
stuff
gallantly
,
or
praise
,
wholly
,
with
enthusiastic
and
professional
understanding
,
a
French
lady
descending
from
her
carriage
,
in
chinchilla
,
robes
,
pearls
.
``
Beautiful
!
''
she
would
murmur
,
nudging
Septimus
,
that
he
might
see
.
But
beauty
was
behind
a
pane
of
glass
.
Even
taste
(
Rezia
liked
ices
,
chocolates
,
sweet
things
)
had
no
relish
to
him
.
He
put
down
his
cup
on
the
little
marble
table
.
He
looked
at
people
outside
;
happy
they
seemed
,
collecting
in
the
middle
of
the
street
,
shouting
,
laughing
,
squabbling
over
nothing
.
But
he
could
not
taste
,
he
could
not
feel
.
In
the
tea-shop
among
the
tables
and
the
chattering
waiters
the
appalling
fear
came
over
him
--
he
could
not
feel
.
He
could
reason
;
he
could
read
,
Dante
for
example
,
quite
easily
(
``
Septimus
,
do
put
down
your
book
,
''
said
Rezia
,
gently
shutting
the
Inferno
)
,
he
could
add
up
his
bill
;
his
brain
was
perfect
;
it
must
be
the
fault
of
the
world
then
--
that
he
could
not
feel
.
``
The
English
are
so
silent
,
''
Rezia
said
.
She
liked
it
,
she
said
.
She
respected
these
Englishmen
,
and
wanted
to
see
London
,
and
the
English
horses
,
and
the
tailor-made
suits
,
and
could
remember
hearing
how
wonderful
the
shops
were
,
from
an
Aunt
who
had
married
and
lived
in
Soho
.
It
might
be
possible
,
Septimus
thought
,
looking
at
England
from
the
train
window
,
as
they
left
Newhaven
;
it
might
be
possible
that
the
world
itself
is
without
meaning
.
At
the
office
they
advanced
him
to
a
post
of
considerable
responsibility
.
They
were
proud
of
him
;
he
had
won
crosses
.
``
You
have
done
your
duty
;
it
is
up
to
us
--
''
began
Mr
.
Brewer
;
and
could
not
finish
,
so
pleasurable
was
his
emotion
.
They
took
admirable
lodgings
off
the
Tottenham
Court
Road
.
Here
he
opened
Shakespeare
once
more
.
That
boy
's
business
of
the
intoxication
of
language
--
Antony
and
Cleopatra
--
had
shrivelled
utterly
.
How
Shakespeare
loathed
humanity
--
the
putting
on
of
clothes
,
the
getting
of
children
,
the
sordidity
of
the
mouth
and
the
belly
!
This
was
now
revealed
to
Septimus
;
the
message
hidden
in
the
beauty
of
words
.
The
secret
signal
which
one
generation
passes
,
under
disguise
,
to
the
next
is
loathing
,
hatred
,
despair
.
Dante
the
same
.
Aeschylus
(
translated
)
the
same
.
There
Rezia
sat
at
the
table
trimming
hats
.
She
trimmed
hats
for
Mrs.
Filmer
's
friends
;
she
trimmed
hats
by
the
hour
.
She
looked
pale
,
mysterious
,
like
a
lily
,
drowned
,
under
water
,
he
thought
.
``
The
English
are
so
serious
,
''
she
would
say
,
putting
her
arms
round
Septimus
,
her
cheek
against
his
.
Love
between
man
and
woman
was
repulsive
to
Shakespeare
.
The
business
of
copulation
was
filth
to
him
before
the
end
.
But
,
Rezia
said
,
she
must
have
children
.
They
had
been
married
five
years
.
They
went
to
the
Tower
together
;
to
the
Victoria
and
Albert
Museum
;
stood
in
the
crowd
to
see
the
King
open
Parliament
.
And
there
were
the
shops
--
hat
shops
,
dress
shops
,
shops
with
leather
bags
in
the
window
,
where
she
would
stand
staring
.
But
she
must
have
a
boy
.
She
must
have
a
son
like
Septimus
,
she
said
.
But
nobody
could
be
like
Septimus
;
so
gentle
;
so
serious
;
so
clever
.
Could
she
not
read
Shakespeare
too
?
Was
Shakespeare
a
difficult
author
?
she
asked
.
One
can
not
bring
children
into
a
world
like
this
.
One
can
not
perpetuate
suffering
,
or
increase
the
breed
of
these
lustful
animals
,
who
have
no
lasting
emotions
,
but
only
whims
and
vanities
,
eddying
them
now
this
way
,
now
that
.
He
watched
her
snip
,
shape
,
as
one
watches
a
bird
hop
,
flit
in
the
grass
,
without
daring
to
move
a
finger
.
For
the
truth
is
(
let
her
ignore
it
)
that
human
beings
have
neither
kindness
,
nor
faith
,
nor
charity
beyond
what
serves
to
increase
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
.
They
hunt
in
packs
.
Their
packs
scour
the
desert
and
vanish
screaming
into
the
wilderness
.
They
desert
the
fallen
.
They
are
plastered
over
with
grimaces
.
There
was
Brewer
at
the
office
,
with
his
waxed
moustache
,
coral
tie-pin
,
white
slip
,
and
pleasurable
emotions
--
all
coldness
and
clamminess
within
,
--
his
geraniums
ruined
in
the
War
--
his
cook
's
nerves
destroyed
;
or
Amelia
What'shername
,
handing
round
cups
of
tea
punctually
at
five
--
a
leering
,
sneering
obscene
little
harpy
;
and
the
Toms
and
Berties
in
their
starched
shirt
fronts
oozing
thick
drops
of
vice
.
They
never
saw
him
drawing
pictures
of
them
naked
at
their
antics
in
his
notebook
.
In
the
street
,
vans
roared
past
him
;
brutality
blared
out
on
placards
;
men
were
trapped
in
mines
;
women
burnt
alive
;
and
once
a
maimed
file
of
lunatics
being
exercised
or
displayed
for
the
diversion
of
the
populace
(
who
laughed
aloud
)
,
ambled
and
nodded
and
grinned
past
him
,
in
the
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
each
half
apologetically
,
yet
triumphantly
,
inflicting
his
hopeless
woe
.
And
would
he
go
mad
?
At
tea
Rezia
told
him
that
Mrs.
Filmer
's
daughter
was
expecting
a
baby
.
She
could
not
grow
old
and
have
no
children
!
She
was
very
lonely
,
she
was
very
unhappy
!
She
cried
for
the
first
time
since
they
were
married
.
Far
away
he
heard
her
sobbing
;
he
heard
it
accurately
,
he
noticed
it
distinctly
;
he
compared
it
to
a
piston
thumping
.
But
he
felt
nothing
.
His
wife
was
crying
,
and
he
felt
nothing
;
only
each
time
she
sobbed
in
this
profound
,
this
silent
,
this
hopeless
way
,
he
descended
another
step
into
the
pit
.
At
last
,
with
a
melodramatic
gesture
which
he
assumed
mechanically
and
with
complete
consciousness
of
its
insincerity
,
he
dropped
his
head
on
his
hands
.
Now
he
had
surrendered
;
now
other
people
must
help
him
.
People
must
be
sent
for
.
He
gave
in
.
Nothing
could
rouse
him
.
Rezia
put
him
to
bed
.
She
sent
for
a
doctor
--
Mrs.
Filmer
's
Dr.
Holmes
.
Dr.
Holmes
examined
him
.
There
was
nothing
whatever
the
matter
,
said
Dr.
Holmes
.
Oh
,
what
a
relief
!
What
a
kind
man
,
what
a
good
man
!
thought
Rezia
.
When
he
felt
like
that
he
went
to
the
Music
Hall
,
said
Dr.
Holmes
.
He
took
a
day
off
with
his
wife
and
played
golf
.
Why
not
try
two
tabloids
of
bromide
dissolved
in
a
glass
of
water
at
bedtime
?
These
old
Bloomsbury
houses
,
said
Dr.
Holmes
,
tapping
the
wall
,
are
often
full
of
very
fine
panelling
,
which
the
landlords
have
the
folly
to
paper
over
.
Only
the
other
day
,
visiting
a
patient
,
Sir
Somebody
Something
in
Bedford
Square
--
So
there
was
no
excuse
;
nothing
whatever
the
matter
,
except
the
sin
for
which
human
nature
had
condemned
him
to
death
;
that
he
did
not
feel
.
He
had
not
cared
when
Evans
was
killed
;
that
was
worst
;
but
all
the
other
crimes
raised
their
heads
and
shook
their
fingers
and
jeered
and
sneered
over
the
rail
of
the
bed
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
at
the
prostrate
body
which
lay
realising
its
degradation
;
how
he
had
married
his
wife
without
loving
her
;
had
lied
to
her
;
seduced
her
;
outraged
Miss
Isabel
Pole
,
and
was
so
pocked
and
marked
with
vice
that
women
shuddered
when
they
saw
him
in
the
street
.
The
verdict
of
human
nature
on
such
a
wretch
was
death
.
Dr.
Holmes
came
again
.
Large
,
fresh
coloured
,
handsome
,
flicking
his
boots
,
looking
in
the
glass
,
he
brushed
it
all
aside
--
headaches
,
sleeplessness
,
fears
,
dreams
--
nerve
symptoms
and
nothing
more
,
he
said
.
If
Dr.
Holmes
found
himself
even
half
a
pound
below
eleven
stone
six
,
he
asked
his
wife
for
another
plate
of
porridge
at
breakfast
.
(
Rezia
would
learn
to
cook
porridge
.
)
But
,
he
continued
,
health
is
largely
a
matter
in
our
own
control
.
Throw
yourself
into
outside
interests
;
take
up
some
hobby
.
He
opened
Shakespeare
--
Antony
and
Cleopatra
;
pushed
Shakespeare
aside
.
Some
hobby
,
said
Dr.
Holmes
,
for
did
he
not
owe
his
own
excellent
health
(
and
he
worked
as
hard
as
any
man
in
London
)
to
the
fact
that
he
could
always
switch
off
from
his
patients
on
to
old
furniture
?
And
what
a
very
pretty
comb
,
if
he
might
say
so
,
Mrs.
Warren
Smith
was
wearing
!
When
the
damned
fool
came
again
,
Septimus
refused
to
see
him
.
Did
he
indeed
?
said
Dr.
Holmes
,
smiling
agreeably
.
Really
he
had
to
give
that
charming
little
lady
,
Mrs.
Smith
,
a
friendly
push
before
he
could
get
past
her
into
her
husband
's
bedroom
.
``
So
you
're
in
a
funk
,
''
he
said
agreeably
,
sitting
down
by
his
patient
's
side
.
He
had
actually
talked
of
killing
himself
to
his
wife
,
quite
a
girl
,
a
foreigner
,
was
n't
she
?
Did
n't
that
give
her
a
very
odd
idea
of
English
husbands
?
Did
n't
one
owe
perhaps
a
duty
to
one
's
wife
?
Would
n't
it
be
better
to
do
something
instead
of
lying
in
bed
?
For
he
had
had
forty
years
'
experience
behind
him
;
and
Septimus
could
take
Dr.
Holmes
's
word
for
it
--
there
was
nothing
whatever
the
matter
with
him
.
And
next
time
Dr.
Holmes
came
he
hoped
to
find
Smith
out
of
bed
and
not
making
that
charming
little
lady
his
wife
anxious
about
him
.
Human
nature
,
in
short
,
was
on
him
--
the
repulsive
brute
,
with
the
blood-red
nostrils
.
Holmes
was
on
him
.
Dr.
Holmes
came
quite
regularly
every
day
.
Once
you
stumble
,
Septimus
wrote
on
the
back
of
a
postcard
,
human
nature
is
on
you
.
Holmes
is
on
you
.
Their
only
chance
was
to
escape
,
without
letting
Holmes
know
;
to
Italy
--
anywhere
,
anywhere
,
away
from
Dr.
Holmes
.
But
Rezia
could
not
understand
him
.
Dr.
Holmes
was
such
a
kind
man
.
He
was
so
interested
in
Septimus
.
He
only
wanted
to
help
them
,
he
said
.
He
had
four
little
children
and
he
had
asked
her
to
tea
,
she
told
Septimus
.
So
he
was
deserted
.
The
whole
world
was
clamouring
:
Kill
yourself
,
kill
yourself
,
for
our
sakes
.
But
why
should
he
kill
himself
for
their
sakes
?
Food
was
pleasant
;
the
sun
hot
;
and
this
killing
oneself
,
how
does
one
set
about
it
,
with
a
table
knife
,
uglily
,
with
floods
of
blood
,
--
by
sucking
a
gaspipe
?
He
was
too
weak
;
he
could
scarcely
raise
his
hand
.
Besides
,
now
that
he
was
quite
alone
,
condemned
,
deserted
,
as
those
who
are
about
to
die
are
alone
,
there
was
a
luxury
in
it
,
an
isolation
full
of
sublimity
;
a
freedom
which
the
attached
can
never
know
.
Holmes
had
won
of
course
;
the
brute
with
the
red
nostrils
had
won
.
But
even
Holmes
himself
could
not
touch
this
last
relic
straying
on
the
edge
of
the
world
,
this
outcast
,
who
gazed
back
at
the
inhabited
regions
,
who
lay
,
like
a
drowned
sailor
,
on
the
shore
of
the
world
.
It
was
at
that
moment
(
Rezia
gone
shopping
)
that
the
great
revelation
took
place
.
A
voice
spoke
from
behind
the
screen
.
Evans
was
speaking
.
The
dead
were
with
him
.
``
Evans
,
Evans
!
''
he
cried
.
Mr.
Smith
was
talking
aloud
to
himself
,
Agnes
the
servant
girl
cried
to
Mrs.
Filmer
in
the
kitchen
.
``
Evans
,
Evans
,
''
he
had
said
as
she
brought
in
the
tray
.
She
jumped
,
she
did
.
She
scuttled
downstairs
.
And
Rezia
came
in
,
with
her
flowers
,
and
walked
across
the
room
,
and
put
the
roses
in
a
vase
,
upon
which
the
sun
struck
directly
,
and
it
went
laughing
,
leaping
round
the
room
.
She
had
had
to
buy
the
roses
,
Rezia
said
,
from
a
poor
man
in
the
street
.
But
they
were
almost
dead
already
,
she
said
,
arranging
the
roses
.
So
there
was
a
man
outside
;
Evans
presumably
;
and
the
roses
,
which
Rezia
said
were
half
dead
,
had
been
picked
by
him
in
the
fields
of
Greece
.
``
Communication
is
health
;
communication
is
happiness
,
communication
--
''
he
muttered
.
``
What
are
you
saying
,
Septimus
?
''
Rezia
asked
,
wild
with
terror
,
for
he
was
talking
to
himself
.
She
sent
Agnes
running
for
Dr.
Holmes
.
Her
husband
,
she
said
,
was
mad
.
He
scarcely
knew
her
.
``
You
brute
!
You
brute
!
''
cried
Septimus
,
seeing
human
nature
,
that
is
Dr.
Holmes
,
enter
the
room
.
``
Now
what
's
all
this
about
?
''
said
Dr.
Holmes
in
the
most
amiable
way
in
the
world
.
``
Talking
nonsense
to
frighten
your
wife
?
''
But
he
would
give
him
something
to
make
him
sleep
.
And
if
they
were
rich
people
,
said
Dr.
Holmes
,
looking
ironically
round
the
room
,
by
all
means
let
them
go
to
Harley
Street
;
if
they
had
no
confidence
in
him
,
said
Dr.
Holmes
,
looking
not
quite
so
kind
.
It
was
precisely
twelve
o'clock
;
twelve
by
Big
Ben
;
whose
stroke
was
wafted
over
the
northern
part
of
London
;
blent
with
that
of
other
clocks
,
mixed
in
a
thin
ethereal
way
with
the
clouds
and
wisps
of
smoke
,
and
died
up
there
among
the
seagulls
--
twelve
o'clock
struck
as
Clarissa
Dalloway
laid
her
green
dress
on
her
bed
,
and
the
Warren
Smiths
walked
down
Harley
Street
.
Twelve
was
the
hour
of
their
appointment
.
Probably
,
Rezia
thought
,
that
was
Sir
William
Bradshaw
's
house
with
the
grey
motor
car
in
front
of
it
.
The
leaden
circles
dissolved
in
the
air
.
Indeed
it
was
--
Sir
William
Bradshaw
's
motor
car
;
low
,
powerful
,
grey
with
plain
initials
'
interlocked
on
the
panel
,
as
if
the
pomps
of
heraldry
were
incongruous
,
this
man
being
the
ghostly
helper
,
the
priest
of
science
;
and
,
as
the
motor
car
was
grey
,
so
to
match
its
sober
suavity
,
grey
furs
,
silver
grey
rugs
were
heaped
in
it
,
to
keep
her
ladyship
warm
while
she
waited
.
For
often
Sir
William
would
travel
sixty
miles
or
more
down
into
the
country
to
visit
the
rich
,
the
afflicted
,
who
could
afford
the
very
large
fee
which
Sir
William
very
properly
charged
for
his
advice
.
Her
ladyship
waited
with
the
rugs
about
her
knees
an
hour
or
more
,
leaning
back
,
thinking
sometimes
of
the
patient
,
sometimes
,
excusably
,
of
the
wall
of
gold
,
mounting
minute
by
minute
while
she
waited
;
the
wall
of
gold
that
was
mounting
between
them
and
all
shifts
and
anxieties
(
she
had
borne
them
bravely
;
they
had
had
their
struggles
)
until
she
felt
wedged
on
a
calm
ocean
,
where
only
spice
winds
blow
;
respected
,
admired
,
envied
,
with
scarcely
anything
left
to
wish
for
,
though
she
regretted
her
stoutness
;
large
dinner-parties
every
Thursday
night
to
the
profession
;
an
occasional
bazaar
to
be
opened
;
Royalty
greeted
;
too
little
time
,
alas
,
with
her
husband
,
whose
work
grew
and
grew
;
a
boy
doing
well
at
Eton
;
she
would
have
liked
a
daughter
too
;
interests
she
had
,
however
,
in
plenty
;
child
welfare
;
the
after-care
of
the
epileptic
,
and
photography
,
so
that
if
there
was
a
church
building
,
or
a
church
decaying
,
she
bribed
the
sexton
,
got
the
key
and
took
photographs
,
which
were
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
from
the
work
of
professionals
,
while
she
waited
.
Sir
William
himself
was
no
longer
young
.
He
had
worked
very
hard
;
he
had
won
his
position
by
sheer
ability
(
being
the
son
of
a
shopkeeper
)
;
loved
his
profession
;
made
a
fine
figurehead
at
ceremonies
and
spoke
well
--
all
of
which
had
by
the
time
he
was
knighted
given
him
a
heavy
look
,
a
weary
look
(
the
stream
of
patients
being
so
incessant
,
the
responsibilities
and
privileges
of
his
profession
so
onerous
)
,
which
weariness
,
together
with
his
grey
hairs
,
increased
the
extraordinary
distinction
of
his
presence
and
gave
him
the
reputation
(
of
the
utmost
importance
in
dealing
with
nerve
cases
)
not
merely
of
lightning
skill
,
and
almost
infallible
accuracy
in
diagnosis
but
of
sympathy
;
tact
;
understanding
of
the
human
soul
.
He
could
see
the
first
moment
they
came
into
the
room
(
the
Warren
Smiths
they
were
called
)
;
he
was
certain
directly
he
saw
the
man
;
it
was
a
case
of
extreme
gravity
.
It
was
a
case
of
complete
breakdown
--
complete
physical
and
nervous
breakdown
,
with
every
symptom
in
an
advanced
stage
,
he
ascertained
in
two
or
three
minutes
(
writing
answers
to
questions
,
murmured
discreetly
,
on
a
pink
card
)
.
How
long
had
Dr.
Holmes
been
attending
him
?
Six
weeks
.
Prescribed
a
little
bromide
?
Said
there
was
nothing
the
matter
?
Ah
yes
(
those
general
practitioners
!
thought
Sir
William
.
It
took
half
his
time
to
undo
their
blunders
.
Some
were
irreparable
)
.
``
You
served
with
great
distinction
in
the
War
?
''
The
patient
repeated
the
word
``
war
''
interrogatively
.
He
was
attaching
meanings
to
words
of
a
symbolical
kind
.
A
serious
symptom
,
to
be
noted
on
the
card
.
``
The
War
?
''
the
patient
asked
.
The
European
War
--
that
little
shindy
of
schoolboys
with
gunpowder
?
Had
he
served
with
distinction
?
He
really
forgot
.
In
the
War
itself
he
had
failed
.
``
Yes
,
he
served
with
the
greatest
distinction
,
''
Rezia
assured
the
doctor
;
``
he
was
promoted
.
''
``
And
they
have
the
very
highest
opinion
of
you
at
your
office
?
''
Sir
William
murmured
,
glancing
at
Mr
.
Brewer
's
very
generously
worded
letter
.
``
So
that
you
have
nothing
to
worry
you
,
no
financial
anxiety
,
nothing
?
''
He
had
committed
an
appalling
crime
and
been
condemned
to
death
by
human
nature
.
``
I
have
--
I
have
,
''
he
began
,
``
committed
a
crime
--
''
``
He
has
done
nothing
wrong
whatever
,
''
Rezia
assured
the
doctor
.
If
Mr.
Smith
would
wait
,
said
Sir
William
,
he
would
speak
to
Mrs.
Smith
in
the
next
room
.
Her
husband
was
very
seriously
ill
,
Sir
William
said
.
Did
he
threaten
to
kill
himself
?
Oh
,
he
did
,
she
cried
.
But
he
did
not
mean
it
,
she
said
.
Of
course
not
.
It
was
merely
a
question
of
rest
,
said
Sir
William
;
of
rest
,
rest
,
rest
;
a
long
rest
in
bed
.
There
was
a
delightful
home
down
in
the
country
where
her
husband
would
be
perfectly
looked
after
.
Away
from
her
?
she
asked
.
Unfortunately
,
yes
;
the
people
we
care
for
most
are
not
good
for
us
when
we
are
ill
.
But
he
was
not
mad
,
was
he
?
Sir
William
said
he
never
spoke
of
``
madness
''
;
he
called
it
not
having
a
sense
of
proportion
.
But
her
husband
did
not
like
doctors
.
He
would
refuse
to
go
there
.
Shortly
and
kindly
Sir
William
explained
to
her
the
state
of
the
case
.
He
had
threatened
to
kill
himself
.
There
was
no
alternative
.
It
was
a
question
of
law
.
He
would
lie
in
bed
in
a
beautiful
house
in
the
country
.
The
nurses
were
admirable
.
Sir
William
would
visit
him
once
a
week
.
If
Mrs.
Warren
Smith
was
quite
sure
she
had
no
more
questions
to
ask
--
he
never
hurried
his
patients
--
they
would
return
to
her
husband
.
She
had
nothing
more
to
ask
--
not
of
Sir
William
.
So
they
returned
to
the
most
exalted
of
mankind
;
the
criminal
who
faced
his
judges
;
the
victim
exposed
on
the
heights
;
the
fugitive
;
the
drowned
sailor
;
the
poet
of
the
immortal
ode
;
the
Lord
who
had
gone
from
life
to
death
;
to
Septimus
Warren
Smith
,
who
sat
in
the
arm-chair
under
the
skylight
staring
at
a
photograph
of
Lady
Bradshaw
in
Court
dress
,
muttering
messages
about
beauty
.
``
We
have
had
our
little
talk
,
''
said
Sir
William
.
``
He
says
you
are
very
,
very
ill
,
''
Rezia
cried
.
``
We
have
been
arranging
that
you
should
go
into
a
home
,
''
said
Sir
William
.
``
One
of
Holmes
's
homes
?
''
sneered
Septimus
.
The
fellow
made
a
distasteful
impression
.
For
there
was
in
Sir
William
,
whose
father
had
been
a
tradesman
,
a
natural
respect
for
breeding
and
clothing
,
which
shabbiness
nettled
;
again
,
more
profoundly
,
there
was
in
Sir
William
,
who
had
never
had
time
for
reading
,
a
grudge
,
deeply
buried
,
against
cultivated
people
who
came
into
his
room
and
intimated
that
doctors
,
whose
profession
is
a
constant
strain
upon
all
the
highest
faculties
,
are
not
educated
men
.
``
One
of
my
homes
,
Mr.
Warren
Smith
,
''
he
said
,
``
where
we
will
teach
you
to
rest
.
''
And
there
was
just
one
thing
more
.
He
was
quite
certain
that
when
Mr.
Warren
Smith
was
well
he
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
frighten
his
wife
.
But
he
had
talked
of
killing
himself
.
``
We
all
have
our
moments
of
depression
,
''
said
Sir
William
.
Once
you
fall
,
Septimus
repeated
to
himself
,
human
nature
is
on
you
.
Holmes
and
Bradshaw
are
on
you
.
They
scour
the
desert
.
They
fly
screaming
into
the
wilderness
.
The
rack
and
the
thumbscrew
are
applied
.
Human
nature
is
remorseless
.
``
Impulses
came
upon
him
sometimes
?
''
Sir
William
asked
,
with
his
pencil
on
a
pink
card
.
That
was
his
own
affair
,
said
Septimus
.
``
Nobody
lives
for
himself
alone
,
''
said
Sir
William
,
glancing
at
the
photograph
of
his
wife
in
Court
dress
.
``
And
you
have
a
brilliant
career
before
you
,
''
said
Sir
William
.
There
was
Mr
.
Brewer
's
letter
on
the
table
.
``
An
exceptionally
brilliant
career
.
''
But
if
he
confessed
?
If
he
communicated
?
Would
they
let
him
off
then
,
his
torturers
?
``
I
--
I
--
''
he
stammered
.
But
what
was
his
crime
?
He
could
not
remember
it
.
``
Yes
?
''
Sir
William
encouraged
him
.
(
But
it
was
growing
late
.
)
Love
,
trees
,
there
is
no
crime
--
what
was
his
message
?
He
could
not
remember
it
.
``
I
--
I
--
''
Septimus
stammered
.
``
Try
to
think
as
little
about
yourself
as
possible
,
''
said
Sir
William
kindly
.
Really
,
he
was
not
fit
to
be
about
.
Was
there
anything
else
they
wished
to
ask
him
?
Sir
William
would
make
all
arrangements
(
he
murmured
to
Rezia
)
and
he
would
let
her
know
between
five
and
six
that
evening
he
murmured
.
``
Trust
everything
to
me
,
''
he
said
,
and
dismissed
them
.
Never
,
never
had
Rezia
felt
such
agony
in
her
life
!
She
had
asked
for
help
and
been
deserted
!
He
had
failed
them
!
Sir
William
Bradshaw
was
not
a
nice
man
.
The
upkeep
of
that
motor
car
alone
must
cost
him
quite
a
lot
,
said
Septimus
,
when
they
got
out
into
the
street
.
She
clung
to
his
arm
.
They
had
been
deserted
.
But
what
more
did
she
want
?
To
his
patients
he
gave
three-quarters
of
an
hour
;
and
if
in
this
exacting
science
which
has
to
do
with
what
,
after
all
,
we
know
nothing
about
--
the
nervous
system
,
the
human
brain
--
a
doctor
loses
his
sense
of
proportion
,
as
a
doctor
he
fails
.
Health
we
must
have
;
and
health
is
proportion
;
so
that
when
a
man
comes
into
your
room
and
says
he
is
Christ
(
a
common
delusion
)
,
and
has
a
message
,
as
they
mostly
have
,
and
threatens
,
as
they
often
do
,
to
kill
himself
,
you
invoke
proportion
;
order
rest
in
bed
;
rest
in
solitude
;
silence
and
rest
;
rest
without
friends
,
without
books
,
without
messages
;
six
months
'
rest
;
until
a
man
who
went
in
weighing
seven
stone
six
comes
out
weighing
twelve
.
Proportion
,
divine
proportion
,
Sir
William
's
goddess
,
was
acquired
by
Sir
William
walking
hospitals
,
catching
salmon
,
begetting
one
son
in
Harley
Street
by
Lady
Bradshaw
,
who
caught
salmon
herself
and
took
photographs
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
from
the
work
of
professionals
.
Worshipping
proportion
,
Sir
William
not
only
prospered
himself
but
made
England
prosper
,
secluded
her
lunatics
,
forbade
childbirth
,
penalised
despair
,
made
it
impossible
for
the
unfit
to
propagate
their
views
until
they
,
too
,
shared
his
sense
of
proportion
--
his
,
if
they
were
men
,
Lady
Bradshaw
's
if
they
were
women
(
she
embroidered
,
knitted
,
spent
four
nights
out
of
seven
at
home
with
her
son
)
,
so
that
not
only
did
his
colleagues
respect
him
,
his
subordinates
fear
him
,
but
the
friends
and
relations
of
his
patients
felt
for
him
the
keenest
gratitude
for
insisting
that
these
prophetic
Christs
and
Christesses
,
who
prophesied
the
end
of
the
world
,
or
the
advent
of
God
,
should
drink
milk
in
bed
,
as
Sir
William
ordered
;
Sir
William
with
his
thirty
years
'
experience
of
these
kinds
of
cases
,
and
his
infallible
instinct
,
this
is
madness
,
this
sense
;
in
fact
,
his
sense
of
proportion
.
But
Proportion
has
a
sister
,
less
smiling
,
more
formidable
,
a
Goddess
even
now
engaged
--
in
the
heat
and
sands
of
India
,
the
mud
and
swamp
of
Africa
,
the
purlieus
of
London
,
wherever
in
short
the
climate
or
the
devil
tempts
men
to
fall
from
the
true
belief
which
is
her
own
--
is
even
now
engaged
in
dashing
down
shrines
,
smashing
idols
,
and
setting
up
in
their
place
her
own
stern
countenance
.
Conversion
is
her
name
and
she
feasts
on
the
wills
of
the
weakly
,
loving
to
impress
,
to
impose
,
adoring
her
own
features
stamped
on
the
face
of
the
populace
.
At
Hyde
Park
Corner
on
a
tub
she
stands
preaching
;
shrouds
herself
in
white
and
walks
penitentially
disguised
as
brotherly
love
through
factories
and
parliaments
;
offers
help
,
but
desires
power
;
smites
out
of
her
way
roughly
the
dissentient
,
or
dissatisfied
;
bestows
her
blessing
on
those
who
,
looking
upward
,
catch
submissively
from
her
eyes
the
light
of
their
own
.
This
lady
too
(
Rezia
Warren
Smith
divined
it
)
had
her
dwelling
in
Sir
William
's
heart
,
though
concealed
,
as
she
mostly
is
,
under
some
plausible
disguise
;
some
venerable
name
;
love
,
duty
,
self
sacrifice
.
How
he
would
work
--
how
toil
to
raise
funds
,
propagate
reforms
,
initiate
institutions
!
But
conversion
,
fastidious
Goddess
,
loves
blood
better
than
brick
,
and
feasts
most
subtly
on
the
human
will
.
For
example
,
Lady
Bradshaw
.
Fifteen
years
ago
she
had
gone
under
.
It
was
nothing
you
could
put
your
finger
on
;
there
had
been
no
scene
,
no
snap
;
only
the
slow
sinking
,
water-logged
,
of
her
will
into
his
.
Sweet
was
her
smile
,
swift
her
submission
;
dinner
in
Harley
Street
,
numbering
eight
or
nine
courses
,
feeding
ten
or
fifteen
guests
of
the
professional
classes
,
was
smooth
and
urbane
.
Only
as
the
evening
wore
on
a
very
slight
dulness
,
or
uneasiness
perhaps
,
a
nervous
twitch
,
fumble
,
stumble
and
confusion
indicated
,
what
it
was
really
painful
to
believe
--
that
the
poor
lady
lied
.
Once
,
long
ago
,
she
had
caught
salmon
freely
:
now
,
quick
to
minister
to
the
craving
which
lit
her
husband
's
eye
so
oilily
for
dominion
,
for
power
,
she
cramped
,
squeezed
,
pared
,
pruned
,
drew
back
,
peeped
through
;
so
that
without
knowing
precisely
what
made
the
evening
disagreeable
,
and
caused
this
pressure
on
the
top
of
the
head
(
which
might
well
be
imputed
to
the
professional
conversation
,
or
the
fatigue
of
a
great
doctor
whose
life
,
Lady
Bradshaw
said
,
``
is
not
his
own
but
his
patients
'
''
)
disagreeable
it
was
:
so
that
guests
,
when
the
clock
struck
ten
,
breathed
in
the
air
of
Harley
Street
even
with
rapture
;
which
relief
,
however
,
was
denied
to
his
patients
.
There
in
the
grey
room
,
with
the
pictures
on
the
wall
,
and
the
valuable
furniture
,
under
the
ground
glass
skylight
,
they
learnt
the
extent
of
their
transgressions
;
huddled
up
in
arm-chairs
,
they
watched
him
go
through
,
for
their
benefit
,
a
curious
exercise
with
the
arms
,
which
he
shot
out
,
brought
sharply
back
to
his
hip
,
to
prove
(
if
the
patient
was
obstinate
)
that
Sir
William
was
master
of
his
own
actions
,
which
the
patient
was
not
.
There
some
weakly
broke
down
;
sobbed
,
submitted
;
others
,
inspired
by
Heaven
knows
what
intemperate
madness
,
called
Sir
William
to
his
face
a
damnable
humbug
;
questioned
,
even
more
impiously
,
life
itself
.
Why
live
?
they
demanded
.
Sir
William
replied
that
life
was
good
.
Certainly
Lady
Bradshaw
in
ostrich
feathers
hung
over
the
mantelpiece
,
and
as
for
his
income
it
was
quite
twelve
thousand
a
year
.
But
to
us
,
they
protested
,
life
has
given
no
such
bounty
.
He
acquiesced
.
They
lacked
a
sense
of
proportion
.
And
perhaps
,
after
all
,
there
is
no
God
?
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
In
short
,
this
living
or
not
living
is
an
affair
of
our
own
?
But
there
they
were
mistaken
.
Sir
William
had
a
friend
in
Surrey
where
they
taught
,
what
Sir
William
frankly
admitted
was
a
difficult
art
--
a
sense
of
proportion
.
There
were
,
moreover
,
family
affection
;
honour
;
courage
;
and
a
brilliant
career
.
All
of
these
had
in
Sir
William
a
resolute
champion
.
If
they
failed
him
,
he
had
to
support
police
and
the
good
of
society
,
which
,
he
remarked
very
quietly
,
would
take
care
,
down
in
Surrey
,
that
these
unsocial
impulses
,
bred
more
than
anything
by
the
lack
of
good
blood
,
were
held
in
control
.
And
then
stole
out
from
her
hiding-place
and
mounted
her
throne
that
Goddess
whose
lust
is
to
override
opposition
,
to
stamp
indelibly
in
the
sanctuaries
of
others
the
image
of
herself
.
Naked
,
defenceless
,
the
exhausted
,
the
friendless
received
the
impress
of
Sir
William
's
will
.
He
swooped
;
he
devoured
.
He
shut
people
up
.
It
was
this
combination
of
decision
and
humanity
that
endeared
Sir
William
so
greatly
to
the
relations
of
his
victims
.
But
Rezia
Warren
Smith
cried
,
walking
down
Harley
Street
,
that
she
did
not
like
that
man
.
Shredding
and
slicing
,
dividing
and
subdividing
,
the
clocks
of
Harley
Street
nibbled
at
the
June
day
,
counselled
submission
,
upheld
authority
,
and
pointed
out
in
chorus
the
supreme
advantages
of
a
sense
of
proportion
,
until
the
mound
of
time
was
so
far
diminished
that
a
commercial
clock
,
suspended
above
a
shop
in
Oxford
Street
,
announced
,
genially
and
fraternally
,
as
if
it
were
a
pleasure
to
Messrs.
Rigby
and
Lowndes
to
give
the
information
gratis
,
that
it
was
half-past
one
.
Looking
up
,
it
appeared
that
each
letter
of
their
names
stood
for
one
of
the
hours
;
subconsciously
one
was
grateful
to
Rigby
and
Lowndes
for
giving
one
time
ratified
by
Greenwich
;
and
this
gratitude
(
so
Hugh
Whitbread
ruminated
,
dallying
there
in
front
of
the
shop
window
)
,
naturally
took
the
form
later
of
buying
off
Rigby
and
Lowndes
socks
or
shoes
.
So
he
ruminated
.
It
was
his
habit
.
He
did
not
go
deeply
.
He
brushed
surfaces
;
the
dead
languages
,
the
living
,
life
in
Constantinople
,
Paris
,
Rome
;
riding
,
shooting
,
tennis
,
it
had
been
once
.
The
malicious
asserted
that
he
now
kept
guard
at
Buckingham
Palace
,
dressed
in
silk
stockings
and
knee-breeches
,
over
what
nobody
knew
.
But
he
did
it
extremely
efficiently
.
He
had
been
afloat
on
the
cream
of
English
society
for
fifty-five
years
.
He
had
known
Prime
Ministers
.
His
affections
were
understood
to
be
deep
.
And
if
it
were
true
that
he
had
not
taken
part
in
any
of
the
great
movements
of
the
time
or
held
important
office
,
one
or
two
humble
reforms
stood
to
his
credit
;
an
improvement
in
public
shelters
was
one
;
the
protection
of
owls
in
Norfolk
another
;
servant
girls
had
reason
to
be
grateful
to
him
;
and
his
name
at
the
end
of
letters
to
the
Times
,
asking
for
funds
,
appealing
to
the
public
to
protect
,
to
preserve
,
to
clear
up
litter
,
to
abate
smoke
,
and
stamp
out
immorality
in
parks
,
commanded
respect
.
A
magnificent
figure
he
cut
too
,
pausing
for
a
moment
(
as
the
sound
of
the
half
hour
died
away
)
to
look
critically
,
magisterially
,
at
socks
and
shoes
;
impeccable
,
substantial
,
as
if
he
beheld
the
world
from
a
certain
eminence
,
and
dressed
to
match
;
but
realised
the
obligations
which
size
,
wealth
,
health
,
entail
,
and
observed
punctiliously
even
when
not
absolutely
necessary
,
little
courtesies
,
old-fashioned
ceremonies
which
gave
a
quality
to
his
manner
,
something
to
imitate
,
something
to
remember
him
by
,
for
he
would
never
lunch
,
for
example
,
with
Lady
Bruton
,
whom
he
had
known
these
twenty
years
,
without
bringing
her
in
his
outstretched
hand
a
bunch
of
carnations
and
asking
Miss
Brush
,
Lady
Bruton
's
secretary
,
after
her
brother
in
South
Africa
,
which
,
for
some
reason
,
Miss
Brush
,
deficient
though
she
was
in
every
attribute
of
female
charm
,
so
much
resented
that
she
said
``
Thank
you
,
he
's
doing
very
well
in
South
Africa
,
''
when
,
for
half
a
dozen
years
,
he
had
been
doing
badly
in
Portsmouth
.
Lady
Bruton
herself
preferred
Richard
Dalloway
,
who
arrived
at
the
next
moment
.
Indeed
they
met
on
the
doorstep
.
Lady
Bruton
preferred
Richard
Dalloway
of
course
.
He
was
made
of
much
finer
material
.
But
she
would
n't
let
them
run
down
her
poor
dear
Hugh
.
She
could
never
forget
his
kindness
--
he
had
been
really
remarkably
kind
--
she
forgot
precisely
upon
what
occasion
.
But
he
had
been
--
remarkably
kind
.
Anyhow
,
the
difference
between
one
man
and
another
does
not
amount
to
much
.
She
had
never
seen
the
sense
of
cutting
people
up
,
as
Clarissa
Dalloway
did
--
cutting
them
up
and
sticking
them
together
again
;
not
at
any
rate
when
one
was
sixty-two
.
She
took
Hugh
's
carnations
with
her
angular
grim
smile
.
There
was
nobody
else
coming
,
she
said
.
She
had
got
them
there
on
false
pretences
,
to
help
her
out
of
a
difficulty
--
``
But
let
us
eat
first
,
''
she
said
.
And
so
there
began
a
soundless
and
exquisite
passing
to
and
fro
through
swing
doors
of
aproned
white-capped
maids
,
handmaidens
not
of
necessity
,
but
adepts
in
a
mystery
or
grand
deception
practised
by
hostesses
in
Mayfair
from
one-thirty
to
two
,
when
,
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
,
the
traffic
ceases
,
and
there
rises
instead
this
profound
illusion
in
the
first
place
about
the
food
--
how
it
is
not
paid
for
;
and
then
that
the
table
spreads
itself
voluntarily
with
glass
and
silver
,
little
mats
,
saucers
of
red
fruit
;
films
of
brown
cream
mask
turbot
;
in
casseroles
severed
chickens
swim
;
coloured
,
undomestic
,
the
fire
burns
;
and
with
the
wine
and
the
coffee
(
not
paid
for
)
rise
jocund
visions
before
musing
eyes
;
gently
speculative
eyes
;
eyes
to
whom
life
appears
musical
,
mysterious
;
eyes
now
kindled
to
observe
genially
the
beauty
of
the
red
carnations
which
Lady
Bruton
(
whose
movements
were
always
angular
)
had
laid
beside
her
plate
,
so
that
Hugh
Whitbread
,
feeling
at
peace
with
the
entire
universe
and
at
the
same
time
completely
sure
of
his
standing
,
said
,
resting
his
fork
,
``
Would
n't
they
look
charming
against
your
lace
?
''
Miss
Brush
resented
this
familiarity
intensely
.
She
thought
him
an
underbred
fellow
.
She
made
Lady
Bruton
laugh
.
Lady
Bruton
raised
the
carnations
,
holding
them
rather
stiffly
with
much
the
same
attitude
with
which
the
General
held
the
scroll
in
the
picture
behind
her
;
she
remained
fixed
,
tranced
.
Which
was
she
now
,
the
General
's
great-grand-daughter
?
great-great-grand-daughter
?
Richard
Dalloway
asked
himself
.
Sir
Roderick
,
Sir
Miles
,
Sir
Talbot
--
that
was
it
.
It
was
remarkable
how
in
that
family
the
likeness
persisted
in
the
women
.
She
should
have
been
a
general
of
dragoons
herself
.
And
Richard
would
have
served
under
her
,
cheerfully
;
he
had
the
greatest
respect
for
her
;
he
cherished
these
romantic
views
about
well-set-up
old
women
of
pedigree
,
and
would
have
liked
,
in
his
good-humoured
way
,
to
bring
some
young
hot-heads
of
his
acquaintance
to
lunch
with
her
;
as
if
a
type
like
hers
could
be
bred
of
amiable
tea-drinking
enthusiasts
!
He
knew
her
country
.
He
knew
her
people
.
There
was
a
vine
,
still
bearing
,
which
either
Lovelace
or
Herrick
--
she
never
read
a
word
poetry
of
herself
,
but
so
the
story
ran
--
had
sat
under
.
Better
wait
to
put
before
them
the
question
that
bothered
her
(
about
making
an
appeal
to
the
public
;
if
so
,
in
what
terms
and
so
on
)
,
better
wait
until
they
have
had
their
coffee
,
Lady
Bruton
thought
;
and
so
laid
the
carnations
down
beside
her
plate
.
``
How
's
Clarissa
?
''
she
asked
abruptly
.
Clarissa
always
said
that
Lady
Bruton
did
not
like
her
.
Indeed
,
Lady
Bruton
had
the
reputation
of
being
more
interested
in
politics
than
people
;
of
talking
like
a
man
;
of
having
had
a
finger
in
some
notorious
intrigue
of
the
eighties
,
which
was
now
beginning
to
be
mentioned
in
memoirs
.
Certainly
there
was
an
alcove
in
her
drawing-room
,
and
a
table
in
that
alcove
,
and
a
photograph
upon
that
table
of
General
Sir
Talbot
Moore
,
now
deceased
,
who
had
written
there
(
one
evening
in
the
eighties
)
in
Lady
Bruton
's
presence
,
with
her
cognisance
,
perhaps
advice
,
a
telegram
ordering
the
British
troops
to
advance
upon
an
historical
occasion
.
(
She
kept
the
pen
and
told
the
story
.
)
Thus
,
when
she
said
in
her
offhand
way
``
How
's
Clarissa
?
''
husbands
had
difficulty
in
persuading
their
wives
and
indeed
,
however
devoted
,
were
secretly
doubtful
themselves
,
of
her
interest
in
women
who
often
got
in
their
husbands
'
way
,
prevented
them
from
accepting
posts
abroad
,
and
had
to
be
taken
to
the
seaside
in
the
middle
of
the
session
to
recover
from
influenza
.
Nevertheless
her
inquiry
,
``
How
's
Clarissa
?
''
was
known
by
women
infallibly
,
to
be
a
signal
from
a
well-wisher
,
from
an
almost
silent
companion
,
whose
utterances
(
half
a
dozen
perhaps
in
the
course
of
a
lifetime
)
signified
recognition
of
some
feminine
comradeship
which
went
beneath
masculine
lunch
parties
and
united
Lady
Bruton
and
Mrs.
Dalloway
,
who
seldom
met
,
and
appeared
when
they
did
meet
indifferent
and
even
hostile
,
in
a
singular
bond
.
``
I
met
Clarissa
in
the
Park
this
morning
,
''
said
Hugh
Whitbread
,
diving
into
the
casserole
,
anxious
to
pay
himself
this
little
tribute
,
for
he
had
only
to
come
to
London
and
he
met
everybody
at
once
;
but
greedy
,
one
of
the
greediest
men
she
had
ever
known
,
Milly
Brush
thought
,
who
observed
men
with
unflinching
rectitude
,
and
was
capable
of
everlasting
devotion
,
to
her
own
sex
in
particular
,
being
knobbed
,
scraped
,
angular
,
and
entirely
without
feminine
charm
.
``
D'you
know
who
's
in
town
?
''
said
Lady
Bruton
suddenly
bethinking
her
.
``
Our
old
friend
,
Peter
Walsh
.
''
They
all
smiled
.
Peter
Walsh
!
And
Mr.
Dalloway
was
genuinely
glad
,
Milly
Brush
thought
;
and
Mr.
Whitbread
thought
only
of
his
chicken
.
Peter
Walsh
!
All
three
,
Lady
Bruton
,
Hugh
Whitbread
,
and
Richard
Dalloway
,
remembered
the
same
thing
--
how
passionately
Peter
had
been
in
love
;
been
rejected
;
gone
to
India
;
come
a
cropper
;
made
a
mess
of
things
;
and
Richard
Dalloway
had
a
very
great
liking
for
the
dear
old
fellow
too
.
Milly
Brush
saw
that
;
saw
a
depth
in
the
brown
of
his
eyes
;
saw
him
hesitate
;
consider
;
which
interested
her
,
as
Mr.
Dalloway
always
interested
her
,
for
what
was
he
thinking
,
she
wondered
,
about
Peter
Walsh
?
That
Peter
Walsh
had
been
in
love
with
Clarissa
;
that
he
would
go
back
directly
after
lunch
and
find
Clarissa
;
that
he
would
tell
her
,
in
so
many
words
,
that
he
loved
her
.
Yes
,
he
would
say
that
.
Milly
Brush
once
might
almost
have
fallen
in
love
with
these
silences
;
and
Mr.
Dalloway
was
always
so
dependable
;
such
a
gentleman
too
.
Now
,
being
forty
,
Lady
Bruton
had
only
to
nod
,
or
turn
her
head
a
little
abruptly
,
and
Milly
Brush
took
the
signal
,
however
deeply
she
might
be
sunk
in
these
reflections
of
a
detached
spirit
,
of
an
uncorrupted
soul
whom
life
could
not
bamboozle
,
because
life
had
not
offered
her
a
trinket
of
the
slightest
value
;
not
a
curl
,
smile
,
lip
,
cheek
,
nose
;
nothing
whatever
;
Lady
Bruton
had
only
to
nod
,
and
Perkins
was
instructed
to
quicken
the
coffee
.
``
Yes
;
Peter
Walsh
has
come
back
,
''
said
Lady
Bruton
.
It
was
vaguely
flattering
to
them
all
.
He
had
come
back
,
battered
,
unsuccessful
,
to
their
secure
shores
.
But
to
help
him
,
they
reflected
,
was
impossible
;
there
was
some
flaw
in
his
character
.
Hugh
Whitbread
said
one
might
of
course
mention
his
name
to
So-and-so
.
He
wrinkled
lugubriously
,
consequentially
,
at
the
thought
of
the
letters
he
would
write
to
the
heads
of
Government
offices
about
``
my
old
friend
,
Peter
Walsh
,
''
and
so
on
.
But
it
would
n't
lead
to
anything
--
not
to
anything
permanent
,
because
of
his
character
.
``
In
trouble
with
some
woman
,
''
said
Lady
Bruton
.
They
had
all
guessed
that
that
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
``
However
,
''
said
Lady
Bruton
,
anxious
to
leave
the
subject
,
``
we
shall
hear
the
whole
story
from
Peter
himself
.
''
(
The
coffee
was
very
slow
in
coming
.
)
``
The
address
?
''
murmured
Hugh
Whitbread
;
and
there
was
at
once
a
ripple
in
the
grey
tide
of
service
which
washed
round
Lady
Bruton
day
in
,
day
out
,
collecting
,
intercepting
,
enveloping
her
in
a
fine
tissue
which
broke
concussions
,
mitigated
interruptions
,
and
spread
round
the
house
in
Brook
Street
a
fine
net
where
things
lodged
and
were
picked
out
accurately
,
instantly
,
by
grey-haired
Perkins
,
who
had
been
with
Lady
Bruton
these
thirty
years
and
now
wrote
down
the
address
;
handed
it
to
Mr.
Whitbread
,
who
took
out
his
pocket-book
,
raised
his
eyebrows
,
and
slipping
it
in
among
documents
of
the
highest
importance
,
said
that
he
would
get
Evelyn
to
ask
him
to
lunch
.
(
They
were
waiting
to
bring
the
coffee
until
Mr.
Whitbread
had
finished
.
)
Hugh
was
very
slow
,
Lady
Bruton
thought
.
He
was
getting
fat
,
she
noticed
.
Richard
always
kept
himself
in
the
pink
of
condition
.
She
was
getting
impatient
;
the
whole
of
her
being
was
setting
positively
,
undeniably
,
domineeringly
brushing
aside
all
this
unnecessary
trifling
(
Peter
Walsh
and
his
affairs
)
upon
that
subject
which
engaged
her
attention
,
and
not
merely
her
attention
,
but
that
fibre
which
was
the
ramrod
of
her
soul
,
that
essential
part
of
her
without
which
Millicent
Bruton
would
not
have
been
Millicent
Bruton
;
that
project
for
emigrating
young
people
of
both
sexes
born
of
respectable
parents
and
setting
them
up
with
a
fair
prospect
of
doing
well
in
Canada
.
She
exaggerated
.
She
had
perhaps
lost
her
sense
of
proportion
.
Emigration
was
not
to
others
the
obvious
remedy
,
the
sublime
conception
.
It
was
not
to
them
(
not
to
Hugh
,
or
Richard
,
or
even
to
devoted
Miss
Brush
)
the
liberator
of
the
pent
egotism
,
which
a
strong
martial
woman
,
well
nourished
,
well
descended
,
of
direct
impulses
,
downright
feelings
,
and
little
introspective
power
(
broad
and
simple
--
why
could
not
every
one
be
broad
and
simple
?
she
asked
)
feels
rise
within
her
,
once
youth
is
past
,
and
must
eject
upon
some
object
--
it
may
be
Emigration
,
it
may
be
Emancipation
;
but
whatever
it
be
,
this
object
round
which
the
essence
of
her
soul
is
daily
secreted
,
becomes
inevitably
prismatic
,
lustrous
,
half
looking-glass
,
half
precious
stone
;
now
carefully
hidden
in
case
people
should
sneer
at
it
;
now
proudly
displayed
.
Emigration
had
become
,
in
short
,
largely
Lady
Bruton
.
But
she
had
to
write
.
And
one
letter
to
the
Times
,
she
used
to
say
to
Miss
Brush
,
cost
her
more
than
to
organise
an
expedition
to
South
Africa
(
which
she
had
done
in
the
war
)
.
After
a
morning
's
battle
beginning
,
tearing
up
,
beginning
again
,
she
used
to
feel
the
futility
of
her
own
womanhood
as
she
felt
it
on
no
other
occasion
,
and
would
turn
gratefully
to
the
thought
of
Hugh
Whitbread
who
possessed
--
no
one
could
doubt
it
--
the
art
of
writing
letters
to
the
Times
.
A
being
so
differently
constituted
from
herself
,
with
such
a
command
of
language
;
able
to
put
things
as
editors
like
them
put
;
had
passions
which
one
could
not
call
simply
greed
.
Lady
Bruton
often
suspended
judgement
upon
men
in
deference
to
the
mysterious
accord
in
which
they
,
but
no
woman
,
stood
to
the
laws
of
the
universe
;
knew
how
to
put
things
;
knew
what
was
said
;
so
that
if
Richard
advised
her
,
and
Hugh
wrote
for
her
,
she
was
sure
of
being
somehow
right
.
So
she
let
Hugh
eat
his
soufflé
;
asked
after
poor
Evelyn
;
waited
until
they
were
smoking
,
and
then
said
,
``
Milly
,
would
you
fetch
the
papers
?
''
And
Miss
Brush
went
out
,
came
back
;
laid
papers
on
the
table
;
and
Hugh
produced
his
fountain
pen
;
his
silver
fountain
pen
,
which
had
done
twenty
years
'
service
,
he
said
,
unscrewing
the
cap
.
It
was
still
in
perfect
order
;
he
had
shown
it
to
the
makers
;
there
was
no
reason
,
they
said
,
why
it
should
ever
wear
out
;
which
was
somehow
to
Hugh
's
credit
,
and
to
the
credit
of
the
sentiments
which
his
pen
expressed
(
so
Richard
Dalloway
felt
)
as
Hugh
began
carefully
writing
capital
letters
with
rings
round
them
in
the
margin
,
and
thus
marvellously
reduced
Lady
Bruton
's
tangles
to
sense
,
to
grammar
such
as
the
editor
of
the
Times
,
Lady
Bruton
felt
,
watching
the
marvellous
transformation
,
must
respect
.
Hugh
was
slow
.
Hugh
was
pertinacious
.
Richard
said
one
must
take
risks
.
Hugh
proposed
modifications
in
deference
to
people
's
feelings
,
which
,
he
said
rather
tartly
when
Richard
laughed
,
``
had
to
be
considered
,
''
and
read
out
``
how
,
therefore
,
we
are
of
opinion
that
the
times
are
ripe
.
.
.
the
superfluous
youth
of
our
ever-increasing
population
.
.
.
what
we
owe
to
the
dead
.
.
.
''
which
Richard
thought
all
stuffing
and
bunkum
,
but
no
harm
in
it
,
of
course
,
and
Hugh
went
on
drafting
sentiments
in
alphabetical
order
of
the
highest
nobility
,
brushing
the
cigar
ash
from
his
waistcoat
,
and
summing
up
now
and
then
the
progress
they
had
made
until
,
finally
,
he
read
out
the
draft
of
a
letter
which
Lady
Bruton
felt
certain
was
a
masterpiece
.
Could
her
own
meaning
sound
like
that
?
Hugh
could
not
guarantee
that
the
editor
would
put
it
in
;
but
he
would
be
meeting
somebody
at
luncheon
.
Whereupon
Lady
Bruton
,
who
seldom
did
a
graceful
thing
,
stuffed
all
Hugh
's
carnations
into
the
front
of
her
dress
,
and
flinging
her
hands
out
called
him
``
My
Prime
Minister
!
''
What
she
would
have
done
without
them
both
she
did
not
know
.
They
rose
.
And
Richard
Dalloway
strolled
off
as
usual
to
have
a
look
at
the
General
's
portrait
,
because
he
meant
,
whenever
he
had
a
moment
of
leisure
,
to
write
a
history
of
Lady
Bruton
's
family
.
And
Millicent
Bruton
was
very
proud
of
her
family
.
But
they
could
wait
,
they
could
wait
,
she
said
,
looking
at
the
picture
;
meaning
that
her
family
,
of
military
men
,
administrators
,
admirals
,
had
been
men
of
action
,
who
had
done
their
duty
;
and
Richard
's
first
duty
was
to
his
country
,
but
it
was
a
fine
face
,
she
said
;
and
all
the
papers
were
ready
for
Richard
down
at
Aldmixton
whenever
the
time
came
;
the
Labour
Government
she
meant
.
``
Ah
,
the
news
from
India
!
''
she
cried
.
And
then
,
as
they
stood
in
the
hall
taking
yellow
gloves
from
the
bowl
on
the
malachite
table
and
Hugh
was
offering
Miss
Brush
with
quite
unnecessary
courtesy
some
discarded
ticket
or
other
compliment
,
which
she
loathed
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
and
blushed
brick
red
,
Richard
turned
to
Lady
Bruton
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
and
said
,
``
We
shall
see
you
at
our
party
to-night
?
''
whereupon
Lady
Bruton
resumed
the
magnificence
which
letter-writing
had
shattered
.
She
might
come
;
or
she
might
not
come
.
Clarissa
had
wonderful
energy
.
Parties
terrified
Lady
Bruton
.
But
then
,
she
was
getting
old
.
So
she
intimated
,
standing
at
her
doorway
;
handsome
;
very
erect
;
while
her
chow
stretched
behind
her
,
and
Miss
Brush
disappeared
into
the
background
with
her
hands
full
of
papers
.
And
Lady
Bruton
went
ponderously
,
majestically
,
up
to
her
room
,
lay
,
one
arm
extended
,
on
the
sofa
.
She
sighed
,
she
snored
,
not
that
she
was
asleep
,
only
drowsy
and
heavy
,
drowsy
and
heavy
,
like
a
field
of
clover
in
the
sunshine
this
hot
June
day
,
with
the
bees
going
round
and
about
and
the
yellow
butterflies
.
Always
she
went
back
to
those
fields
down
in
Devonshire
,
where
she
had
jumped
the
brooks
on
Patty
,
her
pony
,
with
Mortimer
and
Tom
,
her
brothers
.
And
there
were
the
dogs
;
there
were
the
rats
;
there
were
her
father
and
mother
on
the
lawn
under
the
trees
,
with
the
tea-things
out
,
and
the
beds
of
dahlias
,
the
hollyhocks
,
the
pampas
grass
;
and
they
,
little
wretches
,
always
up
to
some
mischief
!
stealing
back
through
the
shrubbery
,
so
as
not
to
be
seen
,
all
bedraggled
from
some
roguery
.
What
old
nurse
used
to
say
about
her
frocks
!
Ah
dear
,
she
remembered
--
it
was
Wednesday
in
Brook
Street
.
Those
kind
good
fellows
,
Richard
Dalloway
,
Hugh
Whitbread
,
had
gone
this
hot
day
through
the
streets
whose
growl
came
up
to
her
lying
on
the
sofa
.
Power
was
hers
,
position
,
income
.
She
had
lived
in
the
forefront
of
her
time
.
She
had
had
good
friends
;
known
the
ablest
men
of
her
day
.
Murmuring
London
flowed
up
to
her
,
and
her
hand
,
lying
on
the
sofa
back
,
curled
upon
some
imaginary
baton
such
as
her
grandfathers
might
have
held
,
holding
which
she
seemed
,
drowsy
and
heavy
,
to
be
commanding
battalions
marching
to
Canada
,
and
those
good
fellows
walking
across
London
,
that
territory
of
theirs
,
that
little
bit
of
carpet
,
Mayfair
.
And
they
went
further
and
further
from
her
,
being
attached
to
her
by
a
thin
thread
(
since
they
had
lunched
with
her
)
which
would
stretch
and
stretch
,
get
thinner
and
thinner
as
they
walked
across
London
;
as
if
one
's
friends
were
attached
to
one
's
body
,
after
lunching
with
them
,
by
a
thin
thread
,
which
(
as
she
dozed
there
)
became
hazy
with
the
sound
of
bells
,
striking
the
hour
or
ringing
to
service
,
as
a
single
spider
's
thread
is
blotted
with
rain-drops
,
and
,
burdened
,
sags
down
.
So
she
slept
.
And
Richard
Dalloway
and
Hugh
Whitbread
hesitated
at
the
corner
of
Conduit
Street
at
the
very
moment
that
Millicent
Bruton
,
lying
on
the
sofa
,
let
the
thread
snap
;
snored
.
Contrary
winds
buffeted
at
the
street
corner
.
They
looked
in
at
a
shop
window
;
they
did
not
wish
to
buy
or
to
talk
but
to
part
,
only
with
contrary
winds
buffeting
the
street
corner
,
with
some
sort
of
lapse
in
the
tides
of
the
body
,
two
forces
meeting
in
a
swirl
,
morning
and
afternoon
,
they
paused
.
Some
newspaper
placard
went
up
in
the
air
,
gallantly
,
like
a
kite
at
first
,
then
paused
,
swooped
,
fluttered
;
and
a
lady
's
veil
hung
.
Yellow
awnings
trembled
.
The
speed
of
the
morning
traffic
slackened
,
and
single
carts
rattled
carelessly
down
half-empty
streets
.
In
Norfolk
,
of
which
Richard
Dalloway
was
half
thinking
,
a
soft
warm
wind
blew
back
the
petals
;
confused
the
waters
;
ruffled
the
flowering
grasses
.
Haymakers
,
who
had
pitched
beneath
hedges
to
sleep
away
the
morning
toil
,
parted
curtains
of
green
blades
;
moved
trembling
globes
of
cow
parsley
to
see
the
sky
;
the
blue
,
the
steadfast
,
the
blazing
summer
sky
.
Aware
that
he
was
looking
at
a
silver
two-handled
Jacobean
mug
,
and
that
Hugh
Whitbread
admired
condescendingly
with
airs
of
connoisseurship
a
Spanish
necklace
which
he
thought
of
asking
the
price
of
in
case
Evelyn
might
like
it
--
still
Richard
was
torpid
;
could
not
think
or
move
.
Life
had
thrown
up
this
wreckage
;
shop
windows
full
of
coloured
paste
,
and
one
stood
stark
with
the
lethargy
of
the
old
,
stiff
with
the
rigidity
of
the
old
,
looking
in
.
Evelyn
Whitbread
might
like
to
buy
this
Spanish
necklace
--
so
she
might
.
Yawn
he
must
.
Hugh
was
going
into
the
shop
.
``
Right
you
are
!
''
said
Richard
,
following
.
Goodness
knows
he
did
n't
want
to
go
buying
necklaces
with
Hugh
.
But
there
are
tides
in
the
body
.
Morning
meets
afternoon
.
Borne
like
a
frail
shallop
on
deep
,
deep
floods
,
Lady
Bruton
's
great-grandfather
and
his
memoir
and
his
campaigns
in
North
America
were
whelmed
and
sunk
.
And
Millicent
Bruton
too
.
She
went
under
.
Richard
did
n't
care
a
straw
what
became
of
Emigration
;
about
that
letter
,
whether
the
editor
put
it
in
or
not
.
The
necklace
hung
stretched
between
Hugh
's
admirable
fingers
.
Let
him
give
it
to
a
girl
,
if
he
must
buy
jewels
--
any
girl
,
any
girl
in
the
street
.
For
the
worthlessness
of
this
life
did
strike
Richard
pretty
forcibly
--
buying
necklaces
for
Evelyn
.
If
he
'd
had
a
boy
he
'd
have
said
,
Work
,
work
.
But
he
had
his
Elizabeth
;
he
adored
his
Elizabeth
.
``
I
should
like
to
see
Mr.
Dubonnet
,
''
said
Hugh
in
his
curt
worldly
way
.
It
appeared
that
this
Dubonnet
had
the
measurements
of
Mrs.
Whitbread
's
neck
,
or
,
more
strangely
still
,
knew
her
views
upon
Spanish
jewellery
and
the
extent
of
her
possessions
in
that
line
(
which
Hugh
could
not
remember
)
.
All
of
which
seemed
to
Richard
Dalloway
awfully
odd
.
For
he
never
gave
Clarissa
presents
,
except
a
bracelet
two
or
three
years
ago
,
which
had
not
been
a
success
.
She
never
wore
it
.
It
pained
him
to
remember
that
she
never
wore
it
.
And
as
a
single
spider
's
thread
after
wavering
here
and
there
attaches
itself
to
the
point
of
a
leaf
,
so
Richard
's
mind
,
recovering
from
its
lethargy
,
set
now
on
his
wife
,
Clarissa
,
whom
Peter
Walsh
had
loved
so
passionately
;
and
Richard
had
had
a
sudden
vision
of
her
there
at
luncheon
;
of
himself
and
Clarissa
;
of
their
life
together
;
and
he
drew
the
tray
of
old
jewels
towards
him
,
and
taking
up
first
this
brooch
then
that
ring
,
``
How
much
is
that
?
''
he
asked
,
but
doubted
his
own
taste
.
He
wanted
to
open
the
drawing-room
door
and
come
in
holding
out
something
;
a
present
for
Clarissa
.
Only
what
?
But
Hugh
was
on
his
legs
again
.
He
was
unspeakably
pompous
.
Really
,
after
dealing
here
for
thirty-five
years
he
was
not
going
to
be
put
off
by
a
mere
boy
who
did
not
know
his
business
.
For
Dubonnet
,
it
seemed
,
was
out
,
and
Hugh
would
not
buy
anything
until
Mr.
Dubonnet
chose
to
be
in
;
at
which
the
youth
flushed
and
bowed
his
correct
little
bow
.
It
was
all
perfectly
correct
.
And
yet
Richard
could
n't
have
said
that
to
save
his
life
!
Why
these
people
stood
that
damned
insolence
he
could
not
conceive
.
Hugh
was
becoming
an
intolerable
ass
.
Richard
Dalloway
could
not
stand
more
than
an
hour
of
his
society
.
And
,
flicking
his
bowler
hat
by
way
of
farewell
,
Richard
turned
at
the
corner
of
Conduit
Street
eager
,
yes
,
very
eager
,
to
travel
that
spider
's
thread
of
attachment
between
himself
and
Clarissa
;
he
would
go
straight
to
her
,
in
Westminster
.
But
he
wanted
to
come
in
holding
something
.
Flowers
?
Yes
,
flowers
,
since
he
did
not
trust
his
taste
in
gold
;
any
number
of
flowers
,
roses
,
orchids
,
to
celebrate
what
was
,
reckoning
things
as
you
will
,
an
event
;
this
feeling
about
her
when
they
spoke
of
Peter
Walsh
at
luncheon
;
and
they
never
spoke
of
it
;
not
for
years
had
they
spoken
of
it
;
which
,
he
thought
,
grasping
his
red
and
white
roses
together
(
a
vast
bunch
in
tissue
paper
)
,
is
the
greatest
mistake
in
the
world
.
The
time
comes
when
it
ca
n't
be
said
;
one
's
too
shy
to
say
it
,
he
thought
,
pocketing
his
sixpence
or
two
of
change
,
setting
off
with
his
great
bunch
held
against
his
body
to
Westminster
to
say
straight
out
in
so
many
words
(
whatever
she
might
think
of
him
)
,
holding
out
his
flowers
,
``
I
love
you
.
''
Why
not
?
Really
it
was
a
miracle
thinking
of
the
war
,
and
thousands
of
poor
chaps
,
with
all
their
lives
before
them
,
shovelled
together
,
already
half
forgotten
;
it
was
a
miracle
.
Here
he
was
walking
across
London
to
say
to
Clarissa
in
so
many
words
that
he
loved
her
.
Which
one
never
does
say
,
he
thought
.
Partly
one
's
lazy
;
partly
one
's
shy
.
And
Clarissa
--
it
was
difficult
to
think
of
her
;
except
in
starts
,
as
at
luncheon
,
when
he
saw
her
quite
distinctly
;
their
whole
life
.
He
stopped
at
the
crossing
;
and
repeated
--
being
simple
by
nature
,
and
undebauched
,
because
he
had
tramped
,
and
shot
;
being
pertinacious
and
dogged
,
having
championed
the
down-trodden
and
followed
his
instincts
in
the
House
of
Commons
;
being
preserved
in
his
simplicity
yet
at
the
same
time
grown
rather
speechless
,
rather
stiff
--
he
repeated
that
it
was
a
miracle
that
he
should
have
married
Clarissa
;
a
miracle
--
his
life
had
been
a
miracle
,
he
thought
;
hesitating
to
cross
.
But
it
did
make
his
blood
boil
to
see
little
creatures
of
five
or
six
crossing
Piccadilly
alone
.
The
police
ought
to
have
stopped
the
traffic
at
once
.
He
had
no
illusions
about
the
London
police
.
Indeed
,
he
was
collecting
evidence
of
their
malpractices
;
and
those
costermongers
,
not
allowed
to
stand
their
barrows
in
the
streets
;
and
prostitutes
,
good
Lord
,
the
fault
was
n't
in
them
,
nor
in
young
men
either
,
but
in
our
detestable
social
system
and
so
forth
;
all
of
which
he
considered
,
could
be
seen
considering
,
grey
,
dogged
,
dapper
,
clean
,
as
he
walked
across
the
Park
to
tell
his
wife
that
he
loved
her
.
For
he
would
say
it
in
so
many
words
,
when
he
came
into
the
room
.
Because
it
is
a
thousand
pities
never
to
say
what
one
feels
,
he
thought
,
crossing
the
Green
Park
and
observing
with
pleasure
how
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
whole
families
,
poor
families
,
were
sprawling
;
children
kicking
up
their
legs
;
sucking
milk
;
paper
bags
thrown
about
,
which
could
easily
be
picked
up
(
if
people
objected
)
by
one
of
those
fat
gentlemen
in
livery
;
for
he
was
of
opinion
that
every
park
,
and
every
square
,
during
the
summer
months
should
be
open
to
children
(
the
grass
of
the
park
flushed
and
faded
,
lighting
up
the
poor
mothers
of
Westminster
and
their
crawling
babies
,
as
if
a
yellow
lamp
were
moved
beneath
)
.
But
what
could
be
done
for
female
vagrants
like
that
poor
creature
,
stretched
on
her
elbow
(
as
if
she
had
flung
herself
on
the
earth
,
rid
of
all
ties
,
to
observe
curiously
,
to
speculate
boldly
,
to
consider
the
whys
and
the
wherefores
,
impudent
,
loose-lipped
,
humorous
)
,
he
did
not
know
.
Bearing
his
flowers
like
a
weapon
,
Richard
Dalloway
approached
her
;
intent
he
passed
her
;
still
there
was
time
for
a
spark
between
them
--
she
laughed
at
the
sight
of
him
,
he
smiled
good-humouredly
,
considering
the
problem
of
the
female
vagrant
;
not
that
they
would
ever
speak
.
But
he
would
tell
Clarissa
that
he
loved
her
,
in
so
many
words
.
He
had
,
once
upon
a
time
,
been
jealous
of
Peter
Walsh
;
jealous
of
him
and
Clarissa
.
But
she
had
often
said
to
him
that
she
had
been
right
not
to
marry
Peter
Walsh
;
which
,
knowing
Clarissa
,
was
obviously
true
;
she
wanted
support
.
Not
that
she
was
weak
;
but
she
wanted
support
.
As
for
Buckingham
Palace
(
like
an
old
prima
donna
facing
the
audience
all
in
white
)
you
ca
n't
deny
it
a
certain
dignity
,
he
considered
,
nor
despise
what
does
,
after
all
,
stand
to
millions
of
people
(
a
little
crowd
was
waiting
at
the
gate
to
see
the
King
drive
out
)
for
a
symbol
,
absurd
though
it
is
;
a
child
with
a
box
of
bricks
could
have
done
better
,
he
thought
;
looking
at
the
memorial
to
Queen
Victoria
(
whom
he
could
remember
in
her
horn
spectacles
driving
through
Kensington
)
,
its
white
mound
,
its
billowing
motherliness
;
but
he
liked
being
ruled
by
the
descendant
of
Horsa
;
he
liked
continuity
;
and
the
sense
of
handing
on
the
traditions
of
the
past
.
It
was
a
great
age
in
which
to
have
lived
.
Indeed
,
his
own
life
was
a
miracle
;
let
him
make
no
mistake
about
it
;
here
he
was
,
in
the
prime
of
life
,
walking
to
his
house
in
Westminster
to
tell
Clarissa
that
he
loved
her
.
Happiness
is
this
he
thought
.
It
is
this
,
he
said
,
as
he
entered
Dean
's
Yard
.
Big
Ben
was
beginning
to
strike
,
first
the
warning
,
musical
;
then
the
hour
,
irrevocable
.
Lunch
parties
waste
the
entire
afternoon
,
he
thought
,
approaching
his
door
.
The
sound
of
Big
Ben
flooded
Clarissa
's
drawing-room
,
where
she
sat
,
ever
so
annoyed
,
at
her
writing-table
;
worried
;
annoyed
.
It
was
perfectly
true
that
she
had
not
asked
Ellie
Henderson
to
her
party
;
but
she
had
done
it
on
purpose
.
Now
Mrs.
Marsham
wrote
``
she
had
told
Ellie
Henderson
she
would
ask
Clarissa
--
Ellie
so
much
wanted
to
come
.
''
But
why
should
she
invite
all
the
dull
women
in
London
to
her
parties
?
Why
should
Mrs.
Marsham
interfere
?
And
there
was
Elizabeth
closeted
all
this
time
with
Doris
Kilman
.
Anything
more
nauseating
she
could
not
conceive
.
Prayer
at
this
hour
with
that
woman
.
And
the
sound
of
the
bell
flooded
the
room
with
its
melancholy
wave
;
which
receded
,
and
gathered
itself
together
to
fall
once
more
,
when
she
heard
,
distractingly
,
something
fumbling
,
something
scratching
at
the
door
.
Who
at
this
hour
?
Three
,
good
Heavens
!
Three
already
!
For
with
overpowering
directness
and
dignity
the
clock
struck
three
;
and
she
heard
nothing
else
;
but
the
door
handle
slipped
round
and
in
came
Richard
!
What
a
surprise
!
In
came
Richard
,
holding
out
flowers
.
She
had
failed
him
,
once
at
Constantinople
;
and
Lady
Bruton
,
whose
lunch
parties
were
said
to
be
extraordinarily
amusing
,
had
not
asked
her
.
He
was
holding
out
flowers
--
roses
,
red
and
white
roses
.
(
But
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
say
he
loved
her
;
not
in
so
many
words
.
)
But
how
lovely
,
she
said
,
taking
his
flowers
.
She
understood
;
she
understood
without
his
speaking
;
his
Clarissa
.
She
put
them
in
vases
on
the
mantelpiece
.
How
lovely
they
looked
!
she
said
.
And
was
it
amusing
,
she
asked
?
Had
Lady
Bruton
asked
after
her
?
Peter
Walsh
was
back
.
Mrs.
Marsham
had
written
.
Must
she
ask
Ellie
Henderson
?
That
woman
Kilman
was
upstairs
.
``
But
let
us
sit
down
for
five
minutes
,
''
said
Richard
.
It
all
looked
so
empty
.
All
the
chairs
were
against
the
wall
.
What
had
they
been
doing
?
Oh
,
it
was
for
the
party
;
no
,
he
had
not
forgotten
,
the
party
.
Peter
Walsh
was
back
.
Oh
yes
;
she
had
had
him
.
And
he
was
going
to
get
a
divorce
;
and
he
was
in
love
with
some
woman
out
there
.
And
he
had
n't
changed
in
the
slightest
.
There
she
was
,
mending
her
dress
.
.
.
.
``
Thinking
of
Bourton
,
''
she
said
.
``
Hugh
was
at
lunch
,
''
said
Richard
.
She
had
met
him
too
!
Well
,
he
was
getting
absolutely
intolerable
.
Buying
Evelyn
necklaces
;
fatter
than
ever
;
an
intolerable
ass
.
``
And
it
came
over
me
'I
might
have
married
you
,
'
''
she
said
,
thinking
of
Peter
sitting
there
in
his
little
bow-tie
;
with
that
knife
,
opening
it
,
shutting
it
.
``
Just
as
he
always
was
,
you
know
.
''
They
were
talking
about
him
at
lunch
,
said
Richard
.
(
But
he
could
not
tell
her
he
loved
her
.
He
held
her
hand
.
Happiness
is
this
,
he
thought
.
)
They
had
been
writing
a
letter
to
the
Times
for
Millicent
Bruton
.
That
was
about
all
Hugh
was
fit
for
.
``
And
our
dear
Miss
Kilman
?
''
he
asked
.
Clarissa
thought
the
roses
absolutely
lovely
;
first
bunched
together
;
now
of
their
own
accord
starting
apart
.
``
Kilman
arrives
just
as
we
've
done
lunch
,
''
she
said
.
``
Elizabeth
turns
pink
.
They
shut
themselves
up
.
I
suppose
they
're
praying
.
''
Lord
!
He
did
n't
like
it
;
but
these
things
pass
over
if
you
let
them
.
``
In
a
mackintosh
with
an
umbrella
,
''
said
Clarissa
.
He
had
not
said
``
I
love
you
''
;
but
he
held
her
hand
.
Happiness
is
this
,
is
this
,
he
thought
.
``
But
why
should
I
ask
all
the
dull
women
in
London
to
my
parties
?
''
said
Clarissa
.
And
if
Mrs.
Marsham
gave
a
party
,
did
she
invite
her
guests
?
``
Poor
Ellie
Henderson
,
''
said
Richard
--
it
was
a
very
odd
thing
how
much
Clarissa
minded
about
her
parties
,
he
thought
.
But
Richard
had
no
notion
of
the
look
of
a
room
.
However
--
what
was
he
going
to
say
?
If
she
worried
about
these
parties
he
would
not
let
her
give
them
.
Did
she
wish
she
had
married
Peter
?
But
he
must
go
.
He
must
be
off
,
he
said
,
getting
up
.
But
he
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
about
to
say
something
;
and
she
wondered
what
?
Why
?
There
were
the
roses
.
``
Some
Committee
?
''
she
asked
,
as
he
opened
the
door
.
``
Armenians
,
''
he
said
;
or
perhaps
it
was
``
Albanians
.
''
And
there
is
a
dignity
in
people
;
a
solitude
;
even
between
husband
and
wife
a
gulf
;
and
that
one
must
respect
,
thought
Clarissa
,
watching
him
open
the
door
;
for
one
would
not
part
with
it
oneself
,
or
take
it
,
against
his
will
,
from
one
's
husband
,
without
losing
one
's
independence
,
one
's
self-respect
--
something
,
after
all
,
priceless
.
He
returned
with
a
pillow
and
a
quilt
.
``
An
hour
's
complete
rest
after
luncheon
,
''
he
said
.
And
he
went
.
How
like
him
!
He
would
go
on
saying
``
An
hour
's
complete
rest
after
luncheon
''
to
the
end
of
time
,
because
a
doctor
had
ordered
it
once
.
It
was
like
him
to
take
what
doctors
said
literally
;
part
of
his
adorable
,
divine
simplicity
,
which
no
one
had
to
the
same
extent
;
which
made
him
go
and
do
the
thing
while
she
and
Peter
frittered
their
time
away
bickering
.
He
was
already
halfway
to
the
House
of
Commons
,
to
his
Armenians
,
his
Albanians
,
having
settled
her
on
the
sofa
,
looking
at
his
roses
.
And
people
would
say
,
``
Clarissa
Dalloway
is
spoilt
.
''
She
cared
much
more
for
her
roses
than
for
the
Armenians
.
Hunted
out
of
existence
,
maimed
,
frozen
,
the
victims
of
cruelty
and
injustice
(
she
had
heard
Richard
say
so
over
and
over
again
)
--
no
,
she
could
feel
nothing
for
the
Albanians
,
or
was
it
the
Armenians
?
but
she
loved
her
roses
(
did
n't
that
help
the
Armenians
?
)
--
the
only
flowers
she
could
bear
to
see
cut
.
But
Richard
was
already
at
the
House
of
Commons
;
at
his
Committee
,
having
settled
all
her
difficulties
.
But
no
;
alas
,
that
was
not
true
.
He
did
not
see
the
reasons
against
asking
Ellie
Henderson
.
She
would
do
it
,
of
course
,
as
he
wished
it
.
Since
he
had
brought
the
pillows
,
she
would
lie
down
.
.
.
.
But
--
but
--
why
did
she
suddenly
feel
,
for
no
reason
that
she
could
discover
,
desperately
unhappy
?
As
a
person
who
has
dropped
some
grain
of
pearl
or
diamond
into
the
grass
and
parts
the
tall
blades
very
carefully
,
this
way
and
that
,
and
searches
here
and
there
vainly
,
and
at
last
spies
it
there
at
the
roots
,
so
she
went
through
one
thing
and
another
;
no
,
it
was
not
Sally
Seton
saying
that
Richard
would
never
be
in
the
Cabinet
because
he
had
a
second-class
brain
(
it
came
back
to
her
)
;
no
,
she
did
not
mind
that
;
nor
was
it
to
do
with
Elizabeth
either
and
Doris
Kilman
;
those
were
facts
.
It
was
a
feeling
,
some
unpleasant
feeling
,
earlier
in
the
day
perhaps
;
something
that
Peter
had
said
,
combined
with
some
depression
of
her
own
,
in
her
bedroom
,
taking
off
her
hat
;
and
what
Richard
had
said
had
added
to
it
,
but
what
had
he
said
?
There
were
his
roses
.
Her
parties
!
That
was
it
!
Her
parties
!
Both
of
them
criticised
her
very
unfairly
,
laughed
at
her
very
unjustly
,
for
her
parties
.
That
was
it
!
That
was
it
!
Well
,
how
was
she
going
to
defend
herself
?
Now
that
she
knew
what
it
was
,
she
felt
perfectly
happy
.
They
thought
,
or
Peter
at
any
rate
thought
,
that
she
enjoyed
imposing
herself
;
liked
to
have
famous
people
about
her
;
great
names
;
was
simply
a
snob
in
short
.
Well
,
Peter
might
think
so
.
Richard
merely
thought
it
foolish
of
her
to
like
excitement
when
she
knew
it
was
bad
for
her
heart
.
It
was
childish
,
he
thought
.
And
both
were
quite
wrong
.
What
she
liked
was
simply
life
.
``
That
's
what
I
do
it
for
,
''
she
said
,
speaking
aloud
,
to
life
.
Since
she
was
lying
on
the
sofa
,
cloistered
,
exempt
,
the
presence
of
this
thing
which
she
felt
to
be
so
obvious
became
physically
existent
;
with
robes
of
sound
from
the
street
,
sunny
,
with
hot
breath
,
whispering
,
blowing
out
the
blinds
.
But
suppose
Peter
said
to
her
,
``
Yes
,
yes
,
but
your
parties
--
what
's
the
sense
of
your
parties
?
''
all
she
could
say
was
(
and
nobody
could
be
expected
to
understand
)
:
They
're
an
offering
;
which
sounded
horribly
vague
.
But
who
was
Peter
to
make
out
that
life
was
all
plain
sailing
?
--
Peter
always
in
love
,
always
in
love
with
the
wrong
woman
?
What
's
your
love
?
she
might
say
to
him
.
And
she
knew
his
answer
;
how
it
is
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
and
no
woman
possibly
understood
it
.
Very
well
.
But
could
any
man
understand
what
she
meant
either
?
about
life
?
She
could
not
imagine
Peter
or
Richard
taking
the
trouble
to
give
a
party
for
no
reason
whatever
.
But
to
go
deeper
,
beneath
what
people
said
(
and
these
judgements
,
how
superficial
,
how
fragmentary
they
are
!
)
in
her
own
mind
now
,
what
did
it
mean
to
her
,
this
thing
she
called
life
?
Oh
,
it
was
very
queer
.
Here
was
So-and-so
in
South
Kensington
;
some
one
up
in
Bayswater
;
and
somebody
else
,
say
,
in
Mayfair
.
And
she
felt
quite
continuously
a
sense
of
their
existence
;
and
she
felt
what
a
waste
;
and
she
felt
what
a
pity
;
and
she
felt
if
only
they
could
be
brought
together
;
so
she
did
it
.
And
it
was
an
offering
;
to
combine
,
to
create
;
but
to
whom
?
An
offering
for
the
sake
of
offering
,
perhaps
.
Anyhow
,
it
was
her
gift
.
Nothing
else
had
she
of
the
slightest
importance
;
could
not
think
,
write
,
even
play
the
piano
.
She
muddled
Armenians
and
Turks
;
loved
success
;
hated
discomfort
;
must
be
liked
;
talked
oceans
of
nonsense
:
and
to
this
day
,
ask
her
what
the
Equator
was
,
and
she
did
not
know
.
All
the
same
,
that
one
day
should
follow
another
;
Wednesday
,
Thursday
,
Friday
,
Saturday
;
that
one
should
wake
up
in
the
morning
;
see
the
sky
;
walk
in
the
park
;
meet
Hugh
Whitbread
;
then
suddenly
in
came
Peter
;
then
these
roses
;
it
was
enough
.
After
that
,
how
unbelievable
death
was
!
--
that
it
must
end
;
and
no
one
in
the
whole
world
would
know
how
she
had
loved
it
all
;
how
,
every
instant
.
.
.
The
door
opened
.
Elizabeth
knew
that
her
mother
was
resting
.
She
came
in
very
quietly
.
She
stood
perfectly
still
.
Was
it
that
some
Mongol
had
been
wrecked
on
the
coast
of
Norfolk
(
as
Mrs.
Hilbery
said
)
,
had
mixed
with
the
Dalloway
ladies
,
perhaps
,
a
hundred
years
ago
?
For
the
Dalloways
,
in
general
,
were
fair-haired
;
blue-eyed
;
Elizabeth
,
on
the
contrary
,
was
dark
;
had
Chinese
eyes
in
a
pale
face
;
an
Oriental
mystery
;
was
gentle
,
considerate
,
still
.
As
a
child
,
she
had
had
a
perfect
sense
of
humour
;
but
now
at
seventeen
,
why
,
Clarissa
could
not
in
the
least
understand
,
she
had
become
very
serious
;
like
a
hyacinth
,
sheathed
in
glossy
green
,
with
buds
just
tinted
,
a
hyacinth
which
has
had
no
sun
.
She
stood
quite
still
and
looked
at
her
mother
;
but
the
door
was
ajar
,
and
outside
the
door
was
Miss
Kilman
,
as
Clarissa
knew
;
Miss
Kilman
in
her
mackintosh
,
listening
to
whatever
they
said
.
Yes
,
Miss
Kilman
stood
on
the
landing
,
and
wore
a
mackintosh
;
but
had
her
reasons
.
First
,
it
was
cheap
;
second
,
she
was
over
forty
;
and
did
not
,
after
all
,
dress
to
please
.
She
was
poor
,
moreover
;
degradingly
poor
.
Otherwise
she
would
not
be
taking
jobs
from
people
like
the
Dalloways
;
from
rich
people
,
who
liked
to
be
kind
.
Mr.
Dalloway
,
to
do
him
justice
,
had
been
kind
.
But
Mrs.
Dalloway
had
not
.
She
had
been
merely
condescending
.
She
came
from
the
most
worthless
of
all
classes
--
the
rich
,
with
a
smattering
of
culture
.
They
had
expensive
things
everywhere
;
pictures
,
carpets
,
lots
of
servants
.
She
considered
that
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
anything
that
the
Dalloways
did
for
her
.
She
had
been
cheated
.
Yes
,
the
word
was
no
exaggeration
,
for
surely
a
girl
has
a
right
to
some
kind
of
happiness
?
And
she
had
never
been
happy
,
what
with
being
so
clumsy
and
so
poor
.
And
then
,
just
as
she
might
have
had
a
chance
at
Miss
Dolby
's
school
,
the
war
came
;
and
she
had
never
been
able
to
tell
lies
.
Miss
Dolby
thought
she
would
be
happier
with
people
who
shared
her
views
about
the
Germans
.
She
had
had
to
go
.
It
was
true
that
the
family
was
of
German
origin
;
spelt
the
name
Kiehlman
in
the
eighteenth
century
;
but
her
brother
had
been
killed
.
They
turned
her
out
because
she
would
not
pretend
that
the
Germans
were
all
villains
--
when
she
had
German
friends
,
when
the
only
happy
days
of
her
life
had
been
spent
in
Germany
!
And
after
all
,
she
could
read
history
.
She
had
had
to
take
whatever
she
could
get
.
Mr.
Dalloway
had
come
across
her
working
for
the
Friends
.
He
had
allowed
her
(
and
that
was
really
generous
of
him
)
to
teach
his
daughter
history
.
Also
she
did
a
little
Extension
lecturing
and
so
on
.
Then
Our
Lord
had
come
to
her
(
and
here
she
always
bowed
her
head
)
.
She
had
seen
the
light
two
years
and
three
months
ago
.
Now
she
did
not
envy
women
like
Clarissa
Dalloway
;
she
pitied
them
.
She
pitied
and
despised
them
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
,
as
she
stood
on
the
soft
carpet
,
looking
at
the
old
engraving
of
a
little
girl
with
a
muff
.
With
all
this
luxury
going
on
,
what
hope
was
there
for
a
better
state
of
things
?
Instead
of
lying
on
a
sofa
--
''
My
mother
is
resting
,
''
Elizabeth
had
said
--
she
should
have
been
in
a
factory
;
behind
a
counter
;
Mrs.
Dalloway
and
all
the
other
fine
ladies
!
Bitter
and
burning
,
Miss
Kilman
had
turned
into
a
church
two
years
three
months
ago
.
She
had
heard
the
Rev
.
Edward
Whittaker
preach
;
the
boys
sing
;
had
seen
the
solemn
lights
descend
,
and
whether
it
was
the
music
,
or
the
voices
(
she
herself
when
alone
in
the
evening
found
comfort
in
a
violin
;
but
the
sound
was
excruciating
;
she
had
no
ear
)
,
the
hot
and
turbulent
feelings
which
boiled
and
surged
in
her
had
been
assuaged
as
she
sat
there
,
and
she
had
wept
copiously
,
and
gone
to
call
on
Mr.
Whittaker
at
his
private
house
in
Kensington
.
It
was
the
hand
of
God
,
he
said
.
The
Lord
had
shown
her
the
way
.
So
now
,
whenever
the
hot
and
painful
feelings
boiled
within
her
,
this
hatred
of
Mrs.
Dalloway
,
this
grudge
against
the
world
,
she
thought
of
God
.
She
thought
of
Mr.
Whittaker
.
Rage
was
succeeded
by
calm
.
A
sweet
savour
filled
her
veins
,
her
lips
parted
,
and
,
standing
formidable
upon
the
landing
in
her
mackintosh
,
she
looked
with
steady
and
sinister
serenity
at
Mrs.
Dalloway
,
who
came
out
with
her
daughter
.
Elizabeth
said
she
had
forgotten
her
gloves
.
That
was
because
Miss
Kilman
and
her
mother
hated
each
other
.
She
could
not
bear
to
see
them
together
.
She
ran
upstairs
to
find
her
gloves
.
But
Miss
Kilman
did
not
hate
Mrs.
Dalloway
.
Turning
her
large
gooseberry-coloured
eyes
upon
Clarissa
,
observing
her
small
pink
face
,
her
delicate
body
,
her
air
of
freshness
and
fashion
,
Miss
Kilman
felt
,
Fool
!
Simpleton
!
You
who
have
known
neither
sorrow
nor
pleasure
;
who
have
trifled
your
life
away
!
And
there
rose
in
her
an
overmastering
desire
to
overcome
her
;
to
unmask
her
.
If
she
could
have
felled
her
it
would
have
eased
her
.
But
it
was
not
the
body
;
it
was
the
soul
and
its
mockery
that
she
wished
to
subdue
;
make
feel
her
mastery
.
If
only
she
could
make
her
weep
;
could
ruin
her
;
humiliate
her
;
bring
her
to
her
knees
crying
,
You
are
right
!
But
this
was
God
's
will
,
not
Miss
Kilman
's
.
It
was
to
be
a
religious
victory
.
So
she
glared
;
so
she
glowered
.
Clarissa
was
really
shocked
.
This
a
Christian
--
this
woman
!
This
woman
had
taken
her
daughter
from
her
!
She
in
touch
with
invisible
presences
!
Heavy
,
ugly
,
commonplace
,
without
kindness
or
grace
,
she
know
the
meaning
of
life
!
``
You
are
taking
Elizabeth
to
the
Stores
?
''
Mrs.
Dalloway
said
.
Miss
Kilman
said
she
was
.
They
stood
there
.
Miss
Kilman
was
not
going
to
make
herself
agreeable
.
She
had
always
earned
her
living
.
Her
knowledge
of
modern
history
was
thorough
in
the
extreme
.
She
did
out
of
her
meagre
income
set
aside
so
much
for
causes
she
believed
in
;
whereas
this
woman
did
nothing
,
believed
nothing
;
brought
up
her
daughter
--
but
here
was
Elizabeth
,
rather
out
of
breath
,
the
beautiful
girl
.
So
they
were
going
to
the
Stores
.
Odd
it
was
,
as
Miss
Kilman
stood
there
(
and
stand
she
did
,
with
the
power
and
taciturnity
of
some
prehistoric
monster
armoured
for
primeval
warfare
)
,
how
,
second
by
second
,
the
idea
of
her
diminished
,
how
hatred
(
which
was
for
ideas
,
not
people
)
crumbled
,
how
she
lost
her
malignity
,
her
size
,
became
second
by
second
merely
Miss
Kilman
,
in
a
mackintosh
,
whom
Heaven
knows
Clarissa
would
have
liked
to
help
.
At
this
dwindling
of
the
monster
,
Clarissa
laughed
.
Saying
good-bye
,
she
laughed
.
Off
they
went
together
,
Miss
Kilman
and
Elizabeth
,
downstairs
.
With
a
sudden
impulse
,
with
a
violent
anguish
,
for
this
woman
was
taking
her
daughter
from
her
,
Clarissa
leant
over
the
bannisters
and
cried
out
,
``
Remember
the
party
!
Remember
our
party
tonight
!
''
But
Elizabeth
had
already
opened
the
front
door
;
there
was
a
van
passing
;
she
did
not
answer
.
Love
and
religion
!
thought
Clarissa
,
going
back
into
the
drawing-room
,
tingling
all
over
.
How
detestable
,
how
detestable
they
are
!
For
now
that
the
body
of
Miss
Kilman
was
not
before
her
,
it
overwhelmed
her
--
the
idea
.
The
cruelest
things
in
the
world
,
she
thought
,
seeing
them
clumsy
,
hot
,
domineering
,
hypocritical
,
eavesdropping
,
jealous
,
infinitely
cruel
and
unscrupulous
,
dressed
in
a
mackintosh
coat
,
on
the
landing
;
love
and
religion
.
Had
she
ever
tried
to
convert
any
one
herself
?
Did
she
not
wish
everybody
merely
to
be
themselves
?
And
she
watched
out
of
the
window
the
old
lady
opposite
climbing
upstairs
.
Let
her
climb
upstairs
if
she
wanted
to
;
let
her
stop
;
then
let
her
,
as
Clarissa
had
often
seen
her
,
gain
her
bedroom
,
part
her
curtains
,
and
disappear
again
into
the
background
.
Somehow
one
respected
that
--
that
old
woman
looking
out
of
the
window
,
quite
unconscious
that
she
was
being
watched
.
There
was
something
solemn
in
it
--
but
love
and
religion
would
destroy
that
,
whatever
it
was
,
the
privacy
of
the
soul
.
The
odious
Kilman
would
destroy
it
.
Yet
it
was
a
sight
that
made
her
want
to
cry
.
Love
destroyed
too
.
Everything
that
was
fine
,
everything
that
was
true
went
.
Take
Peter
Walsh
now
.
There
was
a
man
,
charming
,
clever
,
with
ideas
about
everything
.
If
you
wanted
to
know
about
Pope
,
say
,
or
Addison
,
or
just
to
talk
nonsense
,
what
people
were
like
,
what
things
meant
,
Peter
knew
better
than
any
one
.
It
was
Peter
who
had
helped
her
;
Peter
who
had
lent
her
books
.
But
look
at
the
women
he
loved
--
vulgar
,
trivial
,
commonplace
.
Think
of
Peter
in
love
--
he
came
to
see
her
after
all
these
years
,
and
what
did
he
talk
about
?
Himself
.
Horrible
passion
!
she
thought
.
Degrading
passion
!
she
thought
,
thinking
of
Kilman
and
her
Elizabeth
walking
to
the
Army
and
Navy
Stores
.
Big
Ben
struck
the
half-hour
.
How
extraordinary
it
was
,
strange
,
yes
,
touching
,
to
see
the
old
lady
(
they
had
been
neighbours
ever
so
many
years
)
move
away
from
the
window
,
as
if
she
were
attached
to
that
sound
,
that
string
.
Gigantic
as
it
was
,
it
had
something
to
do
with
her
.
Down
,
down
,
into
the
midst
of
ordinary
things
the
finger
fell
making
the
moment
solemn
.
She
was
forced
,
so
Clarissa
imagined
,
by
that
sound
,
to
move
,
to
go
--
but
where
?
Clarissa
tried
to
follow
her
as
she
turned
and
disappeared
,
and
could
still
just
see
her
white
cap
moving
at
the
back
of
the
bedroom
.
She
was
still
there
moving
about
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
Why
creeds
and
prayers
and
mackintoshes
?
when
,
thought
Clarissa
,
that
's
the
miracle
,
that
's
the
mystery
;
that
old
lady
,
she
meant
,
whom
she
could
see
going
from
chest
of
drawers
to
dressing-table
.
She
could
still
see
her
.
And
the
supreme
mystery
which
Kilman
might
say
she
had
solved
,
or
Peter
might
say
he
had
solved
,
but
Clarissa
did
n't
believe
either
of
them
had
the
ghost
of
an
idea
of
solving
,
was
simply
this
:
here
was
one
room
;
there
another
.
Did
religion
solve
that
,
or
love
?
Love
--
but
here
the
other
clock
,
the
clock
which
always
struck
two
minutes
after
Big
Ben
,
came
shuffling
in
with
its
lap
full
of
odds
and
ends
,
which
it
dumped
down
as
if
Big
Ben
were
all
very
well
with
his
majesty
laying
down
the
law
,
so
solemn
,
so
just
,
but
she
must
remember
all
sorts
of
little
things
besides
--
Mrs.
Marsham
,
Ellie
Henderson
,
glasses
for
ices
--
all
sorts
of
little
things
came
flooding
and
lapping
and
dancing
in
on
the
wake
of
that
solemn
stroke
which
lay
flat
like
a
bar
of
gold
on
the
sea
.
Mrs.
Marsham
,
Ellie
Henderson
,
glasses
for
ices
.
She
must
telephone
now
at
once
.
Volubly
,
troublously
,
the
late
clock
sounded
,
coming
in
on
the
wake
of
Big
Ben
,
with
its
lap
full
of
trifles
.
Beaten
up
,
broken
up
by
the
assault
of
carriages
,
the
brutality
of
vans
,
the
eager
advance
of
myriads
of
angular
men
,
of
flaunting
women
,
the
domes
and
spires
of
offices
and
hospitals
,
the
last
relics
of
this
lap
full
of
odds
and
ends
seemed
to
break
,
like
the
spray
of
an
exhausted
wave
,
upon
the
body
of
Miss
Kilman
standing
still
in
the
street
for
a
moment
to
mutter
``
It
is
the
flesh
.
''
It
was
the
flesh
that
she
must
control
.
Clarissa
Dalloway
had
insulted
her
.
That
she
expected
.
But
she
had
not
triumphed
;
she
had
not
mastered
the
flesh
.
Ugly
,
clumsy
,
Clarissa
Dalloway
had
laughed
at
her
for
being
that
;
and
had
revived
the
fleshly
desires
,
for
she
minded
looking
as
she
did
beside
Clarissa
.
Nor
could
she
talk
as
she
did
.
But
why
wish
to
resemble
her
?
Why
?
She
despised
Mrs.
Dalloway
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
.
She
was
not
serious
.
She
was
not
good
.
Her
life
was
a
tissue
of
vanity
and
deceit
.
Yet
Doris
Kilman
had
been
overcome
.
She
had
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
very
nearly
burst
into
tears
when
Clarissa
Dalloway
laughed
at
her
.
``
It
is
the
flesh
,
it
is
the
flesh
,
''
she
muttered
(
it
being
her
habit
to
talk
aloud
)
trying
to
subdue
this
turbulent
and
painful
feeling
as
she
walked
down
Victoria
Street
.
She
prayed
to
God
.
She
could
not
help
being
ugly
;
she
could
not
afford
to
buy
pretty
clothes
.
Clarissa
Dalloway
had
laughed
--
but
she
would
concentrate
her
mind
upon
something
else
until
she
had
reached
the
pillar-box
.
At
any
rate
she
had
got
Elizabeth
.
But
she
would
think
of
something
else
;
she
would
think
of
Russia
;
until
she
reached
the
pillar-box
.
How
nice
it
must
be
,
she
said
,
in
the
country
,
struggling
,
as
Mr.
Whittaker
had
told
her
,
with
that
violent
grudge
against
the
world
which
had
scorned
her
,
sneered
at
her
,
cast
her
off
,
beginning
with
this
indignity
--
the
infliction
of
her
unlovable
body
which
people
could
not
bear
to
see
.
Do
her
hair
as
she
might
,
her
forehead
remained
like
an
egg
,
bald
,
white
.
No
clothes
suited
her
.
She
might
buy
anything
.
And
for
a
woman
,
of
course
,
that
meant
never
meeting
the
opposite
sex
.
Never
would
she
come
first
with
any
one
.
Sometimes
lately
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
,
except
for
Elizabeth
,
her
food
was
all
that
she
lived
for
;
her
comforts
;
her
dinner
,
her
tea
;
her
hot-water
bottle
at
night
.
But
one
must
fight
;
vanquish
;
have
faith
in
God
.
Mr.
Whittaker
had
said
she
was
there
for
a
purpose
.
But
no
one
knew
the
agony
!
He
said
,
pointing
to
the
crucifix
,
that
God
knew
.
But
why
should
she
have
to
suffer
when
other
women
,
like
Clarissa
Dalloway
,
escaped
?
Knowledge
comes
through
suffering
,
said
Mr.
Whittaker
.
She
had
passed
the
pillar-box
,
and
Elizabeth
had
turned
into
the
cool
brown
tobacco
department
of
the
Army
and
Navy
Stores
while
she
was
still
muttering
to
herself
what
Mr.
Whittaker
had
said
about
knowledge
coming
through
suffering
and
the
flesh
.
``
The
flesh
,
''
she
muttered
.
What
department
did
she
want
?
Elizabeth
interrupted
her
.
``
Petticoats
,
''
she
said
abruptly
,
and
stalked
straight
on
to
the
lift
.
Up
they
went
.
Elizabeth
guided
her
this
way
and
that
;
guided
her
in
her
abstraction
as
if
she
had
been
a
great
child
,
an
unwieldy
battleship
.
There
were
the
petticoats
,
brown
,
decorous
,
striped
,
frivolous
,
solid
,
flimsy
;
and
she
chose
,
in
her
abstraction
,
portentously
,
and
the
girl
serving
thought
her
mad
.
Elizabeth
rather
wondered
,
as
they
did
up
the
parcel
,
what
Miss
Kilman
was
thinking
.
They
must
have
their
tea
,
said
Miss
Kilman
,
rousing
,
collecting
herself
.
They
had
their
tea
.
Elizabeth
rather
wondered
whether
Miss
Kilman
could
be
hungry
.
It
was
her
way
of
eating
,
eating
with
intensity
,
then
looking
,
again
and
again
,
at
a
plate
of
sugared
cakes
on
the
table
next
them
;
then
,
when
a
lady
and
a
child
sat
down
and
the
child
took
the
cake
,
could
Miss
Kilman
really
mind
it
?
Yes
,
Miss
Kilman
did
mind
it
.
She
had
wanted
that
cake
--
the
pink
one
.
The
pleasure
of
eating
was
almost
the
only
pure
pleasure
left
her
,
and
then
to
be
baffled
even
in
that
!
When
people
are
happy
,
they
have
a
reserve
,
she
had
told
Elizabeth
,
upon
which
to
draw
,
whereas
she
was
like
a
wheel
without
a
tyre
(
she
was
fond
of
such
metaphors
)
,
jolted
by
every
pebble
,
so
she
would
say
staying
on
after
the
lesson
standing
by
the
fire-place
with
her
bag
of
books
,
her
``
satchel
,
''
she
called
it
,
on
a
Tuesday
morning
,
after
the
lesson
was
over
.
And
she
talked
too
about
the
war
.
After
all
,
there
were
people
who
did
not
think
the
English
invariably
right
.
There
were
books
.
There
were
meetings
.
There
were
other
points
of
view
.
Would
Elizabeth
like
to
come
with
her
to
listen
to
So-and-so
(
a
most
extraordinary
looking
old
man
)
?
Then
Miss
Kilman
took
her
to
some
church
in
Kensington
and
they
had
tea
with
a
clergyman
.
She
had
lent
her
books
.
Law
,
medicine
,
politics
,
all
professions
are
open
to
women
of
your
generation
,
said
Miss
Kilman
.
But
for
herself
,
her
career
was
absolutely
ruined
and
was
it
her
fault
?
Good
gracious
,
said
Elizabeth
,
no
.
And
her
mother
would
come
calling
to
say
that
a
hamper
had
come
from
Bourton
and
would
Miss
Kilman
like
some
flowers
?
To
Miss
Kilman
she
was
always
very
,
very
nice
,
but
Miss
Kilman
squashed
the
flowers
all
in
a
bunch
,
and
had
n't
any
small
talk
,
and
what
interested
Miss
Kilman
bored
her
mother
,
and
Miss
Kilman
and
she
were
terrible
together
;
and
Miss
Kilman
swelled
and
looked
very
plain
.
But
then
Miss
Kilman
was
frightfully
clever
.
Elizabeth
had
never
thought
about
the
poor
.
They
lived
with
everything
they
wanted
,
--
her
mother
had
breakfast
in
bed
every
day
;
Lucy
carried
it
up
;
and
she
liked
old
women
because
they
were
Duchesses
,
and
being
descended
from
some
Lord
.
But
Miss
Kilman
said
(
one
of
those
Tuesday
mornings
when
the
lesson
was
over
)
,
``
My
grandfather
kept
an
oil
and
colour
shop
in
Kensington
.
''
Miss
Kilman
made
one
feel
so
small
.
Miss
Kilman
took
another
cup
of
tea
.
Elizabeth
,
with
her
oriental
bearing
,
her
inscrutable
mystery
,
sat
perfectly
upright
;
no
,
she
did
not
want
anything
more
.
She
looked
for
her
gloves
--
her
white
gloves
.
They
were
under
the
table
.
Ah
,
but
she
must
not
go
!
Miss
Kilman
could
not
let
her
go
!
this
youth
,
that
was
so
beautiful
,
this
girl
,
whom
she
genuinely
loved
!
Her
large
hand
opened
and
shut
on
the
table
.
But
perhaps
it
was
a
little
flat
somehow
,
Elizabeth
felt
.
And
really
she
would
like
to
go
.
But
said
Miss
Kilman
,
``
I
've
not
quite
finished
yet
.
''
Of
course
,
then
,
Elizabeth
would
wait
.
But
it
was
rather
stuffy
in
here
.
``
Are
you
going
to
the
party
to-night
?
''
Miss
Kilman
said
.
Elizabeth
supposed
she
was
going
;
her
mother
wanted
her
to
go
.
She
must
not
let
parties
absorb
her
,
Miss
Kilman
said
,
fingering
the
last
two
inches
of
a
chocolate
éclair
.
She
did
not
much
like
parties
,
Elizabeth
said
.
Miss
Kilman
opened
her
mouth
,
slightly
projected
her
chin
,
and
swallowed
down
the
last
inches
of
the
chocolate
éclair
,
then
wiped
her
fingers
,
and
washed
the
tea
round
in
her
cup
.
She
was
about
to
split
asunder
,
she
felt
.
The
agony
was
so
terrific
.
If
she
could
grasp
her
,
if
she
could
clasp
her
,
if
she
could
make
her
hers
absolutely
and
forever
and
then
die
;
that
was
all
she
wanted
.
But
to
sit
here
,
unable
to
think
of
anything
to
say
;
to
see
Elizabeth
turning
against
her
;
to
be
felt
repulsive
even
by
her
--
it
was
too
much
;
she
could
not
stand
it
.
The
thick
fingers
curled
inwards
.
``
I
never
go
to
parties
,
''
said
Miss
Kilman
,
just
to
keep
Elizabeth
from
going
.
``
People
do
n't
ask
me
to
parties
''
--
and
she
knew
as
she
said
it
that
it
was
this
egotism
that
was
her
undoing
;
Mr.
Whittaker
had
warned
her
;
but
she
could
not
help
it
.
She
had
suffered
so
horribly
.
``
Why
should
they
ask
me
?
''
she
said
.
``
I
'm
plain
,
I
'm
unhappy
.
''
She
knew
it
was
idiotic
.
But
it
was
all
those
people
passing
--
people
with
parcels
who
despised
her
,
who
made
her
say
it
.
However
,
she
was
Doris
Kilman
.
She
had
her
degree
.
She
was
a
woman
who
had
made
her
way
in
the
world
.
Her
knowledge
of
modern
history
was
more
than
respectable
.
``
I
do
n't
pity
myself
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
pity
''
--
she
meant
to
say
``
your
mother
''
but
no
,
she
could
not
,
not
to
Elizabeth
.
``
I
pity
other
people
,
''
she
said
,
``
more
.
''
Like
some
dumb
creature
who
has
been
brought
up
to
a
gate
for
an
unknown
purpose
,
and
stands
there
longing
to
gallop
away
,
Elizabeth
Dalloway
sat
silent
.
Was
Miss
Kilman
going
to
say
anything
more
?
``
Do
n't
quite
forget
me
,
''
said
Doris
Kilman
;
her
voice
quivered
.
Right
away
to
the
end
of
the
field
the
dumb
creature
galloped
in
terror
.
The
great
hand
opened
and
shut
.
Elizabeth
turned
her
head
.
The
waitress
came
.
One
had
to
pay
at
the
desk
,
Elizabeth
said
,
and
went
off
,
drawing
out
,
so
Miss
Kilman
felt
,
the
very
entrails
in
her
body
,
stretching
them
as
she
crossed
the
room
,
and
then
,
with
a
final
twist
,
bowing
her
head
very
politely
,
she
went
.
She
had
gone
.
Miss
Kilman
sat
at
the
marble
table
among
the
éclairs
,
stricken
once
,
twice
,
thrice
by
shocks
of
suffering
.
She
had
gone
.
Mrs.
Dalloway
had
triumphed
.
Elizabeth
had
gone
.
Beauty
had
gone
,
youth
had
gone
.
So
she
sat
.
She
got
up
,
blundered
off
among
the
little
tables
,
rocking
slightly
from
side
to
side
,
and
somebody
came
after
her
with
her
petticoat
,
and
she
lost
her
way
,
and
was
hemmed
in
by
trunks
specially
prepared
for
taking
to
India
;
next
got
among
the
accouchement
sets
,
and
baby
linen
;
through
all
the
commodities
of
the
world
,
perishable
and
permanent
,
hams
,
drugs
,
flowers
,
stationery
,
variously
smelling
,
now
sweet
,
now
sour
she
lurched
;
saw
herself
thus
lurching
with
her
hat
askew
,
very
red
in
the
face
,
full
length
in
a
looking-glass
;
and
at
last
came
out
into
the
street
.
The
tower
of
Westminster
Cathedral
rose
in
front
of
her
,
the
habitation
of
God
.
In
the
midst
of
the
traffic
,
there
was
the
habitation
of
God
.
Doggedly
she
set
off
with
her
parcel
to
that
other
sanctuary
,
the
Abbey
,
where
,
raising
her
hands
in
a
tent
before
her
face
,
she
sat
beside
those
driven
into
shelter
too
;
the
variously
assorted
worshippers
,
now
divested
of
social
rank
,
almost
of
sex
,
as
they
raised
their
hands
before
their
faces
;
but
once
they
removed
them
,
instantly
reverent
,
middle
class
,
English
men
and
women
,
some
of
them
desirous
of
seeing
the
wax
works
.
But
Miss
Kilman
held
her
tent
before
her
face
.
Now
she
was
deserted
;
now
rejoined
.
New
worshippers
came
in
from
the
street
to
replace
the
strollers
,
and
still
,
as
people
gazed
round
and
shuffled
past
the
tomb
of
the
Unknown
Warrior
,
still
she
barred
her
eyes
with
her
fingers
and
tried
in
this
double
darkness
,
for
the
light
in
the
Abbey
was
bodiless
,
to
aspire
above
the
vanities
,
the
desires
,
the
commodities
,
to
rid
herself
both
of
hatred
and
of
love
.
Her
hands
twitched
.
She
seemed
to
struggle
.
Yet
to
others
God
was
accessible
and
the
path
to
Him
smooth
.
Mr.
Fletcher
,
retired
,
of
the
Treasury
,
Mrs.
Gorham
,
widow
of
the
famous
K.C.
,
approached
Him
simply
,
and
having
done
their
praying
,
leant
back
,
enjoyed
the
music
(
the
organ
pealed
sweetly
)
,
and
saw
Miss
Kilman
at
the
end
of
the
row
,
praying
,
praying
,
and
,
being
still
on
the
threshold
of
their
underworld
,
thought
of
her
sympathetically
as
a
soul
haunting
the
same
territory
;
a
soul
cut
out
of
immaterial
substance
;
not
a
woman
,
a
soul
.
But
Mr.
Fletcher
had
to
go
.
He
had
to
pass
her
,
and
being
himself
neat
as
a
new
pin
,
could
not
help
being
a
little
distressed
by
the
poor
lady
's
disorder
;
her
hair
down
;
her
parcel
on
the
floor
.
She
did
not
at
once
let
him
pass
.
But
,
as
he
stood
gazing
about
him
,
at
the
white
marbles
,
grey
window
panes
,
and
accumulated
treasures
(
for
he
was
extremely
proud
of
the
Abbey
)
,
her
largeness
,
robustness
,
and
power
as
she
sat
there
shifting
her
knees
from
time
to
time
(
it
was
so
rough
the
approach
to
her
God
--
so
tough
her
desires
)
impressed
him
,
as
they
had
impressed
Mrs.
Dalloway
(
she
could
not
get
the
thought
of
her
out
of
her
mind
that
afternoon
)
,
the
Rev
.
Edward
Whittaker
,
and
Elizabeth
too
.
And
Elizabeth
waited
in
Victoria
Street
for
an
omnibus
.
It
was
so
nice
to
be
out
of
doors
.
She
thought
perhaps
she
need
not
go
home
just
yet
.
It
was
so
nice
to
be
out
in
the
air
.
So
she
would
get
on
to
an
omnibus
.
And
already
,
even
as
she
stood
there
,
in
her
very
well
cut
clothes
,
it
was
beginning
.
.
.
.
People
were
beginning
to
compare
her
to
poplar
trees
,
early
dawn
,
hyacinths
,
fawns
,
running
water
,
and
garden
lilies
;
and
it
made
her
life
a
burden
to
her
,
for
she
so
much
preferred
being
left
alone
to
do
what
she
liked
in
the
country
,
but
they
would
compare
her
to
lilies
,
and
she
had
to
go
to
parties
,
and
London
was
so
dreary
compared
with
being
alone
in
the
country
with
her
father
and
the
dogs
.
Buses
swooped
,
settled
,
were
off
--
garish
caravans
,
glistening
with
red
and
yellow
varnish
.
But
which
should
she
get
on
to
?
She
had
no
preferences
.
Of
course
,
she
would
not
push
her
way
.
She
inclined
to
be
passive
.
It
was
expression
she
needed
,
but
her
eyes
were
fine
,
Chinese
,
oriental
,
and
,
as
her
mother
said
,
with
such
nice
shoulders
and
holding
herself
so
straight
,
she
was
always
charming
to
look
at
;
and
lately
,
in
the
evening
especially
,
when
she
was
interested
,
for
she
never
seemed
excited
,
she
looked
almost
beautiful
,
very
stately
,
very
serene
.
What
could
she
be
thinking
?
Every
man
fell
in
love
with
her
,
and
she
was
really
awfully
bored
.
For
it
was
beginning
.
Her
mother
could
see
that
--
the
compliments
were
beginning
.
That
she
did
not
care
more
about
it
--
for
instance
for
her
clothes
--
sometimes
worried
Clarissa
,
but
perhaps
it
was
as
well
with
all
those
puppies
and
guinea
pigs
about
having
distemper
,
and
it
gave
her
a
charm
.
And
now
there
was
this
odd
friendship
with
Miss
Kilman
.
Well
,
thought
Clarissa
about
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
reading
Baron
Marbot
for
she
could
not
sleep
,
it
proves
she
has
a
heart
.
Suddenly
Elizabeth
stepped
forward
and
most
competently
boarded
the
omnibus
,
in
front
of
everybody
.
She
took
a
seat
on
top
.
The
impetuous
creature
--
a
pirate
--
started
forward
,
sprang
away
;
she
had
to
hold
the
rail
to
steady
herself
,
for
a
pirate
it
was
,
reckless
,
unscrupulous
,
bearing
down
ruthlessly
,
circumventing
dangerously
,
boldly
snatching
a
passenger
,
or
ignoring
a
passenger
,
squeezing
eel-like
and
arrogant
in
between
,
and
then
rushing
insolently
all
sails
spread
up
Whitehall
.
And
did
Elizabeth
give
one
thought
to
poor
Miss
Kilman
who
loved
her
without
jealousy
,
to
whom
she
had
been
a
fawn
in
the
open
,
a
moon
in
a
glade
?
She
was
delighted
to
be
free
.
The
fresh
air
was
so
delicious
.
It
had
been
so
stuffy
in
the
Army
and
Navy
Stores
.
And
now
it
was
like
riding
,
to
be
rushing
up
Whitehall
;
and
to
each
movement
of
the
omnibus
the
beautiful
body
in
the
fawn-coloured
coat
responded
freely
like
a
rider
,
like
the
figure-head
of
a
ship
,
for
the
breeze
slightly
disarrayed
her
;
the
heat
gave
her
cheeks
the
pallor
of
white
painted
wood
;
and
her
fine
eyes
,
having
no
eyes
to
meet
,
gazed
ahead
,
blank
,
bright
,
with
the
staring
incredible
innocence
of
sculpture
.
It
was
always
talking
about
her
own
sufferings
that
made
Miss
Kilman
so
difficult
.
And
was
she
right
?
If
it
was
being
on
committees
and
giving
up
hours
and
hours
every
day
(
she
hardly
ever
saw
him
in
London
)
that
helped
the
poor
,
her
father
did
that
,
goodness
knows
,
--
if
that
was
what
Miss
Kilman
meant
about
being
a
Christian
;
but
it
was
so
difficult
to
say
.
Oh
,
she
would
like
to
go
a
little
further
.
Another
penny
was
it
to
the
Strand
?
Here
was
another
penny
then
.
She
would
go
up
the
Strand
.
She
liked
people
who
were
ill.
And
every
profession
is
open
to
the
women
of
your
generation
,
said
Miss
Kilman
.
So
she
might
be
a
doctor
.
She
might
be
a
farmer
.
Animals
are
often
ill.
She
might
own
a
thousand
acres
and
have
people
under
her
.
She
would
go
and
see
them
in
their
cottages
.
This
was
Somerset
House
.
One
might
be
a
very
good
farmer
--
and
that
,
strangely
enough
though
Miss
Kilman
had
her
share
in
it
,
was
almost
entirely
due
to
Somerset
House
.
It
looked
so
splendid
,
so
serious
,
that
great
grey
building
.
And
she
liked
the
feeling
of
people
working
.
She
liked
those
churches
,
like
shapes
of
grey
paper
,
breasting
the
stream
of
the
Strand
.
It
was
quite
different
here
from
Westminster
,
she
thought
,
getting
off
at
Chancery
Lane
.
It
was
so
serious
;
it
was
so
busy
.
In
short
,
she
would
like
to
have
a
profession
.
She
would
become
a
doctor
,
a
farmer
,
possibly
go
into
Parliament
,
if
she
found
it
necessary
,
all
because
of
the
Strand
.
The
feet
of
those
people
busy
about
their
activities
,
hands
putting
stone
to
stone
,
minds
eternally
occupied
not
with
trivial
chatterings
(
comparing
women
to
poplars
--
which
was
rather
exciting
,
of
course
,
but
very
silly
)
,
but
with
thoughts
of
ships
,
of
business
,
of
law
,
of
administration
,
and
with
it
all
so
stately
(
she
was
in
the
Temple
)
,
gay
(
there
was
the
river
)
,
pious
(
there
was
the
Church
)
,
made
her
quite
determined
,
whatever
her
mother
might
say
,
to
become
either
a
farmer
or
a
doctor
.
But
she
was
,
of
course
,
rather
lazy
.
And
it
was
much
better
to
say
nothing
about
it
.
It
seemed
so
silly
.
It
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
did
sometimes
happen
,
when
one
was
alone
--
buildings
without
architects
'
names
,
crowds
of
people
coming
back
from
the
city
having
more
power
than
single
clergymen
in
Kensington
,
than
any
of
the
books
Miss
Kilman
had
lent
her
,
to
stimulate
what
lay
slumbrous
,
clumsy
,
and
shy
on
the
mind
's
sandy
floor
to
break
surface
,
as
a
child
suddenly
stretches
its
arms
;
it
was
just
that
,
perhaps
,
a
sigh
,
a
stretch
of
the
arms
,
an
impulse
,
a
revelation
,
which
has
its
effects
for
ever
,
and
then
down
again
it
went
to
the
sandy
floor
.
She
must
go
home
.
She
must
dress
for
dinner
.
But
what
was
the
time
?
--
where
was
a
clock
?
She
looked
up
Fleet
Street
.
She
walked
just
a
little
way
towards
St.
Paul
's
,
shyly
,
like
some
one
penetrating
on
tiptoe
,
exploring
a
strange
house
by
night
with
a
candle
,
on
edge
lest
the
owner
should
suddenly
fling
wide
his
bedroom
door
and
ask
her
business
,
nor
did
she
dare
wander
off
into
queer
alleys
,
tempting
bye-streets
,
any
more
than
in
a
strange
house
open
doors
which
might
be
bedroom
doors
,
or
sitting-room
doors
,
or
lead
straight
to
the
larder
.
For
no
Dalloways
came
down
the
Strand
daily
;
she
was
a
pioneer
,
a
stray
,
venturing
,
trusting
.
In
many
ways
,
her
mother
felt
,
she
was
extremely
immature
,
like
a
child
still
,
attached
to
dolls
,
to
old
slippers
;
a
perfect
baby
;
and
that
was
charming
.
But
then
,
of
course
,
there
was
in
the
Dalloway
family
the
tradition
of
public
service
.
Abbesses
,
principals
,
head
mistresses
,
dignitaries
,
in
the
republic
of
women
--
without
being
brilliant
,
any
of
them
,
they
were
that
.
She
penetrated
a
little
further
in
the
direction
of
St.
Paul
's
.
She
liked
the
geniality
,
sisterhood
,
motherhood
,
brotherhood
of
this
uproar
.
It
seemed
to
her
good
.
The
noise
was
tremendous
;
and
suddenly
there
were
trumpets
(
the
unemployed
)
blaring
,
rattling
about
in
the
uproar
;
military
music
;
as
if
people
were
marching
;
yet
had
they
been
dying
--
had
some
woman
breathed
her
last
and
whoever
was
watching
,
opening
the
window
of
the
room
where
she
had
just
brought
off
that
act
of
supreme
dignity
,
looked
down
on
Fleet
Street
,
that
uproar
,
that
military
music
would
have
come
triumphing
up
to
him
,
consolatory
,
indifferent
.
It
was
not
conscious
.
There
was
no
recognition
in
it
of
one
fortune
,
or
fate
,
and
for
that
very
reason
even
to
those
dazed
with
watching
for
the
last
shivers
of
consciousness
on
the
faces
of
the
dying
,
consoling
.
Forgetfulness
in
people
might
wound
,
their
ingratitude
corrode
,
but
this
voice
,
pouring
endlessly
,
year
in
year
out
,
would
take
whatever
it
might
be
;
this
vow
;
this
van
;
this
life
;
this
procession
,
would
wrap
them
all
about
and
carry
them
on
,
as
in
the
rough
stream
of
a
glacier
the
ice
holds
a
splinter
of
bone
,
a
blue
petal
,
some
oak
trees
,
and
rolls
them
on
.
But
it
was
later
than
she
thought
.
Her
mother
would
not
like
her
to
be
wandering
off
alone
like
this
.
She
turned
back
down
the
Strand
.
A
puff
of
wind
(
in
spite
of
the
heat
,
there
was
quite
a
wind
)
blew
a
thin
black
veil
over
the
sun
and
over
the
Strand
.
The
faces
faded
;
the
omnibuses
suddenly
lost
their
glow
.
For
although
the
clouds
were
of
mountainous
white
so
that
one
could
fancy
hacking
hard
chips
off
with
a
hatchet
,
with
broad
golden
slopes
,
lawns
of
celestial
pleasure
gardens
,
on
their
flanks
,
and
had
all
the
appearance
of
settled
habitations
assembled
for
the
conference
of
gods
above
the
world
,
there
was
a
perpetual
movement
among
them
.
Signs
were
interchanged
,
when
,
as
if
to
fulfil
some
scheme
arranged
already
,
now
a
summit
dwindled
,
now
a
whole
block
of
pyramidal
size
which
had
kept
its
station
inalterably
advanced
into
the
midst
or
gravely
led
the
procession
to
fresh
anchorage
.
Fixed
though
they
seemed
at
their
posts
,
at
rest
in
perfect
unanimity
,
nothing
could
be
fresher
,
freer
,
more
sensitive
superficially
than
the
snow-white
or
gold-kindled
surface
;
to
change
,
to
go
,
to
dismantle
the
solemn
assemblage
was
immediately
possible
;
and
in
spite
of
the
grave
fixity
,
the
accumulated
robustness
and
solidity
,
now
they
struck
light
to
the
earth
,
now
darkness
.
Calmly
and
competently
,
Elizabeth
Dalloway
mounted
the
Westminster
omnibus
.
Going
and
coming
,
beckoning
,
signalling
,
so
the
light
and
shadow
which
now
made
the
wall
grey
,
now
the
bananas
bright
yellow
,
now
made
the
Strand
grey
,
now
made
the
omnibuses
bright
yellow
,
seemed
to
Septimus
Warren
Smith
lying
on
the
sofa
in
the
sitting-room
;
watching
the
watery
gold
glow
and
fade
with
the
astonishing
sensibility
of
some
live
creature
on
the
roses
,
on
the
wall-paper
.
Outside
the
trees
dragged
their
leaves
like
nets
through
the
depths
of
the
air
;
the
sound
of
water
was
in
the
room
and
through
the
waves
came
the
voices
of
birds
singing
.
Every
power
poured
its
treasures
on
his
head
,
and
his
hand
lay
there
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
,
as
he
had
seen
his
hand
lie
when
he
was
bathing
,
floating
,
on
the
top
of
the
waves
,
while
far
away
on
shore
he
heard
dogs
barking
and
barking
far
away
.
Fear
no
more
,
says
the
heart
in
the
body
;
fear
no
more
.
He
was
not
afraid
.
At
every
moment
Nature
signified
by
some
laughing
hint
like
that
gold
spot
which
went
round
the
wall
--
there
,
there
,
there
--
her
determination
to
show
,
by
brandishing
her
plumes
,
shaking
her
tresses
,
flinging
her
mantle
this
way
and
that
,
beautifully
,
always
beautifully
,
and
standing
close
up
to
breathe
through
her
hollowed
hands
Shakespeare
's
words
,
her
meaning
.
Rezia
,
sitting
at
the
table
twisting
a
hat
in
her
hands
,
watched
him
;
saw
him
smiling
.
He
was
happy
then
.
But
she
could
not
bear
to
see
him
smiling
.
It
was
not
marriage
;
it
was
not
being
one
's
husband
to
look
strange
like
that
,
always
to
be
starting
,
laughing
,
sitting
hour
after
hour
silent
,
or
clutching
her
and
telling
her
to
write
.
The
table
drawer
was
full
of
those
writings
;
about
war
;
about
Shakespeare
;
about
great
discoveries
;
how
there
is
no
death
.
Lately
he
had
become
excited
suddenly
for
no
reason
(
and
both
Dr.
Holmes
and
Sir
William
Bradshaw
said
excitement
was
the
worst
thing
for
him
)
,
and
waved
his
hands
and
cried
out
that
he
knew
the
truth
!
He
knew
everything
!
That
man
,
his
friend
who
was
killed
,
Evans
,
had
come
,
he
said
.
He
was
singing
behind
the
screen
.
She
wrote
it
down
just
as
he
spoke
it
.
Some
things
were
very
beautiful
;
others
sheer
nonsense
.
And
he
was
always
stopping
in
the
middle
,
changing
his
mind
;
wanting
to
add
something
;
hearing
something
new
;
listening
with
his
hand
up
.
But
she
heard
nothing
.
And
once
they
found
the
girl
who
did
the
room
reading
one
of
these
papers
in
fits
of
laughter
.
It
was
a
dreadful
pity
.
For
that
made
Septimus
cry
out
about
human
cruelty
--
how
they
tear
each
other
to
pieces
.
The
fallen
,
he
said
,
they
tear
to
pieces
.
``
Holmes
is
on
us
,
''
he
would
say
,
and
he
would
invent
stories
about
Holmes
;
Holmes
eating
porridge
;
Holmes
reading
Shakespeare
--
making
himself
roar
with
laughter
or
rage
,
for
Dr.
Holmes
seemed
to
stand
for
something
horrible
to
him
.
``
Human
nature
,
''
he
called
him
.
Then
there
were
the
visions
.
He
was
drowned
,
he
used
to
say
,
and
lying
on
a
cliff
with
the
gulls
screaming
over
him
.
He
would
look
over
the
edge
of
the
sofa
down
into
the
sea
.
Or
he
was
hearing
music
.
Really
it
was
only
a
barrel
organ
or
some
man
crying
in
the
street
.
But
``
Lovely
!
''
he
used
to
cry
,
and
the
tears
would
run
down
his
cheeks
,
which
was
to
her
the
most
dreadful
thing
of
all
,
to
see
a
man
like
Septimus
,
who
had
fought
,
who
was
brave
,
crying
.
And
he
would
lie
listening
until
suddenly
he
would
cry
that
he
was
falling
down
,
down
into
the
flames
!
Actually
she
would
look
for
flames
,
it
was
so
vivid
.
But
there
was
nothing
.
They
were
alone
in
the
room
.
It
was
a
dream
,
she
would
tell
him
and
so
quiet
him
at
last
,
but
sometimes
she
was
frightened
too
.
She
sighed
as
she
sat
sewing
.
Her
sigh
was
tender
and
enchanting
,
like
the
wind
outside
a
wood
in
the
evening
.
Now
she
put
down
her
scissors
;
now
she
turned
to
take
something
from
the
table
.
A
little
stir
,
a
little
crinkling
,
a
little
tapping
built
up
something
on
the
table
there
,
where
she
sat
sewing
.
Through
his
eyelashes
he
could
see
her
blurred
outline
;
her
little
black
body
;
her
face
and
hands
;
her
turning
movements
at
the
table
,
as
she
took
up
a
reel
,
or
looked
(
she
was
apt
to
lose
things
)
for
her
silk
.
She
was
making
a
hat
for
Mrs.
Filmer
's
married
daughter
,
whose
name
was
--
he
had
forgotten
her
name
.
``
What
is
the
name
of
Mrs.
Filmer
's
married
daughter
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Mrs.
Peters
,
''
said
Rezia
.
She
was
afraid
it
was
too
small
,
she
said
,
holding
it
before
her
.
Mrs.
Peters
was
a
big
woman
;
but
she
did
not
like
her
.
It
was
only
because
Mrs.
Filmer
had
been
so
good
to
them
.
``
She
gave
me
grapes
this
morning
,
''
she
said
--
that
Rezia
wanted
to
do
something
to
show
that
they
were
grateful
.
She
had
come
into
the
room
the
other
evening
and
found
Mrs.
Peters
,
who
thought
they
were
out
,
playing
the
gramophone
.
``
Was
it
true
?
''
he
asked
.
She
was
playing
the
gramophone
?
Yes
;
she
had
told
him
about
it
at
the
time
;
she
had
found
Mrs.
Peters
playing
the
gramophone
.
He
began
,
very
cautiously
,
to
open
his
eyes
,
to
see
whether
a
gramophone
was
really
there
.
But
real
things
--
real
things
were
too
exciting
.
He
must
be
cautious
.
He
would
not
go
mad
.
First
he
looked
at
the
fashion
papers
on
the
lower
shelf
,
then
,
gradually
at
the
gramophone
with
the
green
trumpet
.
Nothing
could
be
more
exact
.
And
so
,
gathering
courage
,
he
looked
at
the
sideboard
;
the
plate
of
bananas
;
the
engraving
of
Queen
Victoria
and
the
Prince
Consort
;
at
the
mantelpiece
,
with
the
jar
of
roses
.
None
of
these
things
moved
.
All
were
still
;
all
were
real
.
``
She
is
a
woman
with
a
spiteful
tongue
,
''
said
Rezia
.
``
What
does
Mr.
Peters
do
?
''
Septimus
asked
.
``
Ah
,
''
said
Rezia
,
trying
to
remember
.
She
thought
Mrs.
Filmer
had
said
that
he
travelled
for
some
company
.
``
Just
now
he
is
in
Hull
,
''
she
said
.
``
Just
now
!
''
She
said
that
with
her
Italian
accent
.
She
said
that
herself
.
He
shaded
his
eyes
so
that
he
might
see
only
a
little
of
her
face
at
a
time
,
first
the
chin
,
then
the
nose
,
then
the
forehead
,
in
case
it
were
deformed
,
or
had
some
terrible
mark
on
it
.
But
no
,
there
she
was
,
perfectly
natural
,
sewing
,
with
the
pursed
lips
that
women
have
,
the
set
,
the
melancholy
expression
,
when
sewing
.
But
there
was
nothing
terrible
about
it
,
he
assured
himself
,
looking
a
second
time
,
a
third
time
at
her
face
,
her
hands
,
for
what
was
frightening
or
disgusting
in
her
as
she
sat
there
in
broad
daylight
,
sewing
?
Mrs.
Peters
had
a
spiteful
tongue
.
Mr.
Peters
was
in
Hull
.
Why
then
rage
and
prophesy
?
Why
fly
scourged
and
outcast
?
Why
be
made
to
tremble
and
sob
by
the
clouds
?
Why
seek
truths
and
deliver
messages
when
Rezia
sat
sticking
pins
into
the
front
of
her
dress
,
and
Mr.
Peters
was
in
Hull
?
Miracles
,
revelations
,
agonies
,
loneliness
,
falling
through
the
sea
,
down
,
down
into
the
flames
,
all
were
burnt
out
,
for
he
had
a
sense
,
as
he
watched
Rezia
trimming
the
straw
hat
for
Mrs.
Peters
,
of
a
coverlet
of
flowers
.
``
It
's
too
small
for
Mrs.
Peters
,
''
said
Septimus
.
For
the
first
time
for
days
he
was
speaking
as
he
used
to
do
!
Of
course
it
was
--
absurdly
small
,
she
said
.
But
Mrs.
Peters
had
chosen
it
.
He
took
it
out
of
her
hands
.
He
said
it
was
an
organ
grinder
's
monkey
's
hat
.
How
it
rejoiced
her
that
!
Not
for
weeks
had
they
laughed
like
this
together
,
poking
fun
privately
like
married
people
.
What
she
meant
was
that
if
Mrs.
Filmer
had
come
in
,
or
Mrs.
Peters
or
anybody
they
would
not
have
understood
what
she
and
Septimus
were
laughing
at
.
``
There
,
''
she
said
,
pinning
a
rose
to
one
side
of
the
hat
.
Never
had
she
felt
so
happy
!
Never
in
her
life
!
But
that
was
still
more
ridiculous
,
Septimus
said
.
Now
the
poor
woman
looked
like
a
pig
at
a
fair
.
(
Nobody
ever
made
her
laugh
as
Septimus
did
.
)
What
had
she
got
in
her
work-box
?
She
had
ribbons
and
beads
,
tassels
,
artificial
flowers
.
She
tumbled
them
out
on
the
table
.
He
began
putting
odd
colours
together
--
for
though
he
had
no
fingers
,
could
not
even
do
up
a
parcel
,
he
had
a
wonderful
eye
,
and
often
he
was
right
,
sometimes
absurd
,
of
course
,
but
sometimes
wonderfully
right
.
``
She
shall
have
a
beautiful
hat
!
''
he
murmured
,
taking
up
this
and
that
,
Rezia
kneeling
by
his
side
,
looking
over
his
shoulder
.
Now
it
was
finished
--
that
is
to
say
the
design
;
she
must
stitch
it
together
.
But
she
must
be
very
,
very
careful
,
he
said
,
to
keep
it
just
as
he
had
made
it
.
So
she
sewed
.
When
she
sewed
,
he
thought
,
she
made
a
sound
like
a
kettle
on
the
hob
;
bubbling
,
murmuring
,
always
busy
,
her
strong
little
pointed
fingers
pinching
and
poking
;
her
needle
flashing
straight
.
The
sun
might
go
in
and
out
,
on
the
tassels
,
on
the
wall-paper
,
but
he
would
wait
,
he
thought
,
stretching
out
his
feet
,
looking
at
his
ringed
sock
at
the
end
of
the
sofa
;
he
would
wait
in
this
warm
place
,
this
pocket
of
still
air
,
which
one
comes
on
at
the
edge
of
a
wood
sometimes
in
the
evening
,
when
,
because
of
a
fall
in
the
ground
,
or
some
arrangement
of
the
trees
(
one
must
be
scientific
above
all
,
scientific
)
,
warmth
lingers
,
and
the
air
buffets
the
cheek
like
the
wing
of
a
bird
.
``
There
it
is
,
''
said
Rezia
,
twirling
Mrs.
Peters
'
hat
on
the
tips
of
her
fingers
.
``
That
'll
do
for
the
moment
.
Later
.
.
.
''
her
sentence
bubbled
away
drip
,
drip
,
drip
,
like
a
contented
tap
left
running
.
It
was
wonderful
.
Never
had
he
done
anything
which
made
him
feel
so
proud
.
It
was
so
real
,
it
was
so
substantial
,
Mrs.
Peters
'
hat
.
``
Just
look
at
it
,
''
he
said
.
Yes
,
it
would
always
make
her
happy
to
see
that
hat
.
He
had
become
himself
then
,
he
had
laughed
then
.
They
had
been
alone
together
.
Always
she
would
like
that
hat
.
He
told
her
to
try
it
on
.
``
But
I
must
look
so
queer
!
''
she
cried
,
running
over
to
the
glass
and
looking
first
this
side
then
that
.
Then
she
snatched
it
off
again
,
for
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
.
Could
it
be
Sir
William
Bradshaw
?
Had
he
sent
already
?
No
!
it
was
only
the
small
girl
with
the
evening
paper
.
What
always
happened
,
then
happened
--
what
happened
every
night
of
their
lives
.
The
small
girl
sucked
her
thumb
at
the
door
;
Rezia
went
down
on
her
knees
;
Rezia
cooed
and
kissed
;
Rezia
got
a
bag
of
sweets
out
of
the
table
drawer
.
For
so
it
always
happened
.
First
one
thing
,
then
another
.
So
she
built
it
up
,
first
one
thing
and
then
another
.
Dancing
,
skipping
,
round
and
round
the
room
they
went
.
He
took
the
paper
.
Surrey
was
all
out
,
he
read
.
There
was
a
heat
wave
.
Rezia
repeated
:
Surrey
was
all
out
.
There
was
a
heat
wave
,
making
it
part
of
the
game
she
was
playing
with
Mrs.
Filmer
's
grandchild
,
both
of
them
laughing
,
chattering
at
the
same
time
,
at
their
game
.
He
was
very
tired
.
He
was
very
happy
.
He
would
sleep
.
He
shut
his
eyes
.
But
directly
he
saw
nothing
the
sounds
of
the
game
became
fainter
and
stranger
and
sounded
like
the
cries
of
people
seeking
and
not
finding
,
and
passing
further
and
further
away
.
They
had
lost
him
!
He
started
up
in
terror
.
What
did
he
see
?
The
plate
of
bananas
on
the
sideboard
.
Nobody
was
there
(
Rezia
had
taken
the
child
to
its
mother
.
It
was
bedtime
)
.
That
was
it
:
to
be
alone
forever
.
That
was
the
doom
pronounced
in
Milan
when
he
came
into
the
room
and
saw
them
cutting
out
buckram
shapes
with
their
scissors
;
to
be
alone
forever
.
He
was
alone
with
the
sideboard
and
the
bananas
.
He
was
alone
,
exposed
on
this
bleak
eminence
,
stretched
out
--
but
not
on
a
hill-top
;
not
on
a
crag
;
on
Mrs.
Filmer
's
sitting-room
sofa
.
As
for
the
visions
,
the
faces
,
the
voices
of
the
dead
,
where
were
they
?
There
was
a
screen
in
front
of
him
,
with
black
bulrushes
and
blue
swallows
.
Where
he
had
once
seen
mountains
,
where
he
had
seen
faces
,
where
he
had
seen
beauty
,
there
was
a
screen
.
``
Evans
!
''
he
cried
.
There
was
no
answer
.
A
mouse
had
squeaked
,
or
a
curtain
rustled
.
Those
were
the
voices
of
the
dead
.
The
screen
,
the
coalscuttle
,
the
sideboard
remained
to
him
.
Let
him
then
face
the
screen
,
the
coal-scuttle
and
the
sideboard
.
.
.
but
Rezia
burst
into
the
room
chattering
.
Some
letter
had
come
.
Everybody
's
plans
were
changed
.
Mrs.
Filmer
would
not
be
able
to
go
to
Brighton
after
all
.
There
was
no
time
to
let
Mrs.
Williams
know
,
and
really
Rezia
thought
it
very
,
very
annoying
,
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
hat
and
thought
.
.
.
perhaps
.
.
.
she
.
.
.
might
just
make
a
little
.
.
.
.
Her
voice
died
out
in
contented
melody
.
``
Ah
,
damn
!
''
she
cried
(
it
was
a
joke
of
theirs
,
her
swearing
)
,
the
needle
had
broken
.
Hat
,
child
,
Brighton
,
needle
.
She
built
it
up
;
first
one
thing
,
then
another
,
she
built
it
up
,
sewing
.
She
wanted
him
to
say
whether
by
moving
the
rose
she
had
improved
the
hat
.
She
sat
on
the
end
of
the
sofa
.
They
were
perfectly
happy
now
,
she
said
,
suddenly
,
putting
the
hat
down
.
For
she
could
say
anything
to
him
now
.
She
could
say
whatever
came
into
her
head
.
That
was
almost
the
first
thing
she
had
felt
about
him
,
that
night
in
the
café
when
he
had
come
in
with
his
English
friends
.
He
had
come
in
,
rather
shyly
,
looking
round
him
,
and
his
hat
had
fallen
when
he
hung
it
up
.
That
she
could
remember
.
She
knew
he
was
English
,
though
not
one
of
the
large
Englishmen
her
sister
admired
,
for
he
was
always
thin
;
but
he
had
a
beautiful
fresh
colour
;
and
with
his
big
nose
,
his
bright
eyes
,
his
way
of
sitting
a
little
hunched
made
her
think
,
she
had
often
told
him
,
of
a
young
hawk
,
that
first
evening
she
saw
him
,
when
they
were
playing
dominoes
,
and
he
had
come
in
--
of
a
young
hawk
;
but
with
her
he
was
always
very
gentle
.
She
had
never
seen
him
wild
or
drunk
,
only
suffering
sometimes
through
this
terrible
war
,
but
even
so
,
when
she
came
in
,
he
would
put
it
all
away
.
Anything
,
anything
in
the
whole
world
,
any
little
bother
with
her
work
,
anything
that
struck
her
to
say
she
would
tell
him
,
and
he
understood
at
once
.
Her
own
family
even
were
not
the
same
.
Being
older
than
she
was
and
being
so
clever
--
how
serious
he
was
,
wanting
her
to
read
Shakespeare
before
she
could
even
read
a
child
's
story
in
English
!
--
being
so
much
more
experienced
,
he
could
help
her
.
And
she
too
could
help
him
.
But
this
hat
now
.
And
then
(
it
was
getting
late
)
Sir
William
Bradshaw
.
She
held
her
hands
to
her
head
,
waiting
for
him
to
say
did
he
like
the
hat
or
not
,
and
as
she
sat
there
,
waiting
,
looking
down
,
he
could
feel
her
mind
,
like
a
bird
,
falling
from
branch
to
branch
,
and
always
alighting
,
quite
rightly
;
he
could
follow
her
mind
,
as
she
sat
there
in
one
of
those
loose
lax
poses
that
came
to
her
naturally
and
,
if
he
should
say
anything
,
at
once
she
smiled
,
like
a
bird
alighting
with
all
its
claws
firm
upon
the
bough
.
But
he
remembered
Bradshaw
said
,
``
The
people
we
are
most
fond
of
are
not
good
for
us
when
we
are
ill.
''
Bradshaw
said
,
he
must
be
taught
to
rest
.
Bradshaw
said
they
must
be
separated
.
``
Must
,
''
``
must
,
''
why
``
must
''
?
What
power
had
Bradshaw
over
him
?
``
What
right
has
Bradshaw
to
say
'must
'
to
me
?
''
he
demanded
.
``
It
is
because
you
talked
of
killing
yourself
,
''
said
Rezia
.
(
Mercifully
,
she
could
now
say
anything
to
Septimus
.
)
So
he
was
in
their
power
!
Holmes
and
Bradshaw
were
on
him
!
The
brute
with
the
red
nostrils
was
snuffing
into
every
secret
place
!
``
Must
''
it
could
say
!
Where
were
his
papers
?
the
things
he
had
written
?
She
brought
him
his
papers
,
the
things
he
had
written
,
things
she
had
written
for
him
.
She
tumbled
them
out
on
to
the
sofa
.
They
looked
at
them
together
.
Diagrams
,
designs
,
little
men
and
women
brandishing
sticks
for
arms
,
with
wings
--
were
they
?
--
on
their
backs
;
circles
traced
round
shillings
and
sixpences
--
the
suns
and
stars
;
zigzagging
precipices
with
mountaineers
ascending
roped
together
,
exactly
like
knives
and
forks
;
sea
pieces
with
little
faces
laughing
out
of
what
might
perhaps
be
waves
:
the
map
of
the
world
.
Burn
them
!
he
cried
.
Now
for
his
writings
;
how
the
dead
sing
behind
rhododendron
bushes
;
odes
to
Time
;
conversations
with
Shakespeare
;
Evans
,
Evans
,
Evans
--
his
messages
from
the
dead
;
do
not
cut
down
trees
;
tell
the
Prime
Minister
.
Universal
love
:
the
meaning
of
the
world
.
Burn
them
!
he
cried
.
But
Rezia
laid
her
hands
on
them
.
Some
were
very
beautiful
,
she
thought
.
She
would
tie
them
up
(
for
she
had
no
envelope
)
with
a
piece
of
silk
.
Even
if
they
took
him
,
she
said
,
she
would
go
with
him
.
They
could
not
separate
them
against
their
wills
,
she
said
.
Shuffling
the
edges
straight
,
she
did
up
the
papers
,
and
tied
the
parcel
almost
without
looking
,
sitting
beside
him
,
he
thought
,
as
if
all
her
petals
were
about
her
.
She
was
a
flowering
tree
;
and
through
her
branches
looked
out
the
face
of
a
lawgiver
,
who
had
reached
a
sanctuary
where
she
feared
no
one
;
not
Holmes
;
not
Bradshaw
;
a
miracle
,
a
triumph
,
the
last
and
greatest
.
Staggering
he
saw
her
mount
the
appalling
staircase
,
laden
with
Holmes
and
Bradshaw
,
men
who
never
weighed
less
than
eleven
stone
six
,
who
sent
their
wives
to
Court
,
men
who
made
ten
thousand
a
year
and
talked
of
proportion
;
who
different
in
their
verdicts
(
for
Holmes
said
one
thing
,
Bradshaw
another
)
,
yet
judges
they
were
;
who
mixed
the
vision
and
the
sideboard
;
saw
nothing
clear
,
yet
ruled
,
yet
inflicted
.
``
Must
''
they
said
.
Over
them
she
triumphed
.
``
There
!
''
she
said
.
The
papers
were
tied
up
.
No
one
should
get
at
them
.
She
would
put
them
away
.
And
,
she
said
,
nothing
should
separate
them
.
She
sat
down
beside
him
and
called
him
by
the
name
of
that
hawk
or
crow
which
being
malicious
and
a
great
destroyer
of
crops
was
precisely
like
him
.
No
one
could
separate
them
,
she
said
.
Then
she
got
up
to
go
into
the
bedroom
to
pack
their
things
,
but
hearing
voices
downstairs
and
thinking
that
Dr.
Holmes
had
perhaps
called
,
ran
down
to
prevent
him
coming
up
.
Septimus
could
hear
her
talking
to
Holmes
on
the
staircase
.
``
My
dear
lady
,
I
have
come
as
a
friend
,
''
Holmes
was
saying
.
``
No
.
I
will
not
allow
you
to
see
my
husband
,
''
she
said
.
He
could
see
her
,
like
a
little
hen
,
with
her
wings
spread
barring
his
passage
.
But
Holmes
persevered
.
``
My
dear
lady
,
allow
me
.
.
.
''
Holmes
said
,
putting
her
aside
(
Holmes
was
a
powerfully
built
man
)
.
Holmes
was
coming
upstairs
.
Holmes
would
burst
open
the
door
.
Holmes
would
say
``
In
a
funk
,
eh
?
''
Holmes
would
get
him
.
But
no
;
not
Holmes
;
not
Bradshaw
.
Getting
up
rather
unsteadily
,
hopping
indeed
from
foot
to
foot
,
he
considered
Mrs.
Filmer
's
nice
clean
bread
knife
with
``
Bread
''
carved
on
the
handle
.
Ah
,
but
one
must
n't
spoil
that
.
The
gas
fire
?
But
it
was
too
late
now
.
Holmes
was
coming
.
Razors
he
might
have
got
,
but
Rezia
,
who
always
did
that
sort
of
thing
,
had
packed
them
.
There
remained
only
the
window
,
the
large
Bloomsbury-lodging
house
window
,
the
tiresome
,
the
troublesome
,
and
rather
melodramatic
business
of
opening
the
window
and
throwing
himself
out
.
It
was
their
idea
of
tragedy
,
not
his
or
Rezia
's
(
for
she
was
with
him
)
.
Holmes
and
Bradshaw
like
that
sort
of
thing
.
(
He
sat
on
the
sill
.
)
But
he
would
wait
till
the
very
last
moment
.
He
did
not
want
to
die
.
Life
was
good
.
The
sun
hot
.
Only
human
beings
--
what
did
they
want
?
Coming
down
the
staircase
opposite
an
old
man
stopped
and
stared
at
him
.
Holmes
was
at
the
door
.
``
I
'll
give
it
you
!
''
he
cried
,
and
flung
himself
vigorously
,
violently
down
on
to
Mrs.
Filmer
's
area
railings
.
``
The
coward
!
''
cried
Dr.
Holmes
,
bursting
the
door
open
.
Rezia
ran
to
the
window
,
she
saw
;
she
understood
.
Dr.
Holmes
and
Mrs.
Filmer
collided
with
each
other
.
Mrs.
Filmer
flapped
her
apron
and
made
her
hide
her
eyes
in
the
bedroom
.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
running
up
and
down
stairs
.
Dr.
Holmes
came
in
--
white
as
a
sheet
,
shaking
all
over
,
with
a
glass
in
his
hand
.
She
must
be
brave
and
drink
something
,
he
said
(
What
was
it
?
Something
sweet
)
,
for
her
husband
was
horribly
mangled
,
would
not
recover
consciousness
,
she
must
not
see
him
,
must
be
spared
as
much
as
possible
,
would
have
the
inquest
to
go
through
,
poor
young
woman
.
Who
could
have
foretold
it
?
A
sudden
impulse
,
no
one
was
in
the
least
to
blame
(
he
told
Mrs.
Filmer
)
.
And
why
the
devil
he
did
it
,
Dr.
Holmes
could
not
conceive
.
It
seemed
to
her
as
she
drank
the
sweet
stuff
that
she
was
opening
long
windows
,
stepping
out
into
some
garden
.
But
where
?
The
clock
was
striking
--
one
,
two
,
three
:
how
sensible
the
sound
was
;
compared
with
all
this
thumping
and
whispering
;
like
Septimus
himself
.
She
was
falling
asleep
.
But
the
clock
went
on
striking
,
four
,
five
,
six
and
Mrs.
Filmer
waving
her
apron
(
they
would
n't
bring
the
body
in
here
,
would
they
?
)
seemed
part
of
that
garden
;
or
a
flag
.
She
had
once
seen
a
flag
slowly
rippling
out
from
a
mast
when
she
stayed
with
her
aunt
at
Venice
.
Men
killed
in
battle
were
thus
saluted
,
and
Septimus
had
been
through
the
War
.
Of
her
memories
,
most
were
happy
.
She
put
on
her
hat
,
and
ran
through
cornfields
--
where
could
it
have
been
?
--
on
to
some
hill
,
somewhere
near
the
sea
,
for
there
were
ships
,
gulls
,
butterflies
;
they
sat
on
a
cliff
.
In
London
too
,
there
they
sat
,
and
,
half
dreaming
,
came
to
her
through
the
bedroom
door
,
rain
falling
,
whisperings
,
stirrings
among
dry
corn
,
the
caress
of
the
sea
,
as
it
seemed
to
her
,
hollowing
them
in
its
arched
shell
and
murmuring
to
her
laid
on
shore
,
strewn
she
felt
,
like
flying
flowers
over
some
tomb
.
``
He
is
dead
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
at
the
poor
old
woman
who
guarded
her
with
her
honest
light-blue
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
.
(
They
would
n't
bring
him
in
here
,
would
they
?
)
But
Mrs.
Filmer
pooh-poohed
.
Oh
no
,
oh
no
!
They
were
carrying
him
away
now
.
Ought
she
not
to
be
told
?
Married
people
ought
to
be
together
,
Mrs.
Filmer
thought
.
But
they
must
do
as
the
doctor
said
.
``
Let
her
sleep
,
''
said
Dr.
Holmes
,
feeling
her
pulse
.
She
saw
the
large
outline
of
his
body
standing
dark
against
the
window
.
So
that
was
Dr.
Holmes
.
One
of
the
triumphs
of
civilisation
,
Peter
Walsh
thought
.
It
is
one
of
the
triumphs
of
civilisation
,
as
the
light
high
bell
of
the
ambulance
sounded
.
Swiftly
,
cleanly
the
ambulance
sped
to
the
hospital
,
having
picked
up
instantly
,
humanely
,
some
poor
devil
;
some
one
hit
on
the
head
,
struck
down
by
disease
,
knocked
over
perhaps
a
minute
or
so
ago
at
one
of
these
crossings
,
as
might
happen
to
oneself
.
That
was
civilisation
.
It
struck
him
coming
back
from
the
East
--
the
efficiency
,
the
organisation
,
the
communal
spirit
of
London
.
Every
cart
or
carriage
of
its
own
accord
drew
aside
to
let
the
ambulance
pass
.
Perhaps
it
was
morbid
;
or
was
it
not
touching
rather
,
the
respect
which
they
showed
this
ambulance
with
its
victim
inside
--
busy
men
hurrying
home
yet
instantly
bethinking
them
as
it
passed
of
some
wife
;
or
presumably
how
easily
it
might
have
been
them
there
,
stretched
on
a
shelf
with
a
doctor
and
a
nurse
.
.
.
.
Ah
,
but
thinking
became
morbid
,
sentimental
,
directly
one
began
conjuring
up
doctors
,
dead
bodies
;
a
little
glow
of
pleasure
,
a
sort
of
lust
too
over
the
visual
impression
warned
one
not
to
go
on
with
that
sort
of
thing
any
more
--
fatal
to
art
,
fatal
to
friendship
.
True
.
And
yet
,
thought
Peter
Walsh
,
as
the
ambulance
turned
the
corner
though
the
light
high
bell
could
be
heard
down
the
next
street
and
still
farther
as
it
crossed
the
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
chiming
constantly
,
it
is
the
privilege
of
loneliness
;
in
privacy
one
may
do
as
one
chooses
.
One
might
weep
if
no
one
saw
.
It
had
been
his
undoing
--
this
susceptibility
--
in
Anglo-Indian
society
;
not
weeping
at
the
right
time
,
or
laughing
either
.
I
have
that
in
me
,
he
thought
standing
by
the
pillar-box
,
which
could
now
dissolve
in
tears
.
Why
,
Heaven
knows
.
Beauty
of
some
sort
probably
,
and
the
weight
of
the
day
,
which
beginning
with
that
visit
to
Clarissa
had
exhausted
him
with
its
heat
,
its
intensity
,
and
the
drip
,
drip
,
of
one
impression
after
another
down
into
that
cellar
where
they
stood
,
deep
,
dark
,
and
no
one
would
ever
know
.
Partly
for
that
reason
,
its
secrecy
,
complete
and
inviolable
,
he
had
found
life
like
an
unknown
garden
,
full
of
turns
and
corners
,
surprising
,
yes
;
really
it
took
one
's
breath
away
,
these
moments
;
there
coming
to
him
by
the
pillar-box
opposite
the
British
Museum
one
of
them
,
a
moment
,
in
which
things
came
together
;
this
ambulance
;
and
life
and
death
.
It
was
as
if
he
were
sucked
up
to
some
very
high
roof
by
that
rush
of
emotion
and
the
rest
of
him
,
like
a
white
shell-sprinkled
beach
,
left
bare
.
It
had
been
his
undoing
in
Anglo-Indian
society
--
this
susceptibility
.
Clarissa
once
,
going
on
top
of
an
omnibus
with
him
somewhere
,
Clarissa
superficially
at
least
,
so
easily
moved
,
now
in
despair
,
now
in
the
best
of
spirits
,
all
aquiver
in
those
days
and
such
good
company
,
spotting
queer
little
scenes
,
names
,
people
from
the
top
of
a
bus
,
for
they
used
to
explore
London
and
bring
back
bags
full
of
treasures
from
the
Caledonian
market
--
Clarissa
had
a
theory
in
those
days
--
they
had
heaps
of
theories
,
always
theories
,
as
young
people
have
.
It
was
to
explain
the
feeling
they
had
of
dissatisfaction
;
not
knowing
people
;
not
being
known
.
For
how
could
they
know
each
other
?
You
met
every
day
;
then
not
for
six
months
,
or
years
.
It
was
unsatisfactory
,
they
agreed
,
how
little
one
knew
people
.
But
she
said
,
sitting
on
the
bus
going
up
Shaftesbury
Avenue
,
she
felt
herself
everywhere
;
not
``
here
,
here
,
here
''
;
and
she
tapped
the
back
of
the
seat
;
but
everywhere
.
She
waved
her
hand
,
going
up
Shaftesbury
Avenue
.
She
was
all
that
.
So
that
to
know
her
,
or
any
one
,
one
must
seek
out
the
people
who
completed
them
;
even
the
places
.
Odd
affinities
she
had
with
people
she
had
never
spoken
to
,
some
woman
in
the
street
,
some
man
behind
a
counter
--
even
trees
,
or
barns
.
It
ended
in
a
transcendental
theory
which
,
with
her
horror
of
death
,
allowed
her
to
believe
,
or
say
that
she
believed
(
for
all
her
scepticism
)
,
that
since
our
apparitions
,
the
part
of
us
which
appears
,
are
so
momentary
compared
with
the
other
,
the
unseen
part
of
us
,
which
spreads
wide
,
the
unseen
might
survive
,
be
recovered
somehow
attached
to
this
person
or
that
,
or
even
haunting
certain
places
after
death
.
.
.
perhaps
--
perhaps
.
Looking
back
over
that
long
friendship
of
almost
thirty
years
her
theory
worked
to
this
extent
.
Brief
,
broken
,
often
painful
as
their
actual
meetings
had
been
what
with
his
absences
and
interruptions
(
this
morning
,
for
instance
,
in
came
Elizabeth
,
like
a
long-legged
colt
,
handsome
,
dumb
,
just
as
he
was
beginning
to
talk
to
Clarissa
)
the
effect
of
them
on
his
life
was
immeasurable
.
There
was
a
mystery
about
it
.
You
were
given
a
sharp
,
acute
,
uncomfortable
grain
--
the
actual
meeting
;
horribly
painful
as
often
as
not
;
yet
in
absence
,
in
the
most
unlikely
places
,
it
would
flower
out
,
open
,
shed
its
scent
,
let
you
touch
,
taste
,
look
about
you
,
get
the
whole
feel
of
it
and
understanding
,
after
years
of
lying
lost
.
Thus
she
had
come
to
him
;
on
board
ship
;
in
the
Himalayas
;
suggested
by
the
oddest
things
(
so
Sally
Seton
,
generous
,
enthusiastic
goose
!
thought
of
him
when
she
saw
blue
hydrangeas
)
.
She
had
influenced
him
more
than
any
person
he
had
ever
known
.
And
always
in
this
way
coming
before
him
without
his
wishing
it
,
cool
,
lady-like
,
critical
;
or
ravishing
,
romantic
,
recalling
some
field
or
English
harvest
.
He
saw
her
most
often
in
the
country
,
not
in
London
.
One
scene
after
another
at
Bourton
.
.
.
.
He
had
reached
his
hotel
.
He
crossed
the
hall
,
with
its
mounds
of
reddish
chairs
and
sofas
,
its
spike-leaved
,
withered-looking
plants
.
He
got
his
key
off
the
hook
.
The
young
lady
handed
him
some
letters
.
He
went
upstairs
--
he
saw
her
most
often
at
Bourton
,
in
the
late
summer
,
when
he
stayed
there
for
a
week
,
or
fortnight
even
,
as
people
did
in
those
days
.
First
on
top
of
some
hill
there
she
would
stand
,
hands
clapped
to
her
hair
,
her
cloak
blowing
out
,
pointing
,
crying
to
them
--
she
saw
the
Severn
beneath
.
Or
in
a
wood
,
making
the
kettle
boil
--
very
ineffective
with
her
fingers
;
the
smoke
curtseying
,
blowing
in
their
faces
;
her
little
pink
face
showing
through
;
begging
water
from
an
old
woman
in
a
cottage
,
who
came
to
the
door
to
watch
them
go
.
They
walked
always
;
the
others
drove
.
She
was
bored
driving
,
disliked
all
animals
,
except
that
dog
.
They
tramped
miles
along
roads
.
She
would
break
off
to
get
her
bearings
,
pilot
him
back
across
country
;
and
all
the
time
they
argued
,
discussed
poetry
,
discussed
people
,
discussed
politics
(
she
was
a
Radical
then
)
;
never
noticing
a
thing
except
when
she
stopped
,
cried
out
at
a
view
or
a
tree
,
and
made
him
look
with
her
;
and
so
on
again
,
through
stubble
fields
,
she
walking
ahead
,
with
a
flower
for
her
aunt
,
never
tired
of
walking
for
all
her
delicacy
;
to
drop
down
on
Bourton
in
the
dusk
.
Then
,
after
dinner
,
old
Breitkopf
would
open
the
piano
and
sing
without
any
voice
,
and
they
would
lie
sunk
in
arm-chairs
,
trying
not
to
laugh
,
but
always
breaking
down
and
laughing
,
laughing
--
laughing
at
nothing
.
Breitkopf
was
supposed
not
to
see
.
And
then
in
the
morning
,
flirting
up
and
down
like
a
wagtail
in
front
of
the
house
.
.
.
.
Oh
it
was
a
letter
from
her
!
This
blue
envelope
;
that
was
her
hand
.
And
he
would
have
to
read
it
.
Here
was
another
of
those
meetings
,
bound
to
be
painful
!
To
read
her
letter
needed
the
devil
of
an
effort
.
``
How
heavenly
it
was
to
see
him
.
She
must
tell
him
that
.
''
That
was
all
.
But
it
upset
him
.
It
annoyed
him
.
He
wished
she
had
n't
written
it
.
Coming
on
top
of
his
thoughts
,
it
was
like
a
nudge
in
the
ribs
.
Why
could
n't
she
let
him
be
?
After
all
,
she
had
married
Dalloway
,
and
lived
with
him
in
perfect
happiness
all
these
years
.
These
hotels
are
not
consoling
places
.
Far
from
it
.
Any
number
of
people
had
hung
up
their
hats
on
those
pegs
.
Even
the
flies
,
if
you
thought
of
it
,
had
settled
on
other
people
's
noses
.
As
for
the
cleanliness
which
hit
him
in
the
face
,
it
was
n't
cleanliness
,
so
much
as
bareness
,
frigidity
;
a
thing
that
had
to
be
.
Some
arid
matron
made
her
rounds
at
dawn
sniffing
,
peering
,
causing
blue-nosed
maids
to
scour
,
for
all
the
world
as
if
the
next
visitor
were
a
joint
of
meat
to
be
served
on
a
perfectly
clean
platter
.
For
sleep
,
one
bed
;
for
sitting
in
,
one
armchair
;
for
cleaning
one
's
teeth
and
shaving
one
's
chin
,
one
tumbler
,
one
looking-glass
.
Books
,
letters
,
dressing-gown
,
slipped
about
on
the
impersonality
of
the
horsehair
like
incongruous
impertinences
.
And
it
was
Clarissa
's
letter
that
made
him
see
all
this
.
``
Heavenly
to
see
you
.
She
must
say
so
!
''
He
folded
the
paper
;
pushed
it
away
;
nothing
would
induce
him
to
read
it
again
!
To
get
that
letter
to
him
by
six
o'clock
she
must
have
sat
down
and
written
it
directly
he
left
her
;
stamped
it
;
sent
somebody
to
the
post
.
It
was
,
as
people
say
,
very
like
her
.
She
was
upset
by
his
visit
.
She
had
felt
a
great
deal
;
had
for
a
moment
,
when
she
kissed
his
hand
,
regretted
,
envied
him
even
,
remembered
possibly
(
for
he
saw
her
look
it
)
something
he
had
said
--
how
they
would
change
the
world
if
she
married
him
perhaps
;
whereas
,
it
was
this
;
it
was
middle
age
;
it
was
mediocrity
;
then
forced
herself
with
her
indomitable
vitality
to
put
all
that
aside
,
there
being
in
her
a
thread
of
life
which
for
toughness
,
endurance
,
power
to
overcome
obstacles
,
and
carry
her
triumphantly
through
he
had
never
known
the
like
of
.
Yes
;
but
there
would
come
a
reaction
directly
he
left
the
room
.
She
would
be
frightfully
sorry
for
him
;
she
would
think
what
in
the
world
she
could
do
to
give
him
pleasure
(
short
always
of
the
one
thing
)
and
he
could
see
her
with
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
going
to
her
writing-table
and
dashing
off
that
one
line
which
he
was
to
find
greeting
him
.
.
.
.
``
Heavenly
to
see
you
!
''
And
she
meant
it
.
Peter
Walsh
had
now
unlaced
his
boots
.
But
it
would
not
have
been
a
success
,
their
marriage
.
The
other
thing
,
after
all
,
came
so
much
more
naturally
.
It
was
odd
;
it
was
true
;
lots
of
people
felt
it
.
Peter
Walsh
,
who
had
done
just
respectably
,
filled
the
usual
posts
adequately
,
was
liked
,
but
thought
a
little
cranky
,
gave
himself
airs
--
it
was
odd
that
he
should
have
had
,
especially
now
that
his
hair
was
grey
,
a
contented
look
;
a
look
of
having
reserves
.
It
was
this
that
made
him
attractive
to
women
who
liked
the
sense
that
he
was
not
altogether
manly
.
There
was
something
unusual
about
him
,
or
something
behind
him
.
It
might
be
that
he
was
bookish
--
never
came
to
see
you
without
taking
up
the
book
on
the
table
(
he
was
now
reading
,
with
his
bootlaces
trailing
on
the
floor
)
;
or
that
he
was
a
gentleman
,
which
showed
itself
in
the
way
he
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
,
and
in
his
manners
of
course
to
women
.
For
it
was
very
charming
and
quite
ridiculous
how
easily
some
girl
without
a
grain
of
sense
could
twist
him
round
her
finger
.
But
at
her
own
risk
.
That
is
to
say
,
though
he
might
be
ever
so
easy
,
and
indeed
with
his
gaiety
and
good-breeding
fascinating
to
be
with
,
it
was
only
up
to
a
point
.
She
said
something
--
no
,
no
;
he
saw
through
that
.
He
would
n't
stand
that
--
no
,
no
.
Then
he
could
shout
and
rock
and
hold
his
sides
together
over
some
joke
with
men
.
He
was
the
best
judge
of
cooking
in
India
.
He
was
a
man
.
But
not
the
sort
of
man
one
had
to
respect
--
which
was
a
mercy
;
not
like
Major
Simmons
,
for
instance
;
not
in
the
least
like
that
,
Daisy
thought
,
when
,
in
spite
of
her
two
small
children
,
she
used
to
compare
them
.
He
pulled
off
his
boots
.
He
emptied
his
pockets
.
Out
came
with
his
pocket-knife
a
snapshot
of
Daisy
on
the
verandah
;
Daisy
all
in
white
,
with
a
fox-terrier
on
her
knee
;
very
charming
,
very
dark
;
the
best
he
had
ever
seen
of
her
.
It
did
come
,
after
all
so
naturally
;
so
much
more
naturally
than
Clarissa
.
No
fuss
.
No
bother
.
No
finicking
and
fidgeting
.
All
plain
sailing
.
And
the
dark
,
adorably
pretty
girl
on
the
verandah
exclaimed
(
he
could
hear
her
)
.
Of
course
,
of
course
she
would
give
him
everything
!
she
cried
(
she
had
no
sense
of
discretion
)
everything
he
wanted
!
she
cried
,
running
to
meet
him
,
whoever
might
be
looking
.
And
she
was
only
twenty-four
.
And
she
had
two
children
.
Well
,
well
!
Well
indeed
he
had
got
himself
into
a
mess
at
his
age
.
And
it
came
over
him
when
he
woke
in
the
night
pretty
forcibly
.
Suppose
they
did
marry
?
For
him
it
would
be
all
very
well
,
but
what
about
her
?
Mrs.
Burgess
,
a
good
sort
and
no
chatterbox
,
in
whom
he
had
confided
,
thought
this
absence
of
his
in
England
,
ostensibly
to
see
lawyers
might
serve
to
make
Daisy
reconsider
,
think
what
it
meant
.
It
was
a
question
of
her
position
,
Mrs.
Burgess
said
;
the
social
barrier
;
giving
up
her
children
.
She
'd
be
a
widow
with
a
past
one
of
these
days
,
draggling
about
in
the
suburbs
,
or
more
likely
,
indiscriminate
(
you
know
,
she
said
,
what
such
women
get
like
,
with
too
much
paint
)
.
But
Peter
Walsh
pooh-poohed
all
that
.
He
did
n't
mean
to
die
yet
.
Anyhow
she
must
settle
for
herself
;
judge
for
herself
,
he
thought
,
padding
about
the
room
in
his
socks
,
smoothing
out
his
dress-shirt
,
for
he
might
go
to
Clarissa
's
party
,
or
he
might
go
to
one
of
the
Halls
,
or
he
might
settle
in
and
read
an
absorbing
book
written
by
a
man
he
used
to
know
at
Oxford
.
And
if
he
did
retire
,
that
's
what
he
'd
do
--
write
books
.
He
would
go
to
Oxford
and
poke
about
in
the
Bodleian
.
Vainly
the
dark
,
adorably
pretty
girl
ran
to
the
end
of
the
terrace
;
vainly
waved
her
hand
;
vainly
cried
she
did
n't
care
a
straw
what
people
said
.
There
he
was
,
the
man
she
thought
the
world
of
,
the
perfect
gentleman
,
the
fascinating
,
the
distinguished
(
and
his
age
made
not
the
least
difference
to
her
)
,
padding
about
a
room
in
an
hotel
in
Bloomsbury
,
shaving
,
washing
,
continuing
,
as
he
took
up
cans
,
put
down
razors
,
to
poke
about
in
the
Bodleian
,
and
get
at
the
truth
about
one
or
two
little
matters
that
interested
him
.
And
he
would
have
a
chat
with
whoever
it
might
be
,
and
so
come
to
disregard
more
and
more
precise
hours
for
lunch
,
and
miss
engagements
,
and
when
Daisy
asked
him
,
as
she
would
,
for
a
kiss
,
a
scene
,
fail
to
come
up
to
the
scratch
(
though
he
was
genuinely
devoted
to
her
)
--
in
short
it
might
be
happier
,
as
Mrs.
Burgess
said
,
that
she
should
forget
him
,
or
merely
remember
him
as
he
was
in
August
1922
,
like
a
figure
standing
at
the
cross
roads
at
dusk
,
which
grows
more
and
more
remote
as
the
dog-cart
spins
away
,
carrying
her
securely
fastened
to
the
back
seat
,
though
her
arms
are
outstretched
,
and
as
she
sees
the
figure
dwindle
and
disappear
still
she
cries
out
how
she
would
do
anything
in
the
world
,
anything
,
anything
,
anything
.
.
.
.
He
never
knew
what
people
thought
.
It
became
more
and
more
difficult
for
him
to
concentrate
.
He
became
absorbed
;
he
became
busied
with
his
own
concerns
;
now
surly
,
now
gay
;
dependent
on
women
,
absent-minded
,
moody
,
less
and
less
able
(
so
he
thought
as
he
shaved
)
to
understand
why
Clarissa
could
n't
simply
find
them
a
lodging
and
be
nice
to
Daisy
;
introduce
her
.
And
then
he
could
just
--
just
do
what
?
just
haunt
and
hover
(
he
was
at
the
moment
actually
engaged
in
sorting
out
various
keys
,
papers
)
,
swoop
and
taste
,
be
alone
,
in
short
,
sufficient
to
himself
;
and
yet
nobody
of
course
was
more
dependent
upon
others
(
he
buttoned
his
waistcoat
)
;
it
had
been
his
undoing
.
He
could
not
keep
out
of
smoking-rooms
,
liked
colonels
,
liked
golf
,
liked
bridge
,
and
above
all
women
's
society
,
and
the
fineness
of
their
companionship
,
and
their
faithfulness
and
audacity
and
greatness
in
loving
which
though
it
had
its
drawbacks
seemed
to
him
(
and
the
dark
,
adorably
pretty
face
was
on
top
of
the
envelopes
)
so
wholly
admirable
,
so
splendid
a
flower
to
grow
on
the
crest
of
human
life
,
and
yet
he
could
not
come
up
to
the
scratch
,
being
always
apt
to
see
round
things
(
Clarissa
had
sapped
something
in
him
permanently
)
,
and
to
tire
very
easily
of
mute
devotion
and
to
want
variety
in
love
,
though
it
would
make
him
furious
if
Daisy
loved
anybody
else
,
furious
!
for
he
was
jealous
,
uncontrollably
jealous
by
temperament
.
He
suffered
tortures
!
But
where
was
his
knife
;
his
watch
;
his
seals
,
his
note-case
,
and
Clarissa
's
letter
which
he
would
not
read
again
but
liked
to
think
of
,
and
Daisy
's
photograph
?
And
now
for
dinner
.
They
were
eating
.
Sitting
at
little
tables
round
vases
,
dressed
or
not
dressed
,
with
their
shawls
and
bags
laid
beside
them
,
with
their
air
of
false
composure
,
for
they
were
not
used
to
so
many
courses
at
dinner
,
and
confidence
,
for
they
were
able
to
pay
for
it
,
and
strain
,
for
they
had
been
running
about
London
all
day
shopping
,
sightseeing
;
and
their
natural
curiosity
,
for
they
looked
round
and
up
as
the
nice-looking
gentleman
in
horn-rimmed
spectacles
came
in
,
and
their
good
nature
,
for
they
would
have
been
glad
to
do
any
little
service
,
such
as
lend
a
time-table
or
impart
useful
information
,
and
their
desire
,
pulsing
in
them
,
tugging
at
them
subterraneously
,
somehow
to
establish
connections
if
it
were
only
a
birthplace
(
Liverpool
,
for
example
)
in
common
or
friends
of
the
same
name
;
with
their
furtive
glances
,
odd
silences
,
and
sudden
withdrawals
into
family
jocularity
and
isolation
;
there
they
sat
eating
dinner
when
Mr.
Walsh
came
in
and
took
his
seat
at
a
little
table
by
the
curtain
.
It
was
not
that
he
said
anything
,
for
being
solitary
he
could
only
address
himself
to
the
waiter
;
it
was
his
way
of
looking
at
the
menu
,
of
pointing
his
forefinger
to
a
particular
wine
,
of
hitching
himself
up
to
the
table
,
of
addressing
himself
seriously
,
not
gluttonously
to
dinner
,
that
won
him
their
respect
;
which
,
having
to
remain
unexpressed
for
the
greater
part
of
the
meal
,
flared
up
at
the
table
where
the
Morrises
sat
when
Mr.
Walsh
was
heard
to
say
at
the
end
of
the
meal
,
``
Bartlett
pears
.
''
Why
he
should
have
spoken
so
moderately
yet
firmly
,
with
the
air
of
a
disciplinarian
well
within
his
rights
which
are
founded
upon
justice
,
neither
young
Charles
Morris
,
nor
old
Charles
,
neither
Miss
Elaine
nor
Mrs.
Morris
knew
.
But
when
he
said
,
``
Bartlett
pears
,
''
sitting
alone
at
his
table
,
they
felt
that
he
counted
on
their
support
in
some
lawful
demand
;
was
champion
of
a
cause
which
immediately
became
their
own
,
so
that
their
eyes
met
his
eyes
sympathetically
,
and
when
they
all
reached
the
smoking-room
simultaneously
,
a
little
talk
between
them
became
inevitable
.
It
was
not
very
profound
--
only
to
the
effect
that
London
was
crowded
;
had
changed
in
thirty
years
;
that
Mr.
Morris
preferred
Liverpool
;
that
Mrs.
Morris
had
been
to
the
Westminster
flower-show
,
and
that
they
had
all
seen
the
Prince
of
Wales
.
Yet
,
thought
Peter
Walsh
,
no
family
in
the
world
can
compare
with
the
Morrises
;
none
whatever
;
and
their
relations
to
each
other
are
perfect
,
and
they
do
n't
care
a
hang
for
the
upper
classes
,
and
they
like
what
they
like
,
and
Elaine
is
training
for
the
family
business
,
and
the
boy
has
won
a
scholarship
at
Leeds
,
and
the
old
lady
(
who
is
about
his
own
age
)
has
three
more
children
at
home
;
and
they
have
two
motor
cars
,
but
Mr.
Morris
still
mends
the
boots
on
Sunday
:
it
is
superb
,
it
is
absolutely
superb
,
thought
Peter
Walsh
,
swaying
a
little
backwards
and
forwards
with
his
liqueur
glass
in
his
hand
among
the
hairy
red
chairs
and
ash-trays
,
feeling
very
well
pleased
with
himself
,
for
the
Morrises
liked
him
.
Yes
,
they
liked
a
man
who
said
,
``
Bartlett
pears
.
''
They
liked
him
,
he
felt
.
He
would
go
to
Clarissa
's
party
.
(
The
Morrises
moved
off
;
but
they
would
meet
again
.
)
He
would
go
to
Clarissa
's
party
,
because
he
wanted
to
ask
Richard
what
they
were
doing
in
India
--
the
conservative
duffers
.
And
what
's
being
acted
?
And
music
.
.
.
.
Oh
yes
,
and
mere
gossip
.
For
this
is
the
truth
about
our
soul
,
he
thought
,
our
self
,
who
fish-like
inhabits
deep
seas
and
plies
among
obscurities
threading
her
way
between
the
boles
of
giant
weeds
,
over
sun-flickered
spaces
and
on
and
on
into
gloom
,
cold
,
deep
,
inscrutable
;
suddenly
she
shoots
to
the
surface
and
sports
on
the
wind-wrinkled
waves
;
that
is
,
has
a
positive
need
to
brush
,
scrape
,
kindle
herself
,
gossiping
.
What
did
the
Government
mean
--
Richard
Dalloway
would
know
--
to
do
about
India
?
Since
it
was
a
very
hot
night
and
the
paper
boys
went
by
with
placards
proclaiming
in
huge
red
letters
that
there
was
a
heat-wave
,
wicker
chairs
were
placed
on
the
hotel
steps
and
there
,
sipping
,
smoking
,
detached
gentlemen
sat
.
Peter
Walsh
sat
there
.
One
might
fancy
that
day
,
the
London
day
,
was
just
beginning
.
Like
a
woman
who
had
slipped
off
her
print
dress
and
white
apron
to
array
herself
in
blue
and
pearls
,
the
day
changed
,
put
off
stuff
,
took
gauze
,
changed
to
evening
,
and
with
the
same
sigh
of
exhilaration
that
a
woman
breathes
,
tumbling
petticoats
on
the
floor
,
it
too
shed
dust
,
heat
,
colour
;
the
traffic
thinned
;
motor
cars
,
tinkling
,
darting
,
succeeded
the
lumber
of
vans
;
and
here
and
there
among
the
thick
foliage
of
the
squares
an
intense
light
hung
.
I
resign
,
the
evening
seemed
to
say
,
as
it
paled
and
faded
above
the
battlements
and
prominences
,
moulded
,
pointed
,
of
hotel
,
flat
,
and
block
of
shops
,
I
fade
,
she
was
beginning
,
I
disappear
,
but
London
would
have
none
of
it
,
and
rushed
her
bayonets
into
the
sky
,
pinioned
her
,
constrained
her
to
partnership
in
her
revelry
.
For
the
great
revolution
of
Mr.
Willett
's
summer
time
had
taken
place
since
Peter
Walsh
's
last
visit
to
England
.
The
prolonged
evening
was
new
to
him
.
It
was
inspiriting
,
rather
.
For
as
the
young
people
went
by
with
their
despatch-boxes
,
awfully
glad
to
be
free
,
proud
too
,
dumbly
,
of
stepping
this
famous
pavement
,
joy
of
a
kind
,
cheap
,
tinselly
,
if
you
like
,
but
all
the
same
rapture
,
flushed
their
faces
.
They
dressed
well
too
;
pink
stockings
;
pretty
shoes
.
They
would
now
have
two
hours
at
the
pictures
.
It
sharpened
,
it
refined
them
,
the
yellow-blue
evening
light
;
and
on
the
leaves
in
the
square
shone
lurid
,
livid
--
they
looked
as
if
dipped
in
sea
water
--
the
foliage
of
a
submerged
city
.
He
was
astonished
by
the
beauty
;
it
was
encouraging
too
,
for
where
the
returned
Anglo-Indian
sat
by
rights
(
he
knew
crowds
of
them
)
in
the
Oriental
Club
biliously
summing
up
the
ruin
of
the
world
,
here
was
he
,
as
young
as
ever
;
envying
young
people
their
summer
time
and
the
rest
of
it
,
and
more
than
suspecting
from
the
words
of
a
girl
,
from
a
housemaid
's
laughter
--
intangible
things
you
could
n't
lay
your
hands
on
--
that
shift
in
the
whole
pyramidal
accumulation
which
in
his
youth
had
seemed
immovable
.
On
top
of
them
it
had
pressed
;
weighed
them
down
,
the
women
especially
,
like
those
flowers
Clarissa
's
Aunt
Helena
used
to
press
between
sheets
of
grey
blotting-paper
with
Littré
's
dictionary
on
top
,
sitting
under
the
lamp
after
dinner
.
She
was
dead
now
.
He
had
heard
of
her
,
from
Clarissa
,
losing
the
sight
of
one
eye
.
It
seemed
so
fitting
--
one
of
nature
's
masterpieces
--
that
old
Miss
Parry
should
turn
to
glass
.
She
would
die
like
some
bird
in
a
frost
gripping
her
perch
.
She
belonged
to
a
different
age
,
but
being
so
entire
,
so
complete
,
would
always
stand
up
on
the
horizon
,
stone-white
,
eminent
,
like
a
lighthouse
marking
some
past
stage
on
this
adventurous
,
long
,
long
voyage
,
this
interminable
(
he
felt
for
a
copper
to
buy
a
paper
and
read
about
Surrey
and
Yorkshire
--
he
had
held
out
that
copper
millions
of
times
.
Surrey
was
all
out
once
more
)
--
this
interminable
life
.
But
cricket
was
no
mere
game
.
Cricket
was
important
.
He
could
never
help
reading
about
cricket
.
He
read
the
scores
in
the
stop
press
first
,
then
how
it
was
a
hot
day
;
then
about
a
murder
case
.
Having
done
things
millions
of
times
enriched
them
,
though
it
might
be
said
to
take
the
surface
off
.
The
past
enriched
,
and
experience
,
and
having
cared
for
one
or
two
people
,
and
so
having
acquired
the
power
which
the
young
lack
,
of
cutting
short
,
doing
what
one
likes
,
not
caring
a
rap
what
people
say
and
coming
and
going
without
any
very
great
expectations
(
he
left
his
paper
on
the
table
and
moved
off
)
,
which
however
(
and
he
looked
for
his
hat
and
coat
)
was
not
altogether
true
of
him
,
not
to-night
,
for
here
he
was
starting
to
go
to
a
party
,
at
his
age
,
with
the
belief
upon
him
that
he
was
about
to
have
an
experience
.
But
what
?
Beauty
anyhow
.
Not
the
crude
beauty
of
the
eye
.
It
was
not
beauty
pure
and
simple
--
Bedford
Place
leading
into
Russell
Square
.
It
was
straightness
and
emptiness
of
course
;
the
symmetry
of
a
corridor
;
but
it
was
also
windows
lit
up
,
a
piano
,
a
gramophone
sounding
;
a
sense
of
pleasure-making
hidden
,
but
now
and
again
emerging
when
,
through
the
uncurtained
window
,
the
window
left
open
,
one
saw
parties
sitting
over
tables
,
young
people
slowly
circling
,
conversations
between
men
and
women
,
maids
idly
looking
out
(
a
strange
comment
theirs
,
when
work
was
done
)
,
stockings
drying
on
top
ledges
,
a
parrot
,
a
few
plants
.
Absorbing
,
mysterious
,
of
infinite
richness
,
this
life
.
And
in
the
large
square
where
the
cabs
shot
and
swerved
so
quick
,
there
were
loitering
couples
,
dallying
,
embracing
,
shrunk
up
under
the
shower
of
a
tree
;
that
was
moving
;
so
silent
,
so
absorbed
,
that
one
passed
,
discreetly
,
timidly
,
as
if
in
the
presence
of
some
sacred
ceremony
to
interrupt
which
would
have
been
impious
.
That
was
interesting
.
And
so
on
into
the
flare
and
glare
.
His
light
overcoat
blew
open
,
he
stepped
with
indescribable
idiosyncrasy
,
lent
a
little
forward
,
tripped
,
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
eyes
still
a
little
hawklike
;
he
tripped
through
London
,
towards
Westminster
,
observing
.
Was
everybody
dining
out
,
then
?
Doors
were
being
opened
here
by
a
footman
to
let
issue
a
high-stepping
old
dame
,
in
buckled
shoes
,
with
three
purple
ostrich
feathers
in
her
hair
.
Doors
were
being
opened
for
ladies
wrapped
like
mummies
in
shawls
with
bright
flowers
on
them
,
ladies
with
bare
heads
.
And
in
respectable
quarters
with
stucco
pillars
through
small
front
gardens
lightly
swathed
with
combs
in
their
hair
(
having
run
up
to
see
the
children
)
,
women
came
;
men
waited
for
them
,
with
their
coats
blowing
open
,
and
the
motor
started
.
Everybody
was
going
out
.
What
with
these
doors
being
opened
,
and
the
descent
and
the
start
,
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
of
London
were
embarking
in
little
boats
moored
to
the
bank
,
tossing
on
the
waters
,
as
if
the
whole
place
were
floating
off
in
carnival
.
And
Whitehall
was
skated
over
,
silver
beaten
as
it
was
,
skated
over
by
spiders
,
and
there
was
a
sense
of
midges
round
the
arc
lamps
;
it
was
so
hot
that
people
stood
about
talking
.
And
here
in
Westminster
was
a
retired
Judge
,
presumably
,
sitting
four
square
at
his
house
door
dressed
all
in
white
.
An
Anglo-Indian
presumably
.
And
here
a
shindy
of
brawling
women
,
drunken
women
;
here
only
a
policeman
and
looming
houses
,
high
houses
,
domed
houses
,
churches
,
parliaments
,
and
the
hoot
of
a
steamer
on
the
river
,
a
hollow
misty
cry
.
But
it
was
her
street
,
this
,
Clarissa
's
;
cabs
were
rushing
round
the
corner
,
like
water
round
the
piers
of
a
bridge
,
drawn
together
,
it
seemed
to
him
because
they
bore
people
going
to
her
party
,
Clarissa
's
party
.
The
cold
stream
of
visual
impressions
failed
him
now
as
if
the
eye
were
a
cup
that
overflowed
and
let
the
rest
run
down
its
china
walls
unrecorded
.
The
brain
must
wake
now
.
The
body
must
contract
now
,
entering
the
house
,
the
lighted
house
,
where
the
door
stood
open
,
where
the
motor
cars
were
standing
,
and
bright
women
descending
:
the
soul
must
brave
itself
to
endure
.
He
opened
the
big
blade
of
his
pocket-knife
.
Lucy
came
running
full
tilt
downstairs
,
having
just
nipped
in
to
the
drawing-room
to
smooth
a
cover
,
to
straighten
a
chair
,
to
pause
a
moment
and
feel
whoever
came
in
must
think
how
clean
,
how
bright
,
how
beautifully
cared
for
,
when
they
saw
the
beautiful
silver
,
the
brass
fire-irons
,
the
new
chair-covers
,
and
the
curtains
of
yellow
chintz
:
she
appraised
each
;
heard
a
roar
of
voices
;
people
already
coming
up
from
dinner
;
she
must
fly
!
The
Prime
Minister
was
coming
,
Agnes
said
:
so
she
had
heard
them
say
in
the
dining-room
,
she
said
,
coming
in
with
a
tray
of
glasses
.
Did
it
matter
,
did
it
matter
in
the
least
,
one
Prime
Minister
more
or
less
?
It
made
no
difference
at
this
hour
of
the
night
to
Mrs.
Walker
among
the
plates
,
saucepans
,
cullenders
,
frying-pans
,
chicken
in
aspic
,
ice-cream
freezers
,
pared
crusts
of
bread
,
lemons
,
soup
tureens
,
and
pudding
basins
which
,
however
hard
they
washed
up
in
the
scullery
seemed
to
be
all
on
top
of
her
,
on
the
kitchen
table
,
on
chairs
,
while
the
fire
blared
and
roared
,
the
electric
lights
glared
,
and
still
supper
had
to
be
laid
.
All
she
felt
was
,
one
Prime
Minister
more
or
less
made
not
a
scrap
of
difference
to
Mrs.
Walker
.
The
ladies
were
going
upstairs
already
,
said
Lucy
;
the
ladies
were
going
up
,
one
by
one
,
Mrs.
Dalloway
walking
last
and
almost
always
sending
back
some
message
to
the
kitchen
,
``
My
love
to
Mrs.
Walker
,
''
that
was
it
one
night
.
Next
morning
they
would
go
over
the
dishes
--
the
soup
,
the
salmon
;
the
salmon
,
Mrs.
Walker
knew
,
as
usual
underdone
,
for
she
always
got
nervous
about
the
pudding
and
left
it
to
Jenny
;
so
it
happened
,
the
salmon
was
always
underdone
.
But
some
lady
with
fair
hair
and
silver
ornaments
had
said
,
Lucy
said
,
about
the
entrée
,
was
it
really
made
at
home
?
But
it
was
the
salmon
that
bothered
Mrs.
Walker
,
as
she
spun
the
plates
round
and
round
,
and
pulled
in
dampers
and
pulled
out
dampers
;
and
there
came
a
burst
of
laughter
from
the
dining-room
;
a
voice
speaking
;
then
another
burst
of
laughter
--
the
gentlemen
enjoying
themselves
when
the
ladies
had
gone
.
The
tokay
,
said
Lucy
running
in
.
Mr.
Dalloway
had
sent
for
the
tokay
,
from
the
Emperor
's
cellars
,
the
Imperial
Tokay
.
It
was
borne
through
the
kitchen
.
Over
her
shoulder
Lucy
reported
how
Miss
Elizabeth
looked
quite
lovely
;
she
could
n't
take
her
eyes
off
her
;
in
her
pink
dress
,
wearing
the
necklace
Mr.
Dalloway
had
given
her
.
Jenny
must
remember
the
dog
,
Miss
Elizabeth
's
fox-terrier
,
which
,
since
it
bit
,
had
to
be
shut
up
and
might
,
Elizabeth
thought
,
want
something
.
Jenny
must
remember
the
dog
.
But
Jenny
was
not
going
upstairs
with
all
those
people
about
.
There
was
a
motor
at
the
door
already
!
There
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
--
and
the
gentlemen
still
in
the
dining-room
,
drinking
tokay
!
There
,
they
were
going
upstairs
;
that
was
the
first
to
come
,
and
now
they
would
come
faster
and
faster
,
so
that
Mrs.
Parkinson
(
hired
for
parties
)
would
leave
the
hall
door
ajar
,
and
the
hall
would
be
full
of
gentlemen
waiting
(
they
stood
waiting
,
sleeking
down
their
hair
)
while
the
ladies
took
their
cloaks
off
in
the
room
along
the
passage
;
where
Mrs.
Barnet
helped
them
,
old
Ellen
Barnet
,
who
had
been
with
the
family
for
forty
years
,
and
came
every
summer
to
help
the
ladies
,
and
remembered
mothers
when
they
were
girls
,
and
though
very
unassuming
did
shake
hands
;
said
``
milady
''
very
respectfully
,
yet
had
a
humorous
way
with
her
,
looking
at
the
young
ladies
,
and
ever
so
tactfully
helping
Lady
Lovejoy
,
who
had
some
trouble
with
her
underbodice
.
And
they
could
not
help
feeling
,
Lady
Lovejoy
and
Miss
Alice
,
that
some
little
privilege
in
the
matter
of
brush
and
comb
,
was
awarded
them
having
known
Mrs.
Barnet
--
''
thirty
years
,
milady
,
''
Mrs.
Barnet
supplied
her
.
Young
ladies
did
not
use
to
rouge
,
said
Lady
Lovejoy
,
when
they
stayed
at
Bourton
in
the
old
days
.
And
Miss
Alice
did
n't
need
rouge
,
said
Mrs.
Barnet
,
looking
at
her
fondly
.
There
Mrs.
Barnet
would
sit
,
in
the
cloakroom
,
patting
down
the
furs
,
smoothing
out
the
Spanish
shawls
,
tidying
the
dressing-table
,
and
knowing
perfectly
well
,
in
spite
of
the
furs
and
the
embroideries
,
which
were
nice
ladies
,
which
were
not
.
The
dear
old
body
,
said
Lady
Lovejoy
,
mounting
the
stairs
,
Clarissa
's
old
nurse
.
And
then
Lady
Lovejoy
stiffened
.
``
Lady
and
Miss
Lovejoy
,
''
she
said
to
Mr.
Wilkins
(
hired
for
parties
)
.
He
had
an
admirable
manner
,
as
he
bent
and
straightened
himself
,
bent
and
straightened
himself
and
announced
with
perfect
impartiality
``
Lady
and
Miss
Lovejoy
.
.
.
Sir
John
and
Lady
Needham
.
.
.
Miss
Weld
.
.
.
Mr
.
Walsh
.
''
His
manner
was
admirable
;
his
family
life
must
be
irreproachable
,
except
that
it
seemed
impossible
that
a
being
with
greenish
lips
and
shaven
cheeks
could
ever
have
blundered
into
the
nuisance
of
children
.
``
How
delightful
to
see
you
!
''
said
Clarissa
.
She
said
it
to
every
one
.
How
delightful
to
see
you
!
She
was
at
her
worst
--
effusive
,
insincere
.
It
was
a
great
mistake
to
have
come
.
He
should
have
stayed
at
home
and
read
his
book
,
thought
Peter
Walsh
;
should
have
gone
to
a
music
hall
;
he
should
have
stayed
at
home
,
for
he
knew
no
one
.
Oh
dear
,
it
was
going
to
be
a
failure
;
a
complete
failure
,
Clarissa
felt
it
in
her
bones
as
dear
old
Lord
Lexham
stood
there
apologising
for
his
wife
who
had
caught
cold
at
the
Buckingham
Palace
garden
party
.
She
could
see
Peter
out
of
the
tail
of
her
eye
,
criticising
her
,
there
,
in
that
corner
.
Why
,
after
all
,
did
she
do
these
things
?
Why
seek
pinnacles
and
stand
drenched
in
fire
?
Might
it
consume
her
anyhow
!
Burn
her
to
cinders
!
Better
anything
,
better
brandish
one
's
torch
and
hurl
it
to
earth
than
taper
and
dwindle
away
like
some
Ellie
Henderson
!
It
was
extraordinary
how
Peter
put
her
into
these
states
just
by
coming
and
standing
in
a
corner
.
He
made
her
see
herself
;
exaggerate
.
It
was
idiotic
.
But
why
did
he
come
,
then
,
merely
to
criticise
?
Why
always
take
,
never
give
?
Why
not
risk
one
's
one
little
point
of
view
?
There
he
was
wandering
off
,
and
she
must
speak
to
him
.
But
she
would
not
get
the
chance
.
Life
was
that
--
humiliation
,
renunciation
.
What
Lord
Lexham
was
saying
was
that
his
wife
would
not
wear
her
furs
at
the
garden
party
because
``
my
dear
,
you
ladies
are
all
alike
''
--
Lady
Lexham
being
seventy-five
at
least
!
It
was
delicious
,
how
they
petted
each
other
,
that
old
couple
.
She
did
like
old
Lord
Lexham
.
She
did
think
it
mattered
,
her
party
,
and
it
made
her
feel
quite
sick
to
know
that
it
was
all
going
wrong
,
all
falling
flat
.
Anything
,
any
explosion
,
any
horror
was
better
than
people
wandering
aimlessly
,
standing
in
a
bunch
at
a
corner
like
Ellie
Henderson
,
not
even
caring
to
hold
themselves
upright
.
Gently
the
yellow
curtain
with
all
the
birds
of
Paradise
blew
out
and
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
a
flight
of
wings
into
the
room
,
right
out
,
then
sucked
back
.
(
For
the
windows
were
open
.
)
Was
it
draughty
,
Ellie
Henderson
wondered
?
She
was
subject
to
chills
.
But
it
did
not
matter
that
she
should
come
down
sneezing
to-morrow
;
it
was
the
girls
with
their
naked
shoulders
she
thought
of
,
being
trained
to
think
of
others
by
an
old
father
,
an
invalid
,
late
vicar
of
Bourton
,
but
he
was
dead
now
;
and
her
chills
never
went
to
her
chest
,
never
.
It
was
the
girls
she
thought
of
,
the
young
girls
with
their
bare
shoulders
,
she
herself
having
always
been
a
wisp
of
a
creature
,
with
her
thin
hair
and
meagre
profile
;
though
now
,
past
fifty
,
there
was
beginning
to
shine
through
some
mild
beam
,
something
purified
into
distinction
by
years
of
self-abnegation
but
obscured
again
,
perpetually
,
by
her
distressing
gentility
,
her
panic
fear
,
which
arose
from
three
hundred
pounds
'
income
,
and
her
weaponless
state
(
she
could
not
earn
a
penny
)
and
it
made
her
timid
,
and
more
and
more
disqualified
year
by
year
to
meet
well-dressed
people
who
did
this
sort
of
thing
every
night
of
the
season
,
merely
telling
their
maids
``
I
'll
wear
so
and
so
,
''
whereas
Ellie
Henderson
ran
out
nervously
and
bought
cheap
pink
flowers
,
half
a
dozen
,
and
then
threw
a
shawl
over
her
old
black
dress
.
For
her
invitation
to
Clarissa
's
party
had
come
at
the
last
moment
.
She
was
not
quite
happy
about
it
.
She
had
a
sort
of
feeling
that
Clarissa
had
not
meant
to
ask
her
this
year
.
Why
should
she
?
There
was
no
reason
really
,
except
that
they
had
always
known
each
other
.
Indeed
,
they
were
cousins
.
But
naturally
they
had
rather
drifted
apart
,
Clarissa
being
so
sought
after
.
It
was
an
event
to
her
,
going
to
a
party
.
It
was
quite
a
treat
just
to
see
the
lovely
clothes
.
Was
n't
that
Elizabeth
,
grown
up
,
with
her
hair
done
in
the
fashionable
way
,
in
the
pink
dress
?
Yet
she
could
not
be
more
than
seventeen
.
She
was
very
,
very
handsome
.
But
girls
when
they
first
came
out
did
n't
seem
to
wear
white
as
they
used
.
(
She
must
remember
everything
to
tell
Edith
.
)
Girls
wore
straight
frocks
,
perfectly
tight
,
with
skirts
well
above
the
ankles
.
It
was
not
becoming
,
she
thought
.
So
,
with
her
weak
eyesight
,
Ellie
Henderson
craned
rather
forward
,
and
it
was
n't
so
much
she
who
minded
not
having
any
one
to
talk
to
(
she
hardly
knew
anybody
there
)
,
for
she
felt
that
they
were
all
such
interesting
people
to
watch
;
politicians
presumably
;
Richard
Dalloway
's
friends
;
but
it
was
Richard
himself
who
felt
that
he
could
not
let
the
poor
creature
go
on
standing
there
all
the
evening
by
herself
.
``
Well
,
Ellie
,
and
how
's
the
world
treating
you
?
''
he
said
in
his
genial
way
,
and
Ellie
Henderson
,
getting
nervous
and
flushing
and
feeling
that
it
was
extraordinarily
nice
of
him
to
come
and
talk
to
her
,
said
that
many
people
really
felt
the
heat
more
than
the
cold
.
``
Yes
,
they
do
,
''
said
Richard
Dalloway
.
``
Yes
.
''
But
what
more
did
one
say
?
``
Hullo
,
Richard
,
''
said
somebody
,
taking
him
by
the
elbow
,
and
,
good
Lord
,
there
was
old
Peter
,
old
Peter
Walsh
.
He
was
delighted
to
see
him
--
ever
so
pleased
to
see
him
!
He
had
n't
changed
a
bit
.
And
off
they
went
together
walking
right
across
the
room
,
giving
each
other
little
pats
,
as
if
they
had
n't
met
for
a
long
time
,
Ellie
Henderson
thought
,
watching
them
go
,
certain
she
knew
that
man
's
face
.
A
tall
man
,
middle
aged
,
rather
fine
eyes
,
dark
,
wearing
spectacles
,
with
a
look
of
John
Burrows
.
Edith
would
be
sure
to
know
.
The
curtain
with
its
flight
of
birds
of
Paradise
blew
out
again
.
And
Clarissa
saw
--
she
saw
Ralph
Lyon
beat
it
back
,
and
go
on
talking
.
So
it
was
n't
a
failure
after
all
!
it
was
going
to
be
all
right
now
--
her
party
.
It
had
begun
.
It
had
started
.
But
it
was
still
touch
and
go
.
She
must
stand
there
for
the
present
.
People
seemed
to
come
in
a
rush
.
Colonel
and
Mrs.
Garrod
.
.
.
Mr.
Hugh
Whitbread
.
.
.
Mr.
Bowley
.
.
.
Mrs.
Hilbery
.
.
.
Lady
Mary
Maddox
.
.
.
Mr.
Quin
.
.
.
intoned
Wilkin
.
She
had
six
or
seven
words
with
each
,
and
they
went
on
,
they
went
into
the
rooms
;
into
something
now
,
not
nothing
,
since
Ralph
Lyon
had
beat
back
the
curtain
.
And
yet
for
her
own
part
,
it
was
too
much
of
an
effort
.
She
was
not
enjoying
it
.
It
was
too
much
like
being
--
just
anybody
,
standing
there
;
anybody
could
do
it
;
yet
this
anybody
she
did
a
little
admire
,
could
n't
help
feeling
that
she
had
,
anyhow
,
made
this
happen
,
that
it
marked
a
stage
,
this
post
that
she
felt
herself
to
have
become
,
for
oddly
enough
she
had
quite
forgotten
what
she
looked
like
,
but
felt
herself
a
stake
driven
in
at
the
top
of
her
stairs
.
Every
time
she
gave
a
party
she
had
this
feeling
of
being
something
not
herself
,
and
that
every
one
was
unreal
in
one
way
;
much
more
real
in
another
.
It
was
,
she
thought
,
partly
their
clothes
,
partly
being
taken
out
of
their
ordinary
ways
,
partly
the
background
,
it
was
possible
to
say
things
you
could
n't
say
anyhow
else
,
things
that
needed
an
effort
;
possible
to
go
much
deeper
.
But
not
for
her
;
not
yet
anyhow
.
``
How
delightful
to
see
you
!
''
she
said
.
Dear
old
Sir
Harry
!
He
would
know
every
one
.
And
what
was
so
odd
about
it
was
the
sense
one
had
as
they
came
up
the
stairs
one
after
another
,
Mrs.
Mount
and
Celia
,
Herbert
Ainsty
,
Mrs.
Dakers
--
oh
and
Lady
Bruton
!
``
How
awfully
good
of
you
to
come
!
''
she
said
,
and
she
meant
it
--
it
was
odd
how
standing
there
one
felt
them
going
on
,
going
on
,
some
quite
old
,
some
.
.
.
What
name
?
Lady
Rosseter
?
But
who
on
earth
was
Lady
Rosseter
?
``
Clarissa
!
''
That
voice
!
It
was
Sally
Seton
!
Sally
Seton
!
after
all
these
years
!
She
loomed
through
a
mist
.
For
she
had
n't
looked
like
that
,
Sally
Seton
,
when
Clarissa
grasped
the
hot
water
can
,
to
think
of
her
under
this
roof
,
under
this
roof
!
Not
like
that
!
All
on
top
of
each
other
,
embarrassed
,
laughing
,
words
tumbled
out
--
passing
through
London
;
heard
from
Clara
Haydon
;
what
a
chance
of
seeing
you
!
So
I
thrust
myself
in
--
without
an
invitation
.
.
.
.
One
might
put
down
the
hot
water
can
quite
composedly
.
The
lustre
had
gone
out
of
her
.
Yet
it
was
extraordinary
to
see
her
again
,
older
,
happier
,
less
lovely
.
They
kissed
each
other
,
first
this
cheek
then
that
,
by
the
drawing-room
door
,
and
Clarissa
turned
,
with
Sally
's
hand
in
hers
,
and
saw
her
rooms
full
,
heard
the
roar
of
voices
,
saw
the
candlesticks
,
the
blowing
curtains
,
and
the
roses
which
Richard
had
given
her
.
``
I
have
five
enormous
boys
,
''
said
Sally
.
She
had
the
simplest
egotism
,
the
most
open
desire
to
be
thought
first
always
,
and
Clarissa
loved
her
for
being
still
like
that
.
``
I
ca
n't
believe
it
!
''
she
cried
,
kindling
all
over
with
pleasure
at
the
thought
of
the
past
.
But
alas
,
Wilkins
;
Wilkins
wanted
her
;
Wilkins
was
emitting
in
a
voice
of
commanding
authority
as
if
the
whole
company
must
be
admonished
and
the
hostess
reclaimed
from
frivolity
,
one
name
:
``
The
Prime
Minister
,
''
said
Peter
Walsh
.
The
Prime
Minister
?
Was
it
really
?
Ellie
Henderson
marvelled
.
What
a
thing
to
tell
Edith
!
One
could
n't
laugh
at
him
.
He
looked
so
ordinary
.
You
might
have
stood
him
behind
a
counter
and
bought
biscuits
--
poor
chap
,
all
rigged
up
in
gold
lace
.
And
to
be
fair
,
as
he
went
his
rounds
,
first
with
Clarissa
then
with
Richard
escorting
him
,
he
did
it
very
well
.
He
tried
to
look
somebody
.
It
was
amusing
to
watch
.
Nobody
looked
at
him
.
They
just
went
on
talking
,
yet
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
they
all
knew
,
felt
to
the
marrow
of
their
bones
,
this
majesty
passing
;
this
symbol
of
what
they
all
stood
for
,
English
society
.
Old
Lady
Bruton
,
and
she
looked
very
fine
too
,
very
stalwart
in
her
lace
,
swam
up
,
and
they
withdrew
into
a
little
room
which
at
once
became
spied
upon
,
guarded
,
and
a
sort
of
stir
and
rustle
rippled
through
every
one
,
openly
:
the
Prime
Minister
!
Lord
,
lord
,
the
snobbery
of
the
English
!
thought
Peter
Walsh
,
standing
in
the
corner
.
How
they
loved
dressing
up
in
gold
lace
and
doing
homage
!
There
!
That
must
be
,
by
Jove
it
was
,
Hugh
Whitbread
,
snuffing
round
the
precincts
of
the
great
,
grown
rather
fatter
,
rather
whiter
,
the
admirable
Hugh
!
He
looked
always
as
if
he
were
on
duty
,
thought
Peter
,
a
privileged
,
but
secretive
being
,
hoarding
secrets
which
he
would
die
to
defend
,
though
it
was
only
some
little
piece
of
tittle-tattle
dropped
by
a
court
footman
,
which
would
be
in
all
the
papers
tomorrow
.
Such
were
his
rattles
,
his
baubles
,
in
playing
with
which
he
had
grown
white
,
come
to
the
verge
of
old
age
,
enjoying
the
respect
and
affection
of
all
who
had
the
privilege
of
knowing
this
type
of
the
English
public
school
man
.
Inevitably
one
made
up
things
like
that
about
Hugh
;
that
was
his
style
;
the
style
of
those
admirable
letters
which
Peter
had
read
thousands
of
miles
across
the
sea
in
the
Times
,
and
had
thanked
God
he
was
out
of
that
pernicious
hubble-bubble
if
it
were
only
to
hear
baboons
chatter
and
coolies
beat
their
wives
.
An
olive-skinned
youth
from
one
of
the
Universities
stood
obsequiously
by
.
Him
he
would
patronise
,
initiate
,
teach
how
to
get
on
.
For
he
liked
nothing
better
than
doing
kindnesses
,
making
the
hearts
of
old
ladies
palpitate
with
the
joy
of
being
thought
of
in
their
age
,
their
affliction
,
thinking
themselves
quite
forgotten
,
yet
here
was
dear
Hugh
driving
up
and
spending
an
hour
talking
of
the
past
,
remembering
trifles
,
praising
the
home-made
cake
,
though
Hugh
might
eat
cake
with
a
Duchess
any
day
of
his
life
,
and
,
to
look
at
him
,
probably
did
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
in
that
agreeable
occupation
.
The
All-judging
,
the
All-merciful
,
might
excuse
.
Peter
Walsh
had
no
mercy
.
Villains
there
must
be
,
and
God
knows
the
rascals
who
get
hanged
for
battering
the
brains
of
a
girl
out
in
a
train
do
less
harm
on
the
whole
than
Hugh
Whitbread
and
his
kindness
.
Look
at
him
now
,
on
tiptoe
,
dancing
forward
,
bowing
and
scraping
,
as
the
Prime
Minister
and
Lady
Bruton
emerged
,
intimating
for
all
the
world
to
see
that
he
was
privileged
to
say
something
,
something
private
,
to
Lady
Bruton
as
she
passed
.
She
stopped
.
She
wagged
her
fine
old
head
.
She
was
thanking
him
presumably
for
some
piece
of
servility
.
She
had
her
toadies
,
minor
officials
in
Government
offices
who
ran
about
putting
through
little
jobs
on
her
behalf
,
in
return
for
which
she
gave
them
luncheon
.
But
she
derived
from
the
eighteenth
century
.
She
was
all
right
.
And
now
Clarissa
escorted
her
Prime
Minister
down
the
room
,
prancing
,
sparkling
,
with
the
stateliness
of
her
grey
hair
.
She
wore
ear-rings
,
and
a
silver-green
mermaid
's
dress
.
Lolloping
on
the
waves
and
braiding
her
tresses
she
seemed
,
having
that
gift
still
;
to
be
;
to
exist
;
to
sum
it
all
up
in
the
moment
as
she
passed
;
turned
,
caught
her
scarf
in
some
other
woman
's
dress
,
unhitched
it
,
laughed
,
all
with
the
most
perfect
ease
and
air
of
a
creature
floating
in
its
element
.
But
age
had
brushed
her
;
even
as
a
mermaid
might
behold
in
her
glass
the
setting
sun
on
some
very
clear
evening
over
the
waves
.
There
was
a
breath
of
tenderness
;
her
severity
,
her
prudery
,
her
woodenness
were
all
warmed
through
now
,
and
she
had
about
her
as
she
said
good-bye
to
the
thick
gold-laced
man
who
was
doing
his
best
,
and
good
luck
to
him
,
to
look
important
,
an
inexpressible
dignity
;
an
exquisite
cordiality
;
as
if
she
wished
the
whole
world
well
,
and
must
now
,
being
on
the
very
verge
and
rim
of
things
,
take
her
leave
.
So
she
made
him
think
.
(
But
he
was
not
in
love
.
)
Indeed
,
Clarissa
felt
,
the
Prime
Minister
had
been
good
to
come
.
And
,
walking
down
the
room
with
him
,
with
Sally
there
and
Peter
there
and
Richard
very
pleased
,
with
all
those
people
rather
inclined
,
perhaps
,
to
envy
,
she
had
felt
that
intoxication
of
the
moment
,
that
dilatation
of
the
nerves
of
the
heart
itself
till
it
seemed
to
quiver
,
steeped
,
upright
;
--
yes
,
but
after
all
it
was
what
other
people
felt
,
that
;
for
,
though
she
loved
it
and
felt
it
tingle
and
sting
,
still
these
semblances
,
these
triumphs
(
dear
old
Peter
,
for
example
,
thinking
her
so
brilliant
)
,
had
a
hollowness
;
at
arm
's
length
they
were
,
not
in
the
heart
;
and
it
might
be
that
she
was
growing
old
but
they
satisfied
her
no
longer
as
they
used
;
and
suddenly
,
as
she
saw
the
Prime
Minister
go
down
the
stairs
,
the
gilt
rim
of
the
Sir
Joshua
picture
of
the
little
girl
with
a
muff
brought
back
Kilman
with
a
rush
;
Kilman
her
enemy
.
That
was
satisfying
;
that
was
real
.
Ah
,
how
she
hated
her
--
hot
,
hypocritical
,
corrupt
;
with
all
that
power
;
Elizabeth
's
seducer
;
the
woman
who
had
crept
in
to
steal
and
defile
(
Richard
would
say
,
What
nonsense
!
)
.
She
hated
her
:
she
loved
her
.
It
was
enemies
one
wanted
,
not
friends
--
not
Mrs.
Durrant
and
Clara
,
Sir
William
and
Lady
Bradshaw
,
Miss
Truelock
and
Eleanor
Gibson
(
whom
she
saw
coming
upstairs
)
.
They
must
find
her
if
they
wanted
her
.
She
was
for
the
party
!
There
was
her
old
friend
Sir
Harry
.
``
Dear
Sir
Harry
!
''
she
said
,
going
up
to
the
fine
old
fellow
who
had
produced
more
bad
pictures
than
any
other
two
Academicians
in
the
whole
of
St.
John
's
Wood
(
they
were
always
of
cattle
,
standing
in
sunset
pools
absorbing
moisture
,
or
signifying
,
for
he
had
a
certain
range
of
gesture
,
by
the
raising
of
one
foreleg
and
the
toss
of
the
antlers
,
``
the
Approach
of
the
Stranger
''
--
all
his
activities
,
dining
out
,
racing
,
were
founded
on
cattle
standing
absorbing
moisture
in
sunset
pools
)
.
``
What
are
you
laughing
at
?
''
she
asked
him
.
For
Willie
Titcomb
and
Sir
Harry
and
Herbert
Ainsty
were
all
laughing
.
But
no
.
Sir
Harry
could
not
tell
Clarissa
Dalloway
(
much
though
he
liked
her
;
of
her
type
he
thought
her
perfect
,
and
threatened
to
paint
her
)
his
stories
of
the
music
hall
stage
.
He
chaffed
her
about
her
party
.
He
missed
his
brandy
.
These
circles
,
he
said
,
were
above
him
.
But
he
liked
her
;
respected
her
,
in
spite
of
her
damnable
,
difficult
upper-class
refinement
,
which
made
it
impossible
to
ask
Clarissa
Dalloway
to
sit
on
his
knee
.
And
up
came
that
wandering
will-o'-the-wisp
,
that
vagulous
phosphorescence
,
old
Mrs.
Hilbery
,
stretching
her
hands
to
the
blaze
of
his
laughter
(
about
the
Duke
and
the
Lady
)
,
which
,
as
she
heard
it
across
the
room
,
seemed
to
reassure
her
on
a
point
which
sometimes
bothered
her
if
she
woke
early
in
the
morning
and
did
not
like
to
call
her
maid
for
a
cup
of
tea
;
how
it
is
certain
we
must
die
.
``
They
wo
n't
tell
us
their
stories
,
''
said
Clarissa
.
``
Dear
Clarissa
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Hilbery
.
She
looked
to-night
,
she
said
,
so
like
her
mother
as
she
first
saw
her
walking
in
a
garden
in
a
grey
hat
.
And
really
Clarissa
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
Her
mother
,
walking
in
a
garden
!
But
alas
,
she
must
go
.
For
there
was
Professor
Brierly
,
who
lectured
on
Milton
,
talking
to
little
Jim
Hutton
(
who
was
unable
even
for
a
party
like
this
to
compass
both
tie
and
waistcoat
or
make
his
hair
lie
flat
)
,
and
even
at
this
distance
they
were
quarrelling
,
she
could
see
.
For
Professor
Brierly
was
a
very
queer
fish
.
With
all
those
degrees
,
honours
,
lectureships
between
him
and
the
scribblers
he
suspected
instantly
an
atmosphere
not
favourable
to
his
queer
compound
;
his
prodigious
learning
and
timidity
;
his
wintry
charm
without
cordiality
;
his
innocence
blent
with
snobbery
;
he
quivered
if
made
conscious
by
a
lady
's
unkempt
hair
,
a
youth
's
boots
,
of
an
underworld
,
very
creditable
doubtless
,
of
rebels
,
of
ardent
young
people
;
of
would-be
geniuses
,
and
intimated
with
a
little
toss
of
the
head
,
with
a
sniff
--
Humph
!
--
the
value
of
moderation
;
of
some
slight
training
in
the
classics
in
order
to
appreciate
Milton
.
Professor
Brierly
(
Clarissa
could
see
)
was
n't
hitting
it
off
with
little
Jim
Hutton
(
who
wore
red
socks
,
his
black
being
at
the
laundry
)
about
Milton
.
She
interrupted
.
She
said
she
loved
Bach
.
So
did
Hutton
.
That
was
the
bond
between
them
,
and
Hutton
(
a
very
bad
poet
)
always
felt
that
Mrs.
Dalloway
was
far
the
best
of
the
great
ladies
who
took
an
interest
in
art
.
It
was
odd
how
strict
she
was
.
About
music
she
was
purely
impersonal
.
She
was
rather
a
prig
.
But
how
charming
to
look
at
!
She
made
her
house
so
nice
if
it
were
n't
for
her
Professors
.
Clarissa
had
half
a
mind
to
snatch
him
off
and
set
him
down
at
the
piano
in
the
back
room
.
For
he
played
divinely
.
``
But
the
noise
!
''
she
said
.
``
The
noise
!
''
``
The
sign
of
a
successful
party
.
''
Nodding
urbanely
,
the
Professor
stepped
delicately
off
.
``
He
knows
everything
in
the
whole
world
about
Milton
,
''
said
Clarissa
.
``
Does
he
indeed
?
''
said
Hutton
,
who
would
imitate
the
Professor
throughout
Hampstead
;
the
Professor
on
Milton
;
the
Professor
on
moderation
;
the
Professor
stepping
delicately
off
.
But
she
must
speak
to
that
couple
,
said
Clarissa
,
Lord
Gayton
and
Nancy
Blow
.
Not
that
they
added
perceptibly
to
the
noise
of
the
party
.
They
were
not
talking
(
perceptibly
)
as
they
stood
side
by
side
by
the
yellow
curtains
.
They
would
soon
be
off
elsewhere
,
together
;
and
never
had
very
much
to
say
in
any
circumstances
.
They
looked
;
that
was
all
.
That
was
enough
.
They
looked
so
clean
,
so
sound
,
she
with
an
apricot
bloom
of
powder
and
paint
,
but
he
scrubbed
,
rinsed
,
with
the
eyes
of
a
bird
,
so
that
no
ball
could
pass
him
or
stroke
surprise
him
.
He
struck
,
he
leapt
,
accurately
,
on
the
spot
.
Ponies
'
mouths
quivered
at
the
end
of
his
reins
.
He
had
his
honours
,
ancestral
monuments
,
banners
hanging
in
the
church
at
home
.
He
had
his
duties
;
his
tenants
;
a
mother
and
sisters
;
had
been
all
day
at
Lords
,
and
that
was
what
they
were
talking
about
--
cricket
,
cousins
,
the
movies
--
when
Mrs.
Dalloway
came
up
.
Lord
Gayton
liked
her
most
awfully
.
So
did
Miss
Blow
.
She
had
such
charming
manners
.
``
It
is
angelic
--
it
is
delicious
of
you
to
have
come
!
''
she
said
.
She
loved
Lords
;
she
loved
youth
,
and
Nancy
,
dressed
at
enormous
expense
by
the
greatest
artists
in
Paris
,
stood
there
looking
as
if
her
body
had
merely
put
forth
,
of
its
own
accord
,
a
green
frill
.
``
I
had
meant
to
have
dancing
,
''
said
Clarissa
.
For
the
young
people
could
not
talk
.
And
why
should
they
?
Shout
,
embrace
,
swing
,
be
up
at
dawn
;
carry
sugar
to
ponies
;
kiss
and
caress
the
snouts
of
adorable
chows
;
and
then
all
tingling
and
streaming
,
plunge
and
swim
.
But
the
enormous
resources
of
the
English
language
,
the
power
it
bestows
,
after
all
,
of
communicating
feelings
(
at
their
age
,
she
and
Peter
would
have
been
arguing
all
the
evening
)
,
was
not
for
them
.
They
would
solidify
young
.
They
would
be
good
beyond
measure
to
the
people
on
the
estate
,
but
alone
,
perhaps
,
rather
dull
.
``
What
a
pity
!
''
she
said
.
``
I
had
hoped
to
have
dancing
.
''
It
was
so
extraordinarily
nice
of
them
to
have
come
!
But
talk
of
dancing
!
The
rooms
were
packed
.
There
was
old
Aunt
Helena
in
her
shawl
.
Alas
,
she
must
leave
them
--
Lord
Gayton
and
Nancy
Blow
.
There
was
old
Miss
Parry
,
her
aunt
.
For
Miss
Helena
Parry
was
not
dead
:
Miss
Parry
was
alive
.
She
was
past
eighty
.
She
ascended
staircases
slowly
with
a
stick
.
She
was
placed
in
a
chair
(
Richard
had
seen
to
it
)
.
People
who
had
known
Burma
in
the
'seventies
were
always
led
up
to
her
.
Where
had
Peter
got
to
?
They
used
to
be
such
friends
.
For
at
the
mention
of
India
,
or
even
Ceylon
,
her
eyes
(
only
one
was
glass
)
slowly
deepened
,
became
blue
,
beheld
,
not
human
beings
--
she
had
no
tender
memories
,
no
proud
illusions
about
Viceroys
,
Generals
,
Mutinies
--
it
was
orchids
she
saw
,
and
mountain
passes
and
herself
carried
on
the
backs
of
coolies
in
the
'sixties
over
solitary
peaks
;
or
descending
to
uproot
orchids
(
startling
blossoms
,
never
beheld
before
)
which
she
painted
in
water-colour
;
an
indomitable
Englishwoman
,
fretful
if
disturbed
by
the
War
,
say
,
which
dropped
a
bomb
at
her
very
door
,
from
her
deep
meditation
over
orchids
and
her
own
figure
journeying
in
the
'sixties
in
India
--
but
here
was
Peter
.
``
Come
and
talk
to
Aunt
Helena
about
Burma
,
''
said
Clarissa
.
And
yet
he
had
not
had
a
word
with
her
all
the
evening
!
``
We
will
talk
later
,
''
said
Clarissa
,
leading
him
up
to
Aunt
Helena
,
in
her
white
shawl
,
with
her
stick
.
``
Peter
Walsh
,
''
said
Clarissa
.
That
meant
nothing
.
Clarissa
had
asked
her
.
It
was
tiring
;
it
was
noisy
;
but
Clarissa
had
asked
her
.
So
she
had
come
.
It
was
a
pity
that
they
lived
in
London
--
Richard
and
Clarissa
.
If
only
for
Clarissa
's
health
it
would
have
been
better
to
live
in
the
country
.
But
Clarissa
had
always
been
fond
of
society
.
``
He
has
been
in
Burma
,
''
said
Clarissa
.
Ah
.
She
could
not
resist
recalling
what
Charles
Darwin
had
said
about
her
little
book
on
the
orchids
of
Burma
.
(
Clarissa
must
speak
to
Lady
Bruton
.
)
No
doubt
it
was
forgotten
now
,
her
book
on
the
orchids
of
Burma
,
but
it
went
into
three
editions
before
1870
,
she
told
Peter
.
She
remembered
him
now
.
He
had
been
at
Bourton
(
and
he
had
left
her
,
Peter
Walsh
remembered
,
without
a
word
in
the
drawing-room
that
night
when
Clarissa
had
asked
him
to
come
boating
)
.
``
Richard
so
much
enjoyed
his
lunch
party
,
''
said
Clarissa
to
Lady
Bruton
.
``
Richard
was
the
greatest
possible
help
,
''
Lady
Bruton
replied
.
``
He
helped
me
to
write
a
letter
.
And
how
are
you
?
''
``
Oh
,
perfectly
well
!
''
said
Clarissa
.
(
Lady
Bruton
detested
illness
in
the
wives
of
politicians
.
)
``
And
there
's
Peter
Walsh
!
''
said
Lady
Bruton
(
for
she
could
never
think
of
anything
to
say
to
Clarissa
;
though
she
liked
her
.
She
had
lots
of
fine
qualities
;
but
they
had
nothing
in
common
--
she
and
Clarissa
.
It
might
have
been
better
if
Richard
had
married
a
woman
with
less
charm
,
who
would
have
helped
him
more
in
his
work
.
He
had
lost
his
chance
of
the
Cabinet
)
.
``
There
's
Peter
Walsh
!
''
she
said
,
shaking
hands
with
that
agreeable
sinner
,
that
very
able
fellow
who
should
have
made
a
name
for
himself
but
had
n't
(
always
in
difficulties
with
women
)
,
and
,
of
course
,
old
Miss
Parry
.
Wonderful
old
lady
!
Lady
Bruton
stood
by
Miss
Parry
's
chair
,
a
spectral
grenadier
,
draped
in
black
,
inviting
Peter
Walsh
to
lunch
;
cordial
;
but
without
small
talk
,
remembering
nothing
whatever
about
the
flora
or
fauna
of
India
.
She
had
been
there
,
of
course
;
had
stayed
with
three
Viceroys
;
thought
some
of
the
Indian
civilians
uncommonly
fine
fellows
;
but
what
a
tragedy
it
was
--
the
state
of
India
!
The
Prime
Minister
had
just
been
telling
her
(
old
Miss
Parry
huddled
up
in
her
shawl
,
did
not
care
what
the
Prime
Minister
had
just
been
telling
her
)
,
and
Lady
Bruton
would
like
to
have
Peter
Walsh
's
opinion
,
he
being
fresh
from
the
centre
,
and
she
would
get
Sir
Sampson
to
meet
him
,
for
really
it
prevented
her
from
sleeping
at
night
,
the
folly
of
it
,
the
wickedness
she
might
say
,
being
a
soldier
's
daughter
.
She
was
an
old
woman
now
,
not
good
for
much
.
But
her
house
,
her
servants
,
her
good
friend
Milly
Brush
--
did
he
remember
her
?
--
were
all
there
only
asking
to
be
used
if
--
if
they
could
be
of
help
,
in
short
.
For
she
never
spoke
of
England
,
but
this
isle
of
men
,
this
dear
,
dear
land
,
was
in
her
blood
(
without
reading
Shakespeare
)
,
and
if
ever
a
woman
could
have
worn
the
helmet
and
shot
the
arrow
,
could
have
led
troops
to
attack
,
ruled
with
indomitable
justice
barbarian
hordes
and
lain
under
a
shield
noseless
in
a
church
,
or
made
a
green
grass
mound
on
some
primeval
hillside
,
that
woman
was
Millicent
Bruton
.
Debarred
by
her
sex
and
some
truancy
,
too
,
of
the
logical
faculty
(
she
found
it
impossible
to
write
a
letter
to
the
Times
)
,
she
had
the
thought
of
Empire
always
at
hand
,
and
had
acquired
from
her
association
with
that
armoured
goddess
her
ramrod
bearing
,
her
robustness
of
demeanour
,
so
that
one
could
not
figure
her
even
in
death
parted
from
the
earth
or
roaming
territories
over
which
,
in
some
spiritual
shape
,
the
Union
Jack
had
ceased
to
fly
.
To
be
not
English
even
among
the
dead
--
no
,
no
!
Impossible
!
But
was
it
Lady
Bruton
(
whom
she
used
to
know
)
?
Was
it
Peter
Walsh
grown
grey
?
Lady
Rosseter
asked
herself
(
who
had
been
Sally
Seton
)
.
It
was
old
Miss
Parry
certainly
--
the
old
aunt
who
used
to
be
so
cross
when
she
stayed
at
Bourton
.
Never
should
she
forget
running
along
the
passage
naked
,
and
being
sent
for
by
Miss
Parry
!
And
Clarissa
!
oh
Clarissa
!
Sally
caught
her
by
the
arm
.
Clarissa
stopped
beside
them
.
``
But
I
ca
n't
stay
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
shall
come
later
.
Wait
,
''
she
said
,
looking
at
Peter
and
Sally
.
They
must
wait
,
she
meant
,
until
all
these
people
had
gone
.
``
I
shall
come
back
,
''
she
said
,
looking
at
her
old
friends
,
Sally
and
Peter
,
who
were
shaking
hands
,
and
Sally
,
remembering
the
past
no
doubt
,
was
laughing
.
But
her
voice
was
wrung
of
its
old
ravishing
richness
;
her
eyes
not
aglow
as
they
used
to
be
,
when
she
smoked
cigars
,
when
she
ran
down
the
passage
to
fetch
her
sponge
bag
,
without
a
stitch
of
clothing
on
her
,
and
Ellen
Atkins
asked
,
What
if
the
gentlemen
had
met
her
?
But
everybody
forgave
her
.
She
stole
a
chicken
from
the
larder
because
she
was
hungry
in
the
night
;
she
smoked
cigars
in
her
bedroom
;
she
left
a
priceless
book
in
the
punt
.
But
everybody
adored
her
(
except
perhaps
Papa
)
.
It
was
her
warmth
;
her
vitality
--
she
would
paint
,
she
would
write
.
Old
women
in
the
village
never
to
this
day
forgot
to
ask
after
``
your
friend
in
the
red
cloak
who
seemed
so
bright
.
''
She
accused
Hugh
Whitbread
,
of
all
people
(
and
there
he
was
,
her
old
friend
Hugh
,
talking
to
the
Portuguese
Ambassador
)
,
of
kissing
her
in
the
smoking-room
to
punish
her
for
saying
that
women
should
have
votes
.
Vulgar
men
did
,
she
said
.
And
Clarissa
remembered
having
to
persuade
her
not
to
denounce
him
at
family
prayers
--
which
she
was
capable
of
doing
with
her
daring
,
her
recklessness
,
her
melodramatic
love
of
being
the
centre
of
everything
and
creating
scenes
,
and
it
was
bound
,
Clarissa
used
to
think
,
to
end
in
some
awful
tragedy
;
her
death
;
her
martyrdom
;
instead
of
which
she
had
married
,
quite
unexpectedly
,
a
bald
man
with
a
large
buttonhole
who
owned
,
it
was
said
,
cotton
mills
at
Manchester
.
And
she
had
five
boys
!
She
and
Peter
had
settled
down
together
.
They
were
talking
:
it
seemed
so
familiar
--
that
they
should
be
talking
.
They
would
discuss
the
past
.
With
the
two
of
them
(
more
even
than
with
Richard
)
she
shared
her
past
;
the
garden
;
the
trees
;
old
Joseph
Breitkopf
singing
Brahms
without
any
voice
;
the
drawing-room
wallpaper
;
the
smell
of
the
mats
.
A
part
of
this
Sally
must
always
be
;
Peter
must
always
be
.
But
she
must
leave
them
.
There
were
the
Bradshaws
,
whom
she
disliked
.
She
must
go
up
to
Lady
Bradshaw
(
in
grey
and
silver
,
balancing
like
a
sea-lion
at
the
edge
of
its
tank
,
barking
for
invitations
,
Duchesses
,
the
typical
successful
man
's
wife
)
,
she
must
go
up
to
Lady
Bradshaw
and
say
.
.
.
But
Lady
Bradshaw
anticipated
her
.
``
We
are
shockingly
late
,
dear
Mrs.
Dalloway
,
we
hardly
dared
to
come
in
,
''
she
said
.
And
Sir
William
,
who
looked
very
distinguished
,
with
his
grey
hair
and
blue
eyes
,
said
yes
;
they
had
not
been
able
to
resist
the
temptation
.
He
was
talking
to
Richard
about
that
Bill
probably
,
which
they
wanted
to
get
through
the
Commons
.
Why
did
the
sight
of
him
,
talking
to
Richard
,
curl
her
up
?
He
looked
what
he
was
,
a
great
doctor
.
A
man
absolutely
at
the
head
of
his
profession
,
very
powerful
,
rather
worn
.
For
think
what
cases
came
before
him
--
people
in
the
uttermost
depths
of
misery
;
people
on
the
verge
of
insanity
;
husbands
and
wives
.
He
had
to
decide
questions
of
appalling
difficulty
.
Yet
--
what
she
felt
was
,
one
would
n't
like
Sir
William
to
see
one
unhappy
.
No
;
not
that
man
.
``
How
is
your
son
at
Eton
?
''
she
asked
Lady
Bradshaw
.
He
had
just
missed
his
eleven
,
said
Lady
Bradshaw
,
because
of
the
mumps
.
His
father
minded
even
more
than
he
did
,
she
thought
``
being
,
''
she
said
,
``
nothing
but
a
great
boy
himself
.
''
Clarissa
looked
at
Sir
William
,
talking
to
Richard
.
He
did
not
look
like
a
boy
--
not
in
the
least
like
a
boy
.
She
had
once
gone
with
some
one
to
ask
his
advice
.
He
had
been
perfectly
right
;
extremely
sensible
.
But
Heavens
--
what
a
relief
to
get
out
to
the
street
again
!
There
was
some
poor
wretch
sobbing
,
she
remembered
,
in
the
waiting-room
.
But
she
did
not
know
what
it
was
--
about
Sir
William
;
what
exactly
she
disliked
.
Only
Richard
agreed
with
her
,
``
did
n't
like
his
taste
,
did
n't
like
his
smell
.
''
But
he
was
extraordinarily
able
.
They
were
talking
about
this
Bill
.
Some
case
,
Sir
William
was
mentioning
,
lowering
his
voice
.
It
had
its
bearing
upon
what
he
was
saying
about
the
deferred
effects
of
shell
shock
.
There
must
be
some
provision
in
the
Bill
.
Sinking
her
voice
,
drawing
Mrs.
Dalloway
into
the
shelter
of
a
common
femininity
,
a
common
pride
in
the
illustrious
qualities
of
husbands
and
their
sad
tendency
to
overwork
,
Lady
Bradshaw
(
poor
goose
--
one
did
n't
dislike
her
)
murmured
how
,
``
just
as
we
were
starting
,
my
husband
was
called
up
on
the
telephone
,
a
very
sad
case
.
A
young
man
(
that
is
what
Sir
William
is
telling
Mr.
Dalloway
)
had
killed
himself
.
He
had
been
in
the
army
.
''
Oh
!
thought
Clarissa
,
in
the
middle
of
my
party
,
here
's
death
,
she
thought
.
She
went
on
,
into
the
little
room
where
the
Prime
Minister
had
gone
with
Lady
Bruton
.
Perhaps
there
was
somebody
there
.
But
there
was
nobody
.
The
chairs
still
kept
the
impress
of
the
Prime
Minister
and
Lady
Bruton
,
she
turned
deferentially
,
he
sitting
four-square
,
authoritatively
.
They
had
been
talking
about
India
.
There
was
nobody
.
The
party
's
splendour
fell
to
the
floor
,
so
strange
it
was
to
come
in
alone
in
her
finery
.
What
business
had
the
Bradshaws
to
talk
of
death
at
her
party
?
A
young
man
had
killed
himself
.
And
they
talked
of
it
at
her
party
--
the
Bradshaws
,
talked
of
death
.
He
had
killed
himself
--
but
how
?
Always
her
body
went
through
it
first
,
when
she
was
told
,
suddenly
,
of
an
accident
;
her
dress
flamed
,
her
body
burnt
.
He
had
thrown
himself
from
a
window
.
Up
had
flashed
the
ground
;
through
him
,
blundering
,
bruising
,
went
the
rusty
spikes
.
There
he
lay
with
a
thud
,
thud
,
thud
in
his
brain
,
and
then
a
suffocation
of
blackness
.
So
she
saw
it
.
But
why
had
he
done
it
?
And
the
Bradshaws
talked
of
it
at
her
party
!
She
had
once
thrown
a
shilling
into
the
Serpentine
,
never
anything
more
.
But
he
had
flung
it
away
.
They
went
on
living
(
she
would
have
to
go
back
;
the
rooms
were
still
crowded
;
people
kept
on
coming
)
.
They
(
all
day
she
had
been
thinking
of
Bourton
,
of
Peter
,
of
Sally
)
,
they
would
grow
old
.
A
thing
there
was
that
mattered
;
a
thing
,
wreathed
about
with
chatter
,
defaced
,
obscured
in
her
own
life
,
let
drop
every
day
in
corruption
,
lies
,
chatter
.
This
he
had
preserved
.
Death
was
defiance
.
Death
was
an
attempt
to
communicate
;
people
feeling
the
impossibility
of
reaching
the
centre
which
,
mystically
,
evaded
them
;
closeness
drew
apart
;
rapture
faded
,
one
was
alone
.
There
was
an
embrace
in
death
.
But
this
young
man
who
had
killed
himself
--
had
he
plunged
holding
his
treasure
?
``
If
it
were
now
to
die
,
'twere
now
to
be
most
happy
,
''
she
had
said
to
herself
once
,
coming
down
in
white
.
Or
there
were
the
poets
and
thinkers
.
Suppose
he
had
had
that
passion
,
and
had
gone
to
Sir
William
Bradshaw
,
a
great
doctor
yet
to
her
obscurely
evil
,
without
sex
or
lust
,
extremely
polite
to
women
,
but
capable
of
some
indescribable
outrage
--
forcing
your
soul
,
that
was
it
--
if
this
young
man
had
gone
to
him
,
and
Sir
William
had
impressed
him
,
like
that
,
with
his
power
,
might
he
not
then
have
said
(
indeed
she
felt
it
now
)
,
Life
is
made
intolerable
;
they
make
life
intolerable
,
men
like
that
?
Then
(
she
had
felt
it
only
this
morning
)
there
was
the
terror
;
the
overwhelming
incapacity
,
one
's
parents
giving
it
into
one
's
hands
,
this
life
,
to
be
lived
to
the
end
,
to
be
walked
with
serenely
;
there
was
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
an
awful
fear
.
Even
now
,
quite
often
if
Richard
had
not
been
there
reading
the
Times
,
so
that
she
could
crouch
like
a
bird
and
gradually
revive
,
send
roaring
up
that
immeasurable
delight
,
rubbing
stick
to
stick
,
one
thing
with
another
,
she
must
have
perished
.
But
that
young
man
had
killed
himself
.
Somehow
it
was
her
disaster
--
her
disgrace
.
It
was
her
punishment
to
see
sink
and
disappear
here
a
man
,
there
a
woman
,
in
this
profound
darkness
,
and
she
forced
to
stand
here
in
her
evening
dress
.
She
had
schemed
;
she
had
pilfered
.
She
was
never
wholly
admirable
.
She
had
wanted
success
.
Lady
Bexborough
and
the
rest
of
it
.
And
once
she
had
walked
on
the
terrace
at
Bourton
.
It
was
due
to
Richard
;
she
had
never
been
so
happy
.
Nothing
could
be
slow
enough
;
nothing
last
too
long
.
No
pleasure
could
equal
,
she
thought
,
straightening
the
chairs
,
pushing
in
one
book
on
the
shelf
,
this
having
done
with
the
triumphs
of
youth
,
lost
herself
in
the
process
of
living
,
to
find
it
,
with
a
shock
of
delight
,
as
the
sun
rose
,
as
the
day
sank
.
Many
a
time
had
she
gone
,
at
Bourton
when
they
were
all
talking
,
to
look
at
the
sky
;
or
seen
it
between
people
's
shoulders
at
dinner
;
seen
it
in
London
when
she
could
not
sleep
.
She
walked
to
the
window
.
It
held
,
foolish
as
the
idea
was
,
something
of
her
own
in
it
,
this
country
sky
,
this
sky
above
Westminster
.
She
parted
the
curtains
;
she
looked
.
Oh
,
but
how
surprising
!
--
in
the
room
opposite
the
old
lady
stared
straight
at
her
!
She
was
going
to
bed
.
And
the
sky
.
It
will
be
a
solemn
sky
,
she
had
thought
,
it
will
be
a
dusky
sky
,
turning
away
its
cheek
in
beauty
.
But
there
it
was
--
ashen
pale
,
raced
over
quickly
by
tapering
vast
clouds
.
It
was
new
to
her
.
The
wind
must
have
risen
.
She
was
going
to
bed
,
in
the
room
opposite
.
It
was
fascinating
to
watch
her
,
moving
about
,
that
old
lady
,
crossing
the
room
,
coming
to
the
window
.
Could
she
see
her
?
It
was
fascinating
,
with
people
still
laughing
and
shouting
in
the
drawing-room
,
to
watch
that
old
woman
,
quite
quietly
,
going
to
bed
.
She
pulled
the
blind
now
.
The
clock
began
striking
.
The
young
man
had
killed
himself
;
but
she
did
not
pity
him
;
with
the
clock
striking
the
hour
,
one
,
two
,
three
,
she
did
not
pity
him
,
with
all
this
going
on
.
There
!
the
old
lady
had
put
out
her
light
!
the
whole
house
was
dark
now
with
this
going
on
,
she
repeated
,
and
the
words
came
to
her
,
Fear
no
more
the
heat
of
the
sun
.
She
must
go
back
to
them
.
But
what
an
extraordinary
night
!
She
felt
somehow
very
like
him
--
the
young
man
who
had
killed
himself
.
She
felt
glad
that
he
had
done
it
;
thrown
it
away
.
The
clock
was
striking
.
The
leaden
circles
dissolved
in
the
air
.
He
made
her
feel
the
beauty
;
made
her
feel
the
fun
.
But
she
must
go
back
.
She
must
assemble
.
She
must
find
Sally
and
Peter
.
And
she
came
in
from
the
little
room
.
``
But
where
is
Clarissa
?
''
said
Peter
.
He
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
with
Sally
.
(
After
all
these
years
he
really
could
not
call
her
``
Lady
Rosseter
.
''
)
``
Where
's
the
woman
gone
to
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Where
's
Clarissa
?
''
Sally
supposed
,
and
so
did
Peter
for
the
matter
of
that
,
that
there
were
people
of
importance
,
politicians
,
whom
neither
of
them
knew
unless
by
sight
in
the
picture
papers
,
whom
Clarissa
had
to
be
nice
to
,
had
to
talk
to
.
She
was
with
them
.
Yet
there
was
Richard
Dalloway
not
in
the
Cabinet
.
He
had
n't
been
a
success
,
Sally
supposed
?
For
herself
,
she
scarcely
ever
read
the
papers
.
She
sometimes
saw
his
name
mentioned
.
But
then
--
well
,
she
lived
a
very
solitary
life
,
in
the
wilds
,
Clarissa
would
say
,
among
great
merchants
,
great
manufacturers
,
men
,
after
all
,
who
did
things
.
She
had
done
things
too
!
``
I
have
five
sons
!
''
she
told
him
.
Lord
,
Lord
,
what
a
change
had
come
over
her
!
the
softness
of
motherhood
;
its
egotism
too
.
Last
time
they
met
,
Peter
remembered
,
had
been
among
the
cauliflowers
in
the
moonlight
,
the
leaves
``
like
rough
bronze
''
she
had
said
,
with
her
literary
turn
;
and
she
had
picked
a
rose
.
She
had
marched
him
up
and
down
that
awful
night
,
after
the
scene
by
the
fountain
;
he
was
to
catch
the
midnight
train
.
Heavens
,
he
had
wept
!
That
was
his
old
trick
,
opening
a
pocket-knife
,
thought
Sally
,
always
opening
and
shutting
a
knife
when
he
got
excited
.
They
had
been
very
,
very
intimate
,
she
and
Peter
Walsh
,
when
he
was
in
love
with
Clarissa
,
and
there
was
that
dreadful
,
ridiculous
scene
over
Richard
Dalloway
at
lunch
.
She
had
called
Richard
``
Wickham
.
''
Why
not
call
Richard
``
Wickham
''
?
Clarissa
had
flared
up
!
and
indeed
they
had
never
seen
each
other
since
,
she
and
Clarissa
,
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
times
perhaps
in
the
last
ten
years
.
And
Peter
Walsh
had
gone
off
to
India
,
and
she
had
heard
vaguely
that
he
had
made
an
unhappy
marriage
,
and
she
did
n't
know
whether
he
had
any
children
,
and
she
could
n't
ask
him
,
for
he
had
changed
.
He
was
rather
shrivelled-looking
,
but
kinder
,
she
felt
,
and
she
had
a
real
affection
for
him
,
for
he
was
connected
with
her
youth
,
and
she
still
had
a
little
Emily
Brontë
he
had
given
her
,
and
he
was
to
write
,
surely
?
In
those
days
he
was
to
write
.
``
Have
you
written
?
''
she
asked
him
,
spreading
her
hand
,
her
firm
and
shapely
hand
,
on
her
knee
in
a
way
he
recalled
.
``
Not
a
word
!
''
said
Peter
Walsh
,
and
she
laughed
.
She
was
still
attractive
,
still
a
personage
,
Sally
Seton
.
But
who
was
this
Rosseter
?
He
wore
two
camellias
on
his
wedding
day
--
that
was
all
Peter
knew
of
him
.
``
They
have
myriads
of
servants
,
miles
of
conservatories
,
''
Clarissa
wrote
;
something
like
that
.
Sally
owned
it
with
a
shout
of
laughter
.
``
Yes
,
I
have
ten
thousand
a
year
''
--
whether
before
the
tax
was
paid
or
after
,
she
could
n't
remember
,
for
her
husband
,
``
whom
you
must
meet
,
''
she
said
,
``
whom
you
would
like
,
''
she
said
,
did
all
that
for
her
.
And
Sally
used
to
be
in
rags
and
tatters
.
She
had
pawned
her
grandmother
's
ring
which
Marie
Antoinette
had
given
her
great-grandfather
to
come
to
Bourton
.
Oh
yes
,
Sally
remembered
;
she
had
it
still
,
a
ruby
ring
which
Marie
Antoinette
had
given
her
great-grandfather
.
She
never
had
a
penny
to
her
name
in
those
days
,
and
going
to
Bourton
always
meant
some
frightful
pinch
.
But
going
to
Bourton
had
meant
so
much
to
her
--
had
kept
her
sane
,
she
believed
,
so
unhappy
had
she
been
at
home
.
But
that
was
all
a
thing
of
the
past
--
all
over
now
,
she
said
.
And
Mr.
Parry
was
dead
;
and
Miss
Parry
was
still
alive
.
Never
had
he
had
such
a
shock
in
his
life
!
said
Peter
.
He
had
been
quite
certain
she
was
dead
.
And
the
marriage
had
been
,
Sally
supposed
,
a
success
?
And
that
very
handsome
,
very
self-possessed
young
woman
was
Elizabeth
,
over
there
,
by
the
curtains
,
in
red
.
(
She
was
like
a
poplar
,
she
was
like
a
river
,
she
was
like
a
hyacinth
,
Willie
Titcomb
was
thinking
.
Oh
how
much
nicer
to
be
in
the
country
and
do
what
she
liked
!
She
could
hear
her
poor
dog
howling
,
Elizabeth
was
certain
.
)
She
was
not
a
bit
like
Clarissa
,
Peter
Walsh
said
.
``
Oh
,
Clarissa
!
''
said
Sally
.
What
Sally
felt
was
simply
this
.
She
had
owed
Clarissa
an
enormous
amount
.
They
had
been
friends
,
not
acquaintances
,
friends
,
and
she
still
saw
Clarissa
all
in
white
going
about
the
house
with
her
hands
full
of
flowers
--
to
this
day
tobacco
plants
made
her
think
of
Bourton
.
But
--
did
Peter
understand
?
--
she
lacked
something
.
Lacked
what
was
it
?
She
had
charm
;
she
had
extraordinary
charm
.
But
to
be
frank
(
and
she
felt
that
Peter
was
an
old
friend
,
a
real
friend
--
did
absence
matter
?
did
distance
matter
?
She
had
often
wanted
to
write
to
him
,
but
torn
it
up
,
yet
felt
he
understood
,
for
people
understand
without
things
being
said
,
as
one
realises
growing
old
,
and
old
she
was
,
had
been
that
afternoon
to
see
her
sons
at
Eton
,
where
they
had
the
mumps
)
,
to
be
quite
frank
then
,
how
could
Clarissa
have
done
it
?
--
married
Richard
Dalloway
?
a
sportsman
,
a
man
who
cared
only
for
dogs
.
Literally
,
when
he
came
into
the
room
he
smelt
of
the
stables
.
And
then
all
this
?
She
waved
her
hand
.
Hugh
Whitbread
it
was
,
strolling
past
in
his
white
waistcoat
,
dim
,
fat
,
blind
,
past
everything
he
looked
,
except
self-esteem
and
comfort
.
``
He
's
not
going
to
recognise
us
,
''
said
Sally
,
and
really
she
had
n't
the
courage
--
so
that
was
Hugh
!
the
admirable
Hugh
!
``
And
what
does
he
do
?
''
she
asked
Peter
.
He
blacked
the
King
's
boots
or
counted
bottles
at
Windsor
,
Peter
told
her
.
Peter
kept
his
sharp
tongue
still
!
But
Sally
must
be
frank
,
Peter
said
.
That
kiss
now
,
Hugh
's
.
On
the
lips
,
she
assured
him
,
in
the
smoking-room
one
evening
.
She
went
straight
to
Clarissa
in
a
rage
.
Hugh
did
n't
do
such
things
!
Clarissa
said
,
the
admirable
Hugh
!
Hugh
's
socks
were
without
exception
the
most
beautiful
she
had
ever
seen
--
and
now
his
evening
dress
.
Perfect
!
And
had
he
children
?
``
Everybody
in
the
room
has
six
sons
at
Eton
,
''
Peter
told
her
,
except
himself
.
He
,
thank
God
,
had
none
.
No
sons
,
no
daughters
,
no
wife
.
Well
,
he
did
n't
seem
to
mind
,
said
Sally
.
He
looked
younger
,
she
thought
,
than
any
of
them
.
But
it
had
been
a
silly
thing
to
do
,
in
many
ways
,
Peter
said
,
to
marry
like
that
;
``
a
perfect
goose
she
was
,
''
he
said
,
but
,
he
said
,
``
we
had
a
splendid
time
of
it
,
''
but
how
could
that
be
?
Sally
wondered
;
what
did
he
mean
?
and
how
odd
it
was
to
know
him
and
yet
not
know
a
single
thing
that
had
happened
to
him
.
And
did
he
say
it
out
of
pride
?
Very
likely
,
for
after
all
it
must
be
galling
for
him
(
though
he
was
an
oddity
,
a
sort
of
sprite
,
not
at
all
an
ordinary
man
)
,
it
must
be
lonely
at
his
age
to
have
no
home
,
nowhere
to
go
to
.
But
he
must
stay
with
them
for
weeks
and
weeks
.
Of
course
he
would
;
he
would
love
to
stay
with
them
,
and
that
was
how
it
came
out
.
All
these
years
the
Dalloways
had
never
been
once
.
Time
after
time
they
had
asked
them
.
Clarissa
(
for
it
was
Clarissa
of
course
)
would
not
come
.
For
,
said
Sally
,
Clarissa
was
at
heart
a
snob
--
one
had
to
admit
it
,
a
snob
.
And
it
was
that
that
was
between
them
,
she
was
convinced
.
Clarissa
thought
she
had
married
beneath
her
,
her
husband
being
--
she
was
proud
of
it
--
a
miner
's
son
.
Every
penny
they
had
he
had
earned
.
As
a
little
boy
(
her
voice
trembled
)
he
had
carried
great
sacks
.
(
And
so
she
would
go
on
,
Peter
felt
,
hour
after
hour
;
the
miner
's
son
;
people
thought
she
had
married
beneath
her
;
her
five
sons
;
and
what
was
the
other
thing
--
plants
,
hydrangeas
,
syringas
,
very
,
very
rare
hibiscus
lilies
that
never
grow
north
of
the
Suez
Canal
,
but
she
,
with
one
gardener
in
a
suburb
near
Manchester
,
had
beds
of
them
,
positively
beds
!
Now
all
that
Clarissa
had
escaped
,
unmaternal
as
she
was
.
)
A
snob
was
she
?
Yes
,
in
many
ways
.
Where
was
she
,
all
this
time
?
It
was
getting
late
.
``
Yet
,
''
said
Sally
,
``
when
I
heard
Clarissa
was
giving
a
party
,
I
felt
I
could
n't
not
come
--
must
see
her
again
(
and
I
'm
staying
in
Victoria
Street
,
practically
next
door
)
.
So
I
just
came
without
an
invitation
.
But
,
''
she
whispered
,
``
tell
me
,
do
.
Who
is
this
?
''
It
was
Mrs.
Hilbery
,
looking
for
the
door
.
For
how
late
it
was
getting
!
And
,
she
murmured
,
as
the
night
grew
later
,
as
people
went
,
one
found
old
friends
;
quiet
nooks
and
corners
;
and
the
loveliest
views
.
Did
they
know
,
she
asked
,
that
they
were
surrounded
by
an
enchanted
garden
?
Lights
and
trees
and
wonderful
gleaming
lakes
and
the
sky
.
Just
a
few
fairy
lamps
,
Clarissa
Dalloway
had
said
,
in
the
back
garden
!
But
she
was
a
magician
!
It
was
a
park
.
.
.
.
And
she
did
n't
know
their
names
,
but
friends
she
knew
they
were
,
friends
without
names
,
songs
without
words
,
always
the
best
.
But
there
were
so
many
doors
,
such
unexpected
places
,
she
could
not
find
her
way
.
``
Old
Mrs.
Hilbery
,
''
said
Peter
;
but
who
was
that
?
that
lady
standing
by
the
curtain
all
the
evening
,
without
speaking
?
He
knew
her
face
;
connected
her
with
Bourton
.
Surely
she
used
to
cut
up
underclothes
at
the
large
table
in
the
window
?
Davidson
,
was
that
her
name
?
``
Oh
,
that
is
Ellie
Henderson
,
''
said
Sally
.
Clarissa
was
really
very
hard
on
her
.
She
was
a
cousin
,
very
poor
.
Clarissa
was
hard
on
people
.
She
was
rather
,
said
Peter
.
Yet
,
said
Sally
,
in
her
emotional
way
,
with
a
rush
of
that
enthusiasm
which
Peter
used
to
love
her
for
,
yet
dreaded
a
little
now
,
so
effusive
she
might
become
--
how
generous
to
her
friends
Clarissa
was
!
and
what
a
rare
quality
one
found
it
,
and
how
sometimes
at
night
or
on
Christmas
Day
,
when
she
counted
up
her
blessings
,
she
put
that
friendship
first
.
They
were
young
;
that
was
it
.
Clarissa
was
pure-hearted
;
that
was
it
.
Peter
would
think
her
sentimental
.
So
she
was
.
For
she
had
come
to
feel
that
it
was
the
only
thing
worth
saying
--
what
one
felt
.
Cleverness
was
silly
.
One
must
say
simply
what
one
felt
.
``
But
I
do
not
know
,
''
said
Peter
Walsh
,
``
what
I
feel
.
''
Poor
Peter
,
thought
Sally
.
Why
did
not
Clarissa
come
and
talk
to
them
?
That
was
what
he
was
longing
for
.
She
knew
it
.
All
the
time
he
was
thinking
only
of
Clarissa
,
and
was
fidgeting
with
his
knife
.
He
had
not
found
life
simple
,
Peter
said
.
His
relations
with
Clarissa
had
not
been
simple
.
It
had
spoilt
his
life
,
he
said
.
(
They
had
been
so
intimate
--
he
and
Sally
Seton
,
it
was
absurd
not
to
say
it
.
)
One
could
not
be
in
love
twice
,
he
said
.
And
what
could
she
say
?
Still
,
it
is
better
to
have
loved
(
but
he
would
think
her
sentimental
--
he
used
to
be
so
sharp
)
.
He
must
come
and
stay
with
them
in
Manchester
.
That
is
all
very
true
,
he
said
.
All
very
true
.
He
would
love
to
come
and
stay
with
them
,
directly
he
had
done
what
he
had
to
do
in
London
.
And
Clarissa
had
cared
for
him
more
than
she
had
ever
cared
for
Richard
.
Sally
was
positive
of
that
.
``
No
,
no
,
no
!
''
said
Peter
(
Sally
should
not
have
said
that
--
she
went
too
far
)
.
That
good
fellow
--
there
he
was
at
the
end
of
the
room
,
holding
forth
,
the
same
as
ever
,
dear
old
Richard
.
Who
was
he
talking
to
?
Sally
asked
,
that
very
distinguished-looking
man
?
Living
in
the
wilds
as
she
did
,
she
had
an
insatiable
curiosity
to
know
who
people
were
.
But
Peter
did
not
know
.
He
did
not
like
his
looks
,
he
said
,
probably
a
Cabinet
Minister
.
Of
them
all
,
Richard
seemed
to
him
the
best
,
he
said
--
the
most
disinterested
.
``
But
what
has
he
done
?
''
Sally
asked
.
Public
work
,
she
supposed
.
And
were
they
happy
together
?
Sally
asked
(
she
herself
was
extremely
happy
)
;
for
,
she
admitted
,
she
knew
nothing
about
them
,
only
jumped
to
conclusions
,
as
one
does
,
for
what
can
one
know
even
of
the
people
one
lives
with
every
day
?
she
asked
.
Are
we
not
all
prisoners
?
She
had
read
a
wonderful
play
about
a
man
who
scratched
on
the
wall
of
his
cell
,
and
she
had
felt
that
was
true
of
life
--
one
scratched
on
the
wall
.
Despairing
of
human
relationships
(
people
were
so
difficult
)
,
she
often
went
into
her
garden
and
got
from
her
flowers
a
peace
which
men
and
women
never
gave
her
.
But
no
;
he
did
not
like
cabbages
;
he
preferred
human
beings
,
Peter
said
.
Indeed
,
the
young
are
beautiful
,
Sally
said
,
watching
Elizabeth
cross
the
room
.
How
unlike
Clarissa
at
her
age
!
Could
he
make
anything
of
her
?
She
would
not
open
her
lips
.
Not
much
,
not
yet
,
Peter
admitted
.
She
was
like
a
lily
,
Sally
said
,
a
lily
by
the
side
of
a
pool
.
But
Peter
did
not
agree
that
we
know
nothing
.
We
know
everything
,
he
said
;
at
least
he
did
.
But
these
two
,
Sally
whispered
,
these
two
coming
now
(
and
really
she
must
go
,
if
Clarissa
did
not
come
soon
)
,
this
distinguished-looking
man
and
his
rather
common-looking
wife
who
had
been
talking
to
Richard
--
what
could
one
know
about
people
like
that
?
``
That
they
're
damnable
humbugs
,
''
said
Peter
,
looking
at
them
casually
.
He
made
Sally
laugh
.
But
Sir
William
Bradshaw
stopped
at
the
door
to
look
at
a
picture
.
He
looked
in
the
corner
for
the
engraver
's
name
.
His
wife
looked
too
.
Sir
William
Bradshaw
was
so
interested
in
art
.
When
one
was
young
,
said
Peter
,
one
was
too
much
excited
to
know
people
.
Now
that
one
was
old
,
fifty-two
to
be
precise
(
Sally
was
fifty-five
,
in
body
,
she
said
,
but
her
heart
was
like
a
girl
's
of
twenty
)
;
now
that
one
was
mature
then
,
said
Peter
,
one
could
watch
,
one
could
understand
,
and
one
did
not
lose
the
power
of
feeling
,
he
said
.
No
,
that
is
true
,
said
Sally
.
She
felt
more
deeply
,
more
passionately
,
every
year
.
It
increased
,
he
said
,
alas
,
perhaps
,
but
one
should
be
glad
of
it
--
it
went
on
increasing
in
his
experience
.
There
was
some
one
in
India
.
He
would
like
to
tell
Sally
about
her
.
He
would
like
Sally
to
know
her
.
She
was
married
,
he
said
.
She
had
two
small
children
.
They
must
all
come
to
Manchester
,
said
Sally
--
he
must
promise
before
they
left
.
There
's
Elizabeth
,
he
said
,
she
feels
not
half
what
we
feel
,
not
yet
.
But
,
said
Sally
,
watching
Elizabeth
go
to
her
father
,
one
can
see
they
are
devoted
to
each
other
.
She
could
feel
it
by
the
way
Elizabeth
went
to
her
father
.
For
her
father
had
been
looking
at
her
,
as
he
stood
talking
to
the
Bradshaws
,
and
he
had
thought
to
himself
,
Who
is
that
lovely
girl
?
And
suddenly
he
realised
that
it
was
his
Elizabeth
,
and
he
had
not
recognised
her
,
she
looked
so
lovely
in
her
pink
frock
!
Elizabeth
had
felt
him
looking
at
her
as
she
talked
to
Willie
Titcomb
.
So
she
went
to
him
and
they
stood
together
,
now
that
the
party
was
almost
over
,
looking
at
the
people
going
,
and
the
rooms
getting
emptier
and
emptier
,
with
things
scattered
on
the
floor
.
Even
Ellie
Henderson
was
going
,
nearly
last
of
all
,
though
no
one
had
spoken
to
her
,
but
she
had
wanted
to
see
everything
,
to
tell
Edith
.
And
Richard
and
Elizabeth
were
rather
glad
it
was
over
,
but
Richard
was
proud
of
his
daughter
.
And
he
had
not
meant
to
tell
her
,
but
he
could
not
help
telling
her
.
He
had
looked
at
her
,
he
said
,
and
he
had
wondered
,
Who
is
that
lovely
girl
?
and
it
was
his
daughter
!
That
did
make
her
happy
.
But
her
poor
dog
was
howling
.
``
Richard
has
improved
.
You
are
right
,
''
said
Sally
.
``
I
shall
go
and
talk
to
him
.
I
shall
say
goodnight
.
What
does
the
brain
matter
,
''
said
Lady
Rosseter
,
getting
up
,
``
compared
with
the
heart
?
''
``
I
will
come
,
''
said
Peter
,
but
he
sat
on
for
a
moment
.
What
is
this
terror
?
what
is
this
ecstasy
?
he
thought
to
himself
.
What
is
it
that
fills
me
with
extraordinary
excitement
?
It
is
Clarissa
,
he
said
.
For
there
she
was
.
One
It
was
a
QUEER
,
sultry
summer
,
the
summer
they
electrocuted
the
Rosenbergs
,
and
I
did
n't
know
what
I
was
doing
in
New
York
.
I
'm
stupid
about
executions
.
The
idea
of
being
electrocuted
makes
me
sick
,
and
that
's
all
there
was
to
read
about
in
the
papers
--
goggle-eyed
headlines
staring
up
at
me
on
every
street
corner
and
at
the
fusty
,
peanut-
smelling
mouth
of
every
subway
.
It
had
nothing
to
do
with
me
,
but
I
could
n't
help
wondering
what
it
would
be
like
,
being
burned
alive
all
along
your
nerves
.
I
thought
it
must
be
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
.
New
York
was
bad
enough
.
By
nine
in
the
morning
the
fake
,
country-wet
freshness
that
somehow
seeped
in
overnight
evaporated
like
the
tail
end
of
a
sweet
dream
.
Mirage-gray
at
the
bottom
of
their
granite
canyons
,
the
hot
streets
wavered
in
the
sun
,
the
car
tops
sizzled
and
glittered
,
and
the
dry
,
cindery
dust
blew
into
my
eyes
and
down
my
throat
.
I
kept
hearing
about
the
Rosenbergs
over
the
radio
and
at
the
office
till
I
could
n't
get
them
out
of
my
mind
.
It
was
like
the
first
time
I
saw
a
cadaver
.
For
weeks
afterward
,
the
cadaver
's
head
--
or
what
there
was
left
of
it
--
floated
up
behind
my
eggs
and
bacon
at
breakfast
and
behind
the
face
of
Buddy
Willard
,
who
was
responsible
for
my
seeing
it
in
the
first
place
,
and
pretty
soon
I
felt
as
though
I
were
carrying
that
cadaver
's
head
around
with
me
on
a
string
,
like
some
black
,
noseless
balloon
stinking
of
vinegar
.
I
knew
something
was
wrong
with
me
that
summer
,
because
all
I
could
think
about
was
the
Rosenbergs
and
how
stupid
I
'd
been
to
buy
all
those
uncomfortable
,
expensive
clothes
,
hanging
limp
as
fish
in
my
closet
,
and
how
all
the
little
successes
I
'd
totted
up
so
happily
at
college
fizzled
to
nothing
outside
the
slick
marble
and
plate-glass
fronts
along
Madison
Avenue
.
I
was
supposed
to
be
having
the
time
of
my
life
.
I
was
supposed
to
be
the
envy
of
thousands
of
other
college
girls
just
like
me
all
over
America
who
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
be
tripping
about
in
those
same
size-
seven
patent
leather
shoes
I
'd
bought
in
Bloomingdale
's
one
lunch
hour
with
a
black
patent
leather
belt
and
black
patent
leather
pocketbook
to
match
.
And
when
my
picture
came
out
in
the
magazine
the
twelve
of
us
were
working
on
--
drinking
martinis
in
a
skimpy
,
imitation
silver-lamé
bodice
stuck
on
to
a
big
,
fat
cloud
of
white
tulle
,
on
some
Starlight
Roof
,
in
the
company
of
several
anonymous
young
men
with
all-American
bone
structures
hired
or
loaned
for
the
occasion
--
everybody
would
think
I
must
be
having
a
real
whirl
.
Look
what
can
happen
in
this
country
,
they
'd
say
.
A
girl
lives
in
some
out-of-the-
way
town
for
nineteen
years
,
so
poor
she
ca
n't
afford
a
magazine
,
and
then
she
gets
a
scholarship
to
college
and
wins
a
prize
here
and
a
prize
there
and
ends
up
steering
New
York
like
her
own
private
car
.
Only
I
was
n't
steering
anything
,
not
even
myself
.
I
just
bumped
from
my
hotel
to
work
and
to
parties
and
from
parties
to
my
hotel
and
back
to
work
like
a
numb
trolleybus
.
I
guess
I
should
have
been
excited
the
way
most
of
the
other
girls
were
,
but
I
could
n't
get
myself
to
react
.
I
felt
very
still
and
very
empty
,
the
way
the
eye
of
a
tornado
must
feel
,
moving
dully
along
in
the
middle
of
the
surrounding
hullabaloo
.
There
were
twelve
of
us
at
the
hotel
.
We
had
all
won
a
fashion
magazine
contest
,
by
writing
essays
and
stories
and
poems
and
fashion
blurbs
,
and
as
prizes
they
gave
us
jobs
in
New
York
for
a
month
,
expenses
paid
,
and
piles
and
piles
of
free
bonuses
,
like
ballet
tickets
and
passes
to
fashion
shows
and
hair
stylings
at
a
famous
expensive
salon
and
chances
to
meet
successful
people
in
the
field
of
our
desire
and
advice
about
what
to
do
with
our
particular
complexions
.
I
still
have
the
make-up
kit
they
gave
me
,
fitted
out
for
a
person
with
brown
eyes
and
brown
hair
:
an
oblong
of
brown
mascara
with
a
tiny
brush
,
and
a
round
basin
of
blue
eyeshadow
just
big
enough
to
dab
the
tip
of
your
finger
in
,
and
three
lipsticks
ranging
from
red
to
pink
,
all
cased
in
the
same
little
gilt
box
with
a
mirror
on
one
side
.
I
also
have
a
white
plastic
sunglasses
case
with
colored
shells
and
sequins
and
a
green
plastic
starfish
sewed
onto
it
.
I
realized
we
kept
piling
up
these
presents
because
it
was
as
good
as
free
advertising
for
the
firms
involved
,
but
I
could
n't
be
cynical
.
I
got
such
a
kick
out
of
all
those
free
gifts
showering
on
to
us
.
For
a
long
time
afterward
I
hid
them
away
,
but
later
,
when
I
was
all
right
again
,
I
brought
them
out
,
and
I
still
have
them
around
the
house
.
I
use
the
lipsticks
now
and
then
,
and
last
week
I
cut
the
plastic
starfish
off
the
sunglasses
case
for
the
baby
to
play
with
.
So
there
were
twelve
of
us
at
the
hotel
,
in
the
same
wing
on
the
same
floor
in
single
rooms
,
one
after
the
other
,
and
it
reminded
me
of
my
dormitory
at
college
.
It
was
n't
a
proper
hotel
--
I
mean
a
hotel
where
there
are
both
men
and
women
mixed
about
here
and
there
on
the
same
floor
.
This
hotel
--
the
Amazon
--
was
for
women
only
,
and
they
were
mostly
girls
my
age
with
wealthy
parents
who
wanted
to
be
sure
their
daughters
would
be
living
where
men
could
n't
get
at
them
and
deceive
them
;
and
they
were
all
going
to
posh
secretarial
schools
like
Katy
Gibbs
,
where
they
had
to
wear
hats
and
stockings
and
gloves
to
class
,
or
they
had
just
graduated
from
places
like
Katy
Gibbs
and
were
secretaries
to
executives
and
simply
hanging
around
in
New
York
waiting
to
get
married
to
some
career
man
or
other
.
These
girls
looked
awfully
bored
to
me
.
I
saw
them
on
the
sunroof
,
yawning
and
painting
their
nails
and
trying
to
keep
up
their
Bermuda
tans
,
and
they
seemed
bored
as
hell
.
I
talked
with
one
of
them
,
and
she
was
bored
with
yachts
and
bored
with
flying
around
in
airplanes
and
bored
with
skiing
in
Switzerland
at
Christmas
and
bored
with
the
men
in
Brazil
.
Girls
like
that
make
me
sick
.
I
'm
so
jealous
I
ca
n't
speak
.
Nineteen
years
,
and
I
had
n't
been
out
of
New
England
except
for
this
trip
to
New
York
.
It
was
my
first
big
chance
,
but
here
I
was
,
sitting
back
and
letting
it
run
through
my
fingers
like
so
much
water
.
I
guess
one
of
my
troubles
was
Doreen
.
I
'd
never
known
a
girl
like
Doreen
before
.
Doreen
came
from
a
society
girls
'
college
down
South
and
had
bright
white
hair
standing
out
in
a
cotton
candy
fluff
round
her
head
and
blue
eyes
like
transparent
agate
marbles
,
hard
and
polished
and
just
about
indestructible
,
and
a
mouth
set
in
a
sort
of
perpetual
sneer
.
I
do
n't
mean
a
nasty
sneer
,
but
an
amused
,
mysterious
sneer
,
as
if
all
the
people
around
her
were
pretty
silly
and
she
could
tell
some
good
jokes
on
them
if
she
wanted
to
.
Doreen
singled
me
out
right
away
.
She
made
me
feel
I
was
that
much
sharper
than
the
others
,
and
she
really
was
wonderfully
funny
.
She
used
to
sit
next
to
me
at
the
conference
table
,
and
when
the
visiting
celebrities
were
talking
she
'd
whisper
witty
sarcastic
remarks
to
me
under
her
breath
.
Her
college
was
so
fashion
conscious
,
she
said
,
that
all
the
girls
had
pocketbook
covers
made
out
of
the
same
material
as
their
dresses
,
so
each
time
they
changed
their
clothes
they
had
a
matching
pocketbook
.
This
kind
of
detail
impressed
me
.
It
suggested
a
whole
life
of
marvelous
,
elaborate
decadence
that
attracted
me
like
a
magnet
.
The
only
thing
Doreen
ever
bawled
me
out
about
was
bothering
to
get
my
assignments
in
by
a
deadline
.
``
What
are
you
sweating
over
that
for
?
''
Doreen
lounged
on
my
bed
in
a
peach
silk
dressing
gown
,
filing
her
long
,
nicotine-yellow
nails
with
an
emery
board
,
while
I
typed
up
the
draft
of
an
interview
with
a
best-selling
novelist
.
That
was
another
thing
--
the
rest
of
us
had
starched
cotton
summer
nighties
and
quilted
housecoats
,
or
maybe
terrycloth
robes
that
doubled
as
beachcoats
,
but
Doreen
wore
these
full-length
nylon
and
lace
jobs
you
could
half
see
through
,
and
dressing
gowns
the
color
of
skin
,
that
stuck
to
her
by
some
kind
of
electricity
.
She
had
an
interesting
,
slightly
sweaty
smell
that
reminded
me
of
those
scallopy
leaves
of
sweet
fern
you
break
off
and
crush
between
your
fingers
for
the
musk
of
them
.
``
You
know
old
Jay
Cee
wo
n't
give
a
damn
if
that
story
's
in
tomorrow
or
Monday
.
''
Doreen
lit
a
cigarette
and
let
the
smoke
flare
slowly
from
her
nostrils
so
her
eyes
were
veiled
.
``
Jay
Cee
's
ugly
as
sin
,
''
Doreen
went
on
coolly
.
``
I
bet
that
old
husband
of
hers
turns
out
all
the
lights
before
he
gets
near
her
or
he
'd
puke
otherwise
.
''
Jay
Cee
was
my
boss
,
and
I
liked
her
a
lot
,
in
spite
of
what
Doreen
said
.
She
was
n't
one
of
the
fashion
magazine
gushers
with
fake
eyelashes
and
giddy
jewelry
.
Jay
Cee
had
brains
,
so
her
plug-ugly
looks
did
n't
seem
to
matter
.
She
read
a
couple
of
languages
and
knew
all
the
quality
writers
in
the
business
.
I
tried
to
imagine
Jay
Cee
out
of
her
strict
office
suit
and
luncheon-duty
hat
and
in
bed
with
her
fat
husband
,
but
I
just
could
n't
do
it
.
I
always
had
a
terribly
hard
time
trying
to
imagine
people
in
bed
together
.
Jay
Cee
wanted
to
teach
me
something
,
all
the
old
ladies
I
ever
knew
wanted
to
teach
me
something
,
but
I
suddenly
did
n't
think
they
had
anything
to
teach
me
.
I
fitted
the
lid
on
my
typewriter
and
clicked
it
shut
.
Doreen
grinned
.
``
Smart
girl
.
''
Somebody
tapped
at
the
door
.
``
Who
is
it
?
''
I
did
n't
bother
to
get
up
.
``
It
's
me
,
Betsy
.
Are
you
coming
to
the
party
?
''
``
I
guess
so
.
''
I
still
did
n't
go
to
the
door
.
They
imported
Betsy
straight
from
Kansas
with
her
bouncing
blonde
ponytail
and
Sweetheart-of-Sigma-Chi
smile
.
I
remember
once
the
two
of
us
were
called
over
to
the
office
of
some
blue-chinned
TV
producer
in
a
pin-stripe
suit
to
see
if
we
had
any
angles
he
could
build
up
for
a
program
,
and
Betsy
started
to
tell
about
the
male
and
female
corn
in
Kansas
.
She
got
so
excited
about
that
damn
corn
even
the
producer
had
tears
in
his
eyes
,
only
he
could
n't
use
any
of
it
,
unfortunately
,
he
said
.
Later
on
,
the
Beauty
Editor
persuaded
Betsy
to
cut
her
hair
and
made
a
cover
girl
out
of
her
,
and
I
still
see
her
fare
now
and
then
,
smiling
out
of
those
``
P.Q
.
's
wife
wears
B.H
.
Wragge
''
ads
.
Betsy
was
always
asking
me
to
do
things
with
her
and
the
other
girls
as
if
she
were
trying
to
save
me
in
some
way
.
She
never
asked
Doreen
.
In
private
,
Doreen
called
her
Pollyanna
Cowgirl
.
``
Do
you
want
to
come
in
our
cab
?
''
Betsy
said
through
the
door
.
Doreen
shook
her
head
.
``
That
's
all
right
,
Betsy
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
'm
going
with
Doreen
.
''
``
Okay
.
''
I
could
hear
Betsy
padding
off
down
the
hall
.
``
We
'll
just
go
till
we
get
sick
of
it
,
''
Doreen
told
me
,
stubbing
out
her
cigarette
in
the
base
of
my
bedside
reading
lamp
,
``
then
we
'll
go
out
on
the
town
.
Those
parties
they
stage
here
remind
me
of
the
old
dances
in
the
school
gym
.
Why
do
they
always
round
up
Yalies
?
They
're
so
stoo-pit
!
''
Buddy
Willard
went
to
Yale
,
but
now
I
thought
of
it
,
what
was
wrong
with
him
was
that
he
was
stupid
.
Oh
,
he
'd
managed
to
get
good
marks
all
right
,
and
to
have
an
affair
with
some
awful
waitress
on
the
Cape
by
the
name
of
Gladys
,
but
he
did
n't
have
one
speck
of
intuition
.
Doreen
had
intuition
.
Everything
she
said
was
like
a
secret
voice
speaking
straight
out
of
my
own
bones
.
We
were
stuck
in
the
theater-hour
rush
.
Our
cab
sat
wedged
in
back
of
Betsy
's
cab
and
in
front
of
a
cab
with
four
of
the
other
girls
,
and
nothing
moved
.
Doreen
looked
terrific
.
She
was
wearing
a
strapless
white
lace
dress
zipped
up
over
a
snug
corset
affair
that
curved
her
in
at
the
middle
and
bulged
her
out
again
spectacularly
above
and
below
,
and
her
skin
had
a
bronzy
polish
under
the
pale
dusting
powder
.
She
smelled
strong
as
a
whole
perfume
store
.
I
wore
a
black
shantung
sheath
that
cost
me
forty
dollars
.
It
was
part
of
a
buying
spree
I
had
with
some
of
my
scholarship
money
when
I
heard
I
was
one
of
the
lucky
ones
going
to
New
York
.
This
dress
was
cut
so
queerly
I
could
n't
wear
any
sort
of
a
bra
under
it
,
but
that
did
n't
matter
much
as
I
was
skinny
as
a
boy
and
barely
rippled
,
and
I
liked
feeling
almost
naked
on
the
hot
summer
nights
.
The
city
had
faded
my
tan
,
though
.
I
looked
yellow
as
a
Chinaman
.
Ordinarily
,
I
would
have
been
nervous
about
my
dress
and
my
odd
color
,
but
being
with
Doreen
made
me
forget
my
worries
.
I
felt
wise
and
cynical
as
all
hell
.
When
the
man
in
the
blue
lumber
shirt
and
black
chinos
and
tooled
leather
cowboy
boots
started
to
stroll
over
to
us
from
under
the
striped
awning
of
the
bar
where
he
'd
been
eyeing
our
cab
,
I
could
n't
have
any
illusions
.
I
knew
perfectly
well
he
'd
come
for
Doreen
.
He
threaded
his
way
out
between
the
stopped
cars
and
leaned
engagingly
on
the
sill
of
our
open
window
.
``
And
what
,
may
I
ask
,
are
two
nice
girls
like
you
doing
all
alone
in
a
cab
on
a
nice
night
like
this
?
''
He
had
a
big
,
wide
,
white
toothpaste-ad
smile
.
``
We
're
on
our
way
to
a
party
,
''
I
blurted
,
since
Doreen
had
gone
suddenly
dumb
as
a
post
and
was
fiddling
in
a
blasé
way
with
her
white
lace
pocketbook
cover
.
``
That
sounds
boring
,
''
the
man
said
.
``
Why
n't
you
both
join
me
for
a
couple
of
drinks
in
that
bar
over
there
?
I
've
some
friends
waiting
as
well
.
''
He
nodded
in
the
direction
of
several
informally
dressed
men
slouching
around
under
the
awning
.
They
had
been
following
him
with
their
eyes
,
and
when
he
glanced
back
at
them
,
they
burst
out
laughing
.
The
laughter
should
have
warned
me
.
It
was
a
kind
of
low
,
know-it-all
snicker
,
but
the
traffic
showed
signs
of
moving
again
,
and
I
knew
that
if
I
sat
tight
,
in
two
seconds
I
'd
be
wishing
I
'd
taken
this
gift
of
a
chance
to
see
something
of
New
York
besides
what
the
people
on
the
magazine
had
planned
out
for
us
so
carefully
.
``
How
about
it
,
Doreen
?
''
I
said
.
``
How
about
it
,
Doreen
?
''
the
man
said
,
smiling
his
big
smile
.
To
this
day
I
ca
n't
remember
what
he
looked
like
when
he
was
n't
smiling
.
I
think
he
must
have
been
smiling
the
whole
time
.
It
must
have
been
natural
for
him
,
smiling
like
that
.
``
Well
,
all
right
,
''
Doreen
said
to
me
.
I
opened
the
door
,
and
we
stepped
out
of
the
cab
just
as
it
was
edging
ahead
again
and
started
to
walk
over
to
the
bar
.
There
was
a
terrible
shriek
of
brakes
followed
by
a
dull
thump-thump
.
``
Hey
you
!
''
Our
cabby
was
craning
out
of
his
window
with
a
furious
,
purple
expression
.
``
Waddaya
think
you
're
doin
'
?
''
He
had
stopped
the
cab
so
abruptly
that
the
cab
behind
bumped
smack
into
him
,
and
we
could
see
the
four
girls
inside
waving
and
struggling
and
scrambling
up
off
the
floor
.
The
man
laughed
and
left
us
on
the
curb
and
went
back
and
handed
a
bill
to
the
driver
in
the
middle
of
a
great
honking
and
some
yelling
,
and
then
we
saw
the
girls
from
the
magazine
moving
off
in
a
row
,
one
cab
after
another
,
like
a
wedding
party
with
nothing
but
bridesmaids
.
``
Come
on
,
Frankie
,
''
the
man
said
to
one
of
his
friends
in
the
group
,
and
a
short
,
scrunty
fellow
detached
himself
and
came
into
the
bar
with
us
.
He
was
the
type
of
fellow
I
ca
n't
stand
.
I
'm
five
feet
ten
in
my
stocking
feet
,
and
when
I
am
with
little
men
I
stoop
over
a
bit
and
slouch
my
hips
,
one
up
and
one
down
,
so
I
'll
look
shorter
,
and
I
feel
gawky
and
morbid
as
somebody
in
a
sideshow
.
For
a
minute
I
had
a
wild
hope
we
might
pair
off
according
to
size
,
which
would
line
me
up
with
the
man
who
had
spoken
to
us
in
the
first
place
,
and
he
cleared
a
good
six
feet
,
but
he
went
ahead
with
Doreen
and
did
n't
give
me
a
second
look
.
I
tried
to
pretend
I
did
n't
see
Frankie
dogging
along
at
my
elbow
and
sat
close
by
Doreen
at
the
table
.
It
was
so
dark
in
the
bar
I
could
hardly
make
out
anything
except
Doreen
.
With
her
white
hair
and
white
dress
she
was
so
white
she
looked
silver
.
I
think
she
must
have
reflected
the
neons
over
the
bar
.
I
felt
myself
melting
into
the
shadows
like
the
negative
of
a
person
I
'd
never
seen
before
in
my
life
.
``
Well
,
what
'll
we
have
?
''
the
man
asked
with
a
large
smile
.
``
I
think
I
'll
have
an
old-fashioned
,
''
Doreen
said
to
me
.
Ordering
drinks
always
floored
me
.
I
did
n't
know
whisky
from
gin
and
never
managed
to
get
anything
I
really
liked
the
taste
of
.
Buddy
Willard
and
the
other
college
boys
I
knew
were
usually
too
poor
to
buy
hard
liquor
or
they
scorned
drinking
altogether
.
It
's
amazing
how
many
college
boys
do
n't
drink
or
smoke
.
I
seemed
to
know
them
all
.
The
farthest
Buddy
Willard
ever
went
was
buying
us
a
bottle
of
Dubonnet
,
which
he
only
did
because
he
was
trying
to
prove
he
could
be
aesthetic
in
spite
of
being
a
medical
student
.
``
I
'll
have
a
vodka
,
''
I
said
.
The
man
looked
at
me
more
closely
.
``
With
anything
?
''
``
Just
plain
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
always
have
it
plain
.
''
I
thought
I
might
make
a
fool
of
myself
by
saying
I
'd
have
it
with
ice
or
gin
or
anything
.
I
'd
seen
a
vodka
ad
once
,
just
a
glass
full
of
vodka
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
snowdrift
in
a
blue
light
,
and
the
vodka
looked
clear
and
pure
as
water
,
so
I
thought
having
vodka
plain
must
be
all
right
.
My
dream
was
someday
ordering
a
drink
and
finding
out
it
tasted
wonderful
.
The
waiter
came
up
then
,
and
the
man
ordered
drinks
for
the
four
of
us
.
He
looked
so
at
home
in
that
citified
bar
in
his
ranch
outfit
I
thought
he
might
well
be
somebody
famous
.
Doreen
was
n't
saying
a
word
,
she
only
toyed
with
her
cork
placemat
and
eventually
lit
a
cigarette
,
but
the
man
did
n't
seem
to
mind
.
He
kept
staring
at
her
the
way
people
stare
at
the
great
white
macaw
in
the
zoo
,
waiting
for
it
to
say
something
human
.
The
drinks
arrived
,
and
mine
looked
clear
and
pure
,
just
like
the
vodka
ad
.
``
What
do
you
do
?
''
I
asked
the
man
,
to
break
the
silence
shooting
up
around
me
on
all
sides
,
thick
as
jungle
grass
.
``
I
mean
what
do
you
do
here
in
New
York
?
''
Slowly
and
with
what
seemed
a
great
effort
,
the
man
dragged
his
eyes
away
from
Doreen
's
shoulder
.
``
I
'm
a
disc
jockey
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
prob'ly
must
have
heard
of
me
.
The
name
's
Lenny
Shepherd
.
''
``
I
know
you
,
''
Doreen
said
suddenly
.
``
I
'm
glad
about
that
,
honey
,
''
the
man
said
,
and
burst
out
laughing
.
``
That
'll
come
in
handy
.
I
'm
famous
as
hell
.
''
Then
Lenny
Shepherd
gave
Frankie
a
long
look
.
``
Say
,
where
do
you
come
from
?
''
Frankie
asked
,
sitting
up
with
a
jerk
.
``
What
's
your
name
?
''
``
This
here
's
Doreen
.
''
Lenny
slid
his
hand
around
Doreen
's
bare
arm
and
gave
her
a
squeeze
.
What
surprised
me
was
that
Doreen
did
n't
let
on
she
noticed
what
he
was
doing
.
She
just
sat
there
,
dusky
as
a
bleached-blonde
Negress
in
her
white
dress
,
and
sipped
daintily
at
her
drink
.
``
My
name
's
Elly
Higginbottom
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
come
from
Chicago
.
''
After
that
I
felt
safer
.
I
did
n't
want
anything
I
said
or
did
that
night
to
be
associated
with
me
and
my
real
name
and
coming
from
Boston
.
``
Well
,
Elly
,
what
do
you
say
we
dance
some
?
''
The
thought
of
dancing
with
that
little
runt
in
his
orange
suede
elevator
shoes
and
mingy
T-shirt
and
droopy
blue
sports
coat
made
me
laugh
.
If
there
's
anything
I
look
down
on
,
it
's
a
man
in
a
blue
outfit
.
Black
or
gray
,
or
brown
,
even
.
Blue
makes
me
laugh
.
``
I
'm
not
in
the
mood
,
''
I
said
coldly
,
turning
my
back
on
him
and
hitching
my
chair
over
nearer
to
Doreen
and
Lenny
.
Those
two
looked
as
if
they
'd
known
each
other
for
years
by
now
.
Doreen
was
spooning
up
the
hunks
of
fruit
at
the
bottom
of
her
glass
with
a
spindly
silver
spoon
,
and
Lenny
was
grunting
each
time
she
lifted
the
spoon
to
her
mouth
,
and
snapping
and
pretending
to
be
a
dog
or
something
,
and
trying
to
get
the
fruit
off
the
spoon
.
Doreen
giggled
and
kept
spooning
up
the
fruit
.
I
began
to
think
vodka
was
my
drink
at
last
.
It
did
n't
taste
like
anything
,
but
it
went
straight
down
into
my
stomach
like
a
sword
swallower
's
sword
and
made
me
feel
powerful
and
godlike
.
``
I
better
go
now
,
''
Frankie
said
,
standing
up
.
I
could
n't
see
him
very
clearly
,
the
place
was
so
dim
,
but
for
the
first
time
I
heard
what
a
high
,
silly
voice
he
had
.
Nobody
paid
him
any
notice
.
``
Hey
,
Lenny
,
you
owe
me
something
.
Remember
,
Lenny
,
you
owe
me
something
,
do
n't
you
,
Lenny
?
''
I
thought
it
odd
Frankie
should
be
reminding
Lenny
he
owed
him
something
in
front
of
us
,
and
we
being
perfect
strangers
,
but
Frankie
stood
there
saying
the
same
thing
over
and
over
until
Lenny
dug
into
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
big
roll
of
green
bills
and
peeled
one
off
and
handed
it
to
Frankie
.
I
think
it
was
ten
dollars
.
``
Shut
up
and
scram
.
''
For
a
minute
I
thought
Lenny
was
talking
to
me
as
well
,
but
then
I
heard
Doreen
say
,
``
I
wo
n't
come
unless
Elly
comes
.
''
I
had
to
hand
it
to
her
the
way
she
picked
up
my
fake
name
.
``
Oh
,
Elly
'll
come
,
wo
n't
you
,
Elly
?
''
Lenny
said
,
giving
me
a
wink
.
``
Sure
I
'll
come
,
''
I
said
.
Frankie
had
wilted
away
into
the
night
,
so
I
thought
I
'd
string
along
with
Doreen
.
I
wanted
to
see
as
much
as
I
could
.
I
liked
looking
on
at
other
people
in
crucial
situations
.
If
there
was
a
road
accident
or
a
street
fight
or
a
baby
pickled
in
a
laboratory
jar
for
me
to
look
at
,
I
'd
stop
and
look
so
hard
I
never
forgot
it
.
I
certainly
learned
a
lot
of
things
I
never
would
have
learned
otherwise
this
way
,
and
even
when
they
surprised
me
or
made
me
sick
I
never
let
on
,
but
pretended
that
's
the
way
I
knew
things
were
all
the
time
.
Two
I
would
n't
have
missed
Lenny
's
place
for
anything
.
It
was
built
exactly
like
the
inside
of
a
ranch
,
only
in
the
middle
of
a
New
York
apartment
house
.
He
'd
had
a
few
partitions
knocked
down
to
make
the
place
broaden
out
,
he
said
,
and
then
had
them
pine-panel
the
walls
and
fit
up
a
special
pine-paneled
bar
in
the
shape
of
a
horseshoe
.
I
think
the
floor
was
pine-paneled
,
too
.
Great
white
bearskins
lay
about
underfoot
,
and
the
only
furniture
was
a
lot
of
low
beds
covered
with
Indian
rugs
.
Instead
of
pictures
hung
up
on
the
walls
,
he
had
antlers
and
buffalo
horns
and
a
stuffed
rabbit
head
.
Lenny
jutted
a
thumb
at
the
meek
little
gray
muzzle
and
stiff
jackrabbit
ears
.
``
Ran
over
that
in
Las
Vegas
.
''
He
walked
away
across
the
room
,
his
cowboy
boots
echoing
like
pistol
shots
.
``
Acoustics
,
''
he
said
,
and
grew
smaller
and
smaller
until
he
vanished
through
a
door
in
the
distance
.
All
at
once
music
started
to
come
out
of
the
air
on
every
side
.
Then
it
stopped
,
and
we
heard
Lenny
's
voice
say
``
This
is
your
twelve
o'clock
disc
jock
,
Lenny
Shepherd
,
with
a
roundup
of
the
tops
in
pops
.
Number
Ten
in
the
wagon
train
this
week
is
none
other
than
that
little
yaller-haired
gal
you
been
hearin
'
so
much
about
lately
.
.
.
the
one
an
'
only
Sunflower
!
''
I
was
born
in
Kansas
,
I
was
bred
in
Kansas
,
And
when
I
marry
I
'll
be
wed
in
Kansas
.
.
.
``
What
a
card
!
''
Doreen
said
``
Is
n't
he
a
card
?
''
``
You
bet
,
''
I
said
.
``
Listen
,
Elly
,
do
me
a
favor
.
''
She
seemed
to
think
Elly
was
who
I
really
was
by
now
.
``
Sure
,
''
I
said
.
``
Stick
around
,
will
you
?
I
would
n't
have
a
chance
if
he
tried
anything
funny
.
Did
you
see
that
muscle
?
''
Doreen
giggled
.
Lenny
popped
out
of
the
back
room
.
``
I
got
twenty
grand
's
worth
of
recording
equipment
in
there
.
''
He
ambled
over
to
the
bar
and
set
out
three
glasses
and
a
silver
ice
bucket
and
a
big
pitcher
and
began
to
mix
drinks
from
several
different
bottles
.
.
.
.to
a
true-blue
gal
who
promised
she
would
wait
--
She
's
the
sunflower
of
the
Sunflower
State
.
``
Terrific
,
huh
?
''
Lenny
came
over
,
balancing
three
glasses
.
Big
drops
stood
out
on
them
like
sweat
,
and
the
ice
cubes
jingled
as
he
passed
them
around
.
Then
the
music
twanged
to
a
stop
,
and
we
heard
Lenny
's
voice
announcing
the
next
number
.
``
Nothing
like
listening
to
yourself
talk
.
Say
,
''
Lenny
's
eye
lingered
on
me
,
``
Frankie
vamoosed
,
you
ought
to
have
somebody
,
I
'll
call
up
one
of
the
fellers
.
''
``
That
's
okay
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
do
n't
have
to
do
that
.
''
I
did
n't
want
to
come
straight
out
and
ask
for
somebody
several
sizes
larger
than
Frankie
.
Lenny
looked
relieved
.
``
Just
so
's
you
do
n't
mind
.
I
would
n't
want
to
do
wrong
by
a
friend
of
Doreen
's
.
''
He
gave
Doreen
a
big
white
smile
.
``
Would
I
,
honeybun
?
''
He
held
out
a
hand
to
Doreen
,
and
without
a
word
they
both
started
to
jitterbug
,
still
hanging
onto
their
glasses
.
I
sat
cross-legged
on
one
of
the
beds
and
tried
to
look
devout
and
impassive
like
some
businessmen
I
once
saw
watching
an
Algerian
belly
dancer
,
but
as
soon
as
I
leaned
back
against
the
wall
under
the
stuffed
rabbit
,
the
bed
started
to
roll
out
into
the
room
,
so
I
sat
down
on
a
bearskin
on
the
floor
and
leaned
back
against
the
bed
instead
.
My
drink
was
wet
and
depressing
.
Each
time
I
took
another
sip
it
tasted
more
and
mere
like
dead
water
.
Around
the
middle
of
the
glass
there
was
painted
a
pink
lasso
with
yellow
polka
dots
.
I
drank
to
about
an
inch
below
the
lasso
and
waited
a
bit
,
and
when
I
went
to
take
another
sip
,
the
drink
was
up
to
lasso-level
again
.
Out
of
the
air
Lenny
's
voice
boomed
,
``
Wye
oh
wye
did
I
ever
leave
Wyoming
?
''
The
two
of
them
did
n't
even
stop
jitterbugging
during
the
intervals
.
I
felt
myself
shrinking
to
a
small
black
dot
against
all
those
red
and
white
rugs
and
that
pine
paneling
.
I
felt
like
a
hole
in
the
ground
.
There
is
something
demoralizing
about
watching
two
people
get
more
and
more
crazy
about
each
other
,
especially
when
you
are
the
only
extra
person
in
the
room
.
It
's
like
watching
Paris
from
an
express
caboose
heading
in
the
opposite
direction
--
every
second
the
city
gets
smaller
and
smaller
,
only
you
feel
it
's
really
you
getting
smaller
and
smaller
and
lonelier
and
lonelier
,
rushing
away
from
all
those
lights
and
that
excitement
at
about
a
million
miles
an
hour
.
Every
so
often
Lenny
and
Doreen
would
bang
into
each
other
and
kiss
and
then
swing
to
take
a
long
drink
and
close
in
on
each
other
again
.
I
thought
I
might
just
lie
down
on
the
bearskin
and
go
to
sleep
until
Doreen
felt
ready
to
go
back
to
the
hotel
.
Then
Lenny
gave
a
terrible
roar
.
I
sat
up
.
Doreen
was
hanging
on
to
Lenny
's
left
ear
lobe
with
her
teeth
.
``
Leggo
,
you
bitch
!
''
Lenny
stooped
,
and
Doreen
went
flying
up
on
to
his
shoulder
,
and
her
glass
sailed
out
of
her
hand
in
a
long
,
wide
arc
and
fetched
up
against
the
pine
paneling
with
a
silly
tinkle
.
Lenny
was
still
roaring
and
whirling
round
so
fast
I
could
n't
see
Doreen
's
face
.
I
noted
,
in
the
routine
way
you
notice
the
color
of
somebody
's
eyes
,
that
Doreen
's
breasts
had
popped
out
of
her
dress
and
were
swinging
out
slightly
like
full
brown
melons
as
she
circled
belly-down
on
Lenny
's
shoulder
,
thrashing
her
legs
in
the
air
and
screeching
,
and
then
they
both
started
to
laugh
and
slow
up
,
and
Lenny
was
trying
to
bite
Doreen
's
hip
through
her
skirt
when
I
let
myself
out
the
door
before
anything
more
could
happen
and
managed
to
get
downstairs
by
leaning
with
both
hands
on
the
banister
and
half
sliding
the
whole
way
.
I
did
n't
realize
Lenny
's
place
had
been
air-conditioned
until
I
wavered
out
onto
the
pavement
.
The
tropical
,
stale
heat
the
sidewalks
had
been
sucking
up
all
day
hit
me
in
the
face
like
a
last
insult
.
I
did
n't
know
where
in
the
world
I
was
.
For
a
minute
I
entertained
the
idea
of
taking
a
cab
to
the
party
after
all
,
but
decided
against
it
because
the
dance
might
be
over
by
now
,
and
I
did
n't
feel
like
ending
up
in
an
empty
barn
of
a
ballroom
strewn
with
confetti
and
cigarette
butts
and
crumpled
cocktail
napkins
.
I
walked
carefully
to
the
nearest
street
corner
,
brushing
the
wall
of
the
buildings
on
my
left
with
the
tip
of
one
finger
to
steady
myself
.
I
looked
at
the
street
sign
.
Then
I
took
my
New
York
street
map
out
of
my
pocketbook
.
I
was
exactly
forty-three
blocks
by
five
blocks
away
from
my
hotel
Walking
has
never
fazed
me
.
I
just
set
out
in
the
right
direction
,
counting
the
blocks
under
my
breath
,
and
when
I
walked
into
the
lobby
of
the
hotel
I
was
perfectly
sober
and
my
feet
only
slightly
swollen
,
but
that
was
my
own
fault
because
I
had
n't
bothered
to
wear
any
stockings
.
The
lobby
was
empty
except
for
a
night
clerk
dozing
in
his
lit
booth
among
the
key
rings
and
the
silent
telephones
.
I
slid
into
the
self-service
elevator
and
pushed
the
button
for
my
floor
.
The
doors
folded
shut
like
a
noiseless
accordion
.
Then
my
ears
went
funny
,
and
I
noticed
a
big
,
smudgy-eyed
Chinese
woman
staring
idiotically
into
my
face
.
It
was
only
me
,
of
course
.
I
was
appalled
to
see
how
wrinkled
and
used
up
I
looked
.
There
was
n't
a
soul
in
the
hall
.
I
let
myself
into
my
room
.
It
was
full
of
smoke
.
At
first
I
thought
the
smoke
had
materialized
out
of
thin
air
as
a
sort
of
judgment
,
but
then
I
remembered
it
was
Doreen
's
smoke
and
pushed
the
button
that
opened
the
window
vent
.
They
had
the
windows
fixed
so
you
could
n't
really
open
them
and
lean
out
,
and
for
some
reason
this
made
me
furious
.
By
standing
at
the
left
side
of
the
window
and
laying
my
cheek
to
the
woodwork
,
I
could
see
downtown
to
where
the
UN
balanced
itself
in
the
dark
,
like
a
weird
green
Martian
honeycomb
.
I
could
see
the
moving
red
and
white
lights
along
the
drive
and
the
lights
of
the
bridges
whose
names
I
did
n't
know
.
The
silence
depressed
me
.
It
was
n't
the
silence
of
silence
.
It
was
my
own
silence
.
I
knew
perfectly
well
the
cars
were
making
noise
,
and
the
people
in
them
and
behind
the
lit
windows
of
the
buildings
were
making
a
noise
,
and
the
river
was
making
a
nowise
,
but
I
could
n't
hear
a
thing
.
The
city
hung
in
my
window
,
flat
as
a
poster
,
glittering
and
blinking
,
but
it
might
just
as
well
not
have
been
there
at
all
,
for
all
the
good
it
did
me
.
The
china-white
bedside
telephone
could
have
connected
me
up
with
things
,
but
there
it
sat
,
dumb
as
a
death
's
head
.
I
tried
to
think
of
people
I
'd
given
my
phone
number
to
,
so
I
could
make
a
list
of
all
the
possible
calls
I
might
be
about
to
receive
,
but
all
I
could
think
of
was
that
I
'd
given
my
phone
number
to
Buddy
Willard
's
mother
so
she
could
give
it
to
a
simultaneous
interpreter
she
knew
at
the
UN
.
I
let
out
a
small
,
dry
laugh
.
I
could
imagine
the
sort
of
simultaneous
interpreter
Mrs.
Willard
would
introduce
me
to
when
all
the
time
she
wanted
me
to
marry
Buddy
,
who
was
taking
the
cure
for
TB
somewhere
in
upper
New
York
State
.
Buddy
's
mother
had
even
arranged
for
me
to
be
given
a
job
as
a
waitress
at
the
TB
sanatorium
that
summer
so
Buddy
would
n't
be
lonely
.
She
and
Buddy
could
n't
understand
why
I
chose
to
go
to
New
York
City
instead
.
The
mirror
over
my
bureau
seemed
slightly
warped
and
much
too
silver
.
The
face
in
it
looked
like
the
reflection
in
a
ball
of
dentist
's
mercury
.
I
thought
of
crawling
in
between
the
bed
sheets
and
trying
to
sleep
,
but
that
appealed
to
me
about
as
much
as
stuffing
a
dirty
,
scrawled-over
letter
into
a
fresh
,
clean
envelope
.
I
decided
to
take
a
hot
bath
.
There
must
be
quite
a
few
things
a
hot
bath
wo
n't
cure
,
but
I
do
n't
know
many
of
them
.
Whenever
I
'm
sad
I
'm
going
to
die
,
or
so
nervous
I
ca
n't
sleep
,
or
in
love
with
somebody
I
wo
n't
be
seeing
for
a
week
,
I
slump
down
just
so
far
and
then
I
say
:
``
I
'll
go
take
a
hot
bath
.
''
I
meditate
in
the
bath
.
The
water
needs
to
be
very
hot
,
so
hot
you
can
barely
stand
putting
your
foot
in
it
.
Then
you
lower
yourself
,
inch
by
inch
,
till
the
water
's
up
to
your
neck
.
I
remember
the
ceiling
over
every
bathtub
I
've
stretched
out
in
.
I
remember
the
texture
of
the
ceilings
and
the
cracks
and
the
colors
and
the
damp
spots
and
the
light
fixtures
.
I
remember
the
tubs
,
too
:
the
antique
griffin-legged
tubs
,
and
the
modern
coffin-
shaped
tubs
,
and
the
fancy
pink
marble
tubs
overlooking
indoor
lily
ponds
,
and
I
remember
the
shapes
and
sizes
of
the
water
taps
and
the
different
sorts
of
soap
holders
.
I
never
feel
so
much
myself
as
when
I
'm
in
a
hot
bath
.
I
lay
in
that
tub
on
the
seventeenth
floor
of
this
hotel
for-women-only
,
high
up
over
the
jazz
and
push
of
New
York
,
for
near
onto
an
hour
,
and
I
felt
myself
growing
pure
again
.
I
do
n't
believe
in
baptism
or
the
waters
of
Jordan
or
anything
like
that
,
but
I
guess
I
feel
about
a
hot
bath
the
way
those
religious
people
feel
about
holy
water
.
I
said
to
myself
:
``
Doreen
is
dissolving
,
Lenny
Shepherd
is
dissolving
,
Frankie
is
dissolving
,
New
York
is
dissolving
,
they
are
all
dissolving
away
and
none
of
them
matter
any
more
.
I
do
n't
know
them
,
I
have
never
known
them
and
I
am
very
pure
.
All
that
liquor
and
those
sticky
kisses
I
saw
and
the
dirt
that
settled
on
my
skin
on
the
way
back
is
turning
into
something
pure
.
''
The
longer
I
lay
there
in
the
clear
hot
water
the
purer
I
felt
,
and
when
I
stepped
out
at
last
and
wrapped
myself
in
one
of
the
big
,
soft
white
hotel
bath
towels
I
felt
pure
and
sweet
as
a
new
baby
.
I
do
n't
know
how
long
I
had
been
asleep
when
I
heard
the
knocking
.
I
did
n't
pay
any
attention
at
first
,
because
the
person
knocking
kept
saying
,
``
Elly
,
Elly
,
Elly
,
let
me
in
,
''
and
I
did
n't
know
any
Elly
.
Then
another
kind
of
knock
sounded
over
the
first
dull
,
bumping
knock-a
sharp
tap-tap
,
and
another
,
much
crisper
voice
said
,
``
Miss
Greenwood
,
your
friend
wants
you
,
''
and
I
knew
it
was
Doreen
.
I
swung
to
my
feet
and
balanced
dizzily
for
a
minute
in
the
middle
of
the
dark
room
.
I
felt
angry
with
Doreen
for
waking
me
up
.
All
I
stood
a
chance
of
getting
out
of
that
sad
night
was
a
good
sleep
,
and
she
had
to
wake
me
up
and
spoil
it
.
I
thought
if
I
pretended
to
be
asleep
the
knocking
might
go
away
and
leave
me
in
peace
,
but
I
waited
,
and
it
did
n't
.
``
Elly
,
Elly
,
Elly
,
''
the
first
voice
mumbled
,
while
the
other
voice
went
on
hissing
,
``
Miss
Greenwood
,
Miss
Greenwood
,
Miss
Greenwood
,
''
as
if
I
had
a
split
personality
or
something
.
I
opened
the
door
and
blinked
out
into
the
bright
hall
.
I
had
the
impression
it
was
n't
night
and
it
was
n't
day
,
but
some
lurid
third
interval
that
had
suddenly
slipped
between
them
and
would
never
end
.
Doreen
was
slumped
against
the
doorjamb
.
When
I
came
out
,
she
toppled
into
my
arms
.
I
could
n't
see
her
face
because
her
head
was
hanging
down
on
her
chest
and
her
stiff
blonde
hair
fell
down
from
its
dark
roots
like
a
hula
fringe
.
I
recognized
the
short
,
squat
,
mustached
woman
in
the
black
uniform
as
the
night
maid
who
ironed
day
dresses
and
party
frocks
in
a
crowded
cubicle
on
our
floor
.
I
could
n't
understand
how
she
came
to
know
Doreen
or
why
she
should
want
to
help
Doreen
wake
me
up
instead
of
leading
her
quietly
back
to
her
own
room
.
Seeing
Doreen
supported
in
my
arms
and
silent
except
for
a
few
wet
hiccups
,
the
woman
strode
away
down
the
hall
to
her
cubicle
with
its
ancient
Singer
sewing
machine
and
white
ironing
board
.
I
wanted
to
run
after
her
and
tell
her
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
Doreen
,
because
she
looked
stern
and
hardworking
and
moral
as
an
old-style
European
immigrant
and
reminded
me
of
my
Austrian
grandmother
.
``
Lem
me
lie
down
,
lem
me
lie
down
,
''
Doreen
was
muttering
.
``
Lem
me
lie
down
,
lem
me
lie
down
.
''
I
felt
if
I
carried
Doreen
across
the
threshold
into
my
room
and
helped
her
onto
my
bed
I
would
never
get
rid
of
her
again
.
Her
body
was
warm
and
soft
as
a
pile
of
pillows
against
my
arm
where
she
leaned
her
weight
,
and
her
feet
,
in
their
high
,
spiked
heels
,
dragged
foolishly
.
She
was
much
too
heavy
for
me
to
budge
down
the
long
hall
.
I
decided
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
dump
her
on
the
carpet
and
shut
and
lock
my
door
and
go
back
to
bed
.
When
Doreen
woke
up
she
would
n't
remember
what
had
happened
and
would
think
she
must
have
passed
out
in
front
of
my
door
while
I
slept
,
and
she
would
get
up
of
her
own
accord
and
go
sensibly
back
to
her
room
.
I
started
to
lower
Doreen
gently
onto
the
green
hall
carpet
,
but
she
gave
a
low
moan
and
pitched
forward
out
of
my
arms
.
A
jet
of
brown
vomit
flew
from
her
mouth
and
spread
in
a
large
puddle
at
my
feet
.
Suddenly
Doreen
grew
even
heavier
.
Her
head
drooped
forward
into
the
puddle
,
the
wisps
of
her
blonde
hair
dabbling
in
it
like
tree
roots
in
a
bog
,
and
I
realized
she
was
asleep
.
I
drew
back
.
I
felt
half-asleep
myself
.
I
made
a
decision
about
Doreen
that
night
.
I
decided
I
would
watch
her
and
listen
to
what
she
said
,
but
deep
down
I
would
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
her
.
Deep
down
,
I
would
be
loyal
to
Betsy
and
her
innocent
friends
.
It
was
Betsy
I
resembled
at
heart
.
Quietly
,
I
stepped
back
into
my
room
and
shut
the
door
.
On
second
thought
,
I
did
n't
lock
it
.
I
could
n't
quite
bring
myself
to
do
that
.
When
I
woke
up
in
the
dull
,
sunless
heat
the
next
morning
,
I
dressed
and
splashed
my
face
with
cold
water
and
put
on
some
lipstick
and
opened
the
door
slowly
.
I
think
I
still
expected
to
see
Doreen
's
body
lying
there
in
the
pool
of
vomit
like
an
ugly
,
concrete
testimony
to
my
own
dirty
nature
.
There
was
nobody
in
the
hall
.
The
carpet
stretched
from
one
end
of
the
hall
to
the
other
,
clean
and
eternally
verdant
except
for
a
faint
,
irregular
dark
stain
before
my
door
as
if
somebody
had
by
accident
spilled
a
glass
of
water
there
,
but
dabbed
it
dry
again
.
Three
ARRAYED
ON
THE
Ladies
Day
banquet
table
were
yellow-green
avocado
pear
halves
stuffed
with
crabmeat
and
mayonnaise
,
and
platters
of
rare
roast
beef
and
cold
chicken
,
and
every
so
often
a
cut-glass
bowl
heaped
with
black
caviar
.
I
had
n't
had
time
to
eat
any
breakfast
at
the
hotel
cafeteria
that
morning
,
except
for
a
cup
of
overstewed
coffee
so
bitter
it
made
my
nose
curl
,
and
I
was
starving
.
Before
I
came
to
New
York
I
'd
never
eaten
out
in
a
proper
restaurant
.
I
do
n't
count
Howard
Johnson
's
,
where
I
only
had
french
fries
and
cheeseburgers
and
vanilla
frappes
with
people
like
Buddy
Willard
.
I
'm
not
sure
why
it
is
,
but
I
love
food
more
than
just
about
anything
else
.
No
matter
how
much
I
eat
,
I
never
put
on
weight
.
With
one
exception
I
've
been
the
same
weight
for
ten
years
.
My
favorite
dishes
are
full
of
butter
and
cheese
and
sour
cream
.
In
New
York
we
had
so
many
free
luncheons
with
people
on
the
magazine
and
various
visiting
celebrities
I
developed
the
habit
of
running
my
eye
down
those
huge
handwritten
menus
,
where
a
tiny
side
dish
of
peas
cost
fifty
or
sixty
cents
,
until
I
'd
picked
the
richest
,
most
expensive
dishes
and
ordered
a
string
of
them
.
We
were
always
taken
out
on
expense
accounts
,
so
I
never
felt
guilty
.
I
made
a
point
of
eating
so
fast
I
never
kept
the
other
people
waiting
who
generally
ordered
only
chef
's
salad
and
grapefruit
juice
because
they
were
trying
to
reduce
.
Almost
everybody
I
met
in
New
York
was
trying
to
reduce
.
``
I
want
to
welcome
the
prettiest
,
smartest
bunch
of
young
ladies
our
staff
has
yet
had
the
good
luck
to
meet
,
''
the
plump
,
bald
master-of-ceremonies
wheezed
into
his
lapel
microphone
.
``
This
banquet
is
just
a
small
sample
of
the
hospitality
our
Food
Testing
Kitchens
here
on
Ladies
'
Day
would
like
to
offer
in
appreciation
for
your
visit
.
''
A
delicate
,
ladylike
spatter
of
applause
,
and
we
all
sat
at
the
enormous
linen-
draped
table
.
There
were
eleven
of
us
girls
from
the
magazine
,
together
with
most
of
our
supervising
editors
,
and
the
whole
staff
of
the
Ladies
'
Day
Food
Testing
Kitchens
in
hygienic
white
smocks
,
neat
hairnets
and
flawless
makeup
of
a
uniform
peach-pie
color
.
There
were
only
eleven
of
us
,
because
Doreen
was
missing
.
They
had
set
her
place
next
to
mine
for
some
reason
,
and
the
chair
stayed
empty
.
I
saved
her
placecard
for
her
--
a
pocket
mirror
with
``
Doreen
''
painted
along
the
top
of
it
in
lacy
script
and
a
wreath
of
frosted
daisies
around
the
edge
,
framing
the
silver
hole
where
her
face
would
show
.
Doreen
was
spending
the
day
with
Lenny
Shepherd
.
She
spent
most
of
her
free
time
with
Lenny
Shepherd
now
.
In
the
hour
before
our
luncheon
at
Ladies
'
Day
--
the
big
women
's
magazine
that
features
lush
double-page
spreads
of
Technicolor
meals
,
with
a
different
theme
and
locale
each
month
--
we
had
been
shown
around
the
endless
glossy
kitchens
and
seen
how
difficult
it
is
to
photograph
apple
pie
a
la
mode
under
bright
lights
because
the
ice
cream
keeps
melting
and
has
to
be
propped
up
from
behind
with
toothpicks
and
changed
every
time
it
starts
looking
too
soppy
.
The
sight
of
all
the
food
stacked
in
those
kitchens
made
me
dizzy
.
It
's
not
that
we
had
n't
enough
to
eat
at
home
,
it
's
just
that
my
grandmother
always
cooked
economy
joints
and
economy
meat
loafs
and
had
the
habit
of
saying
,
the
minute
you
lifted
the
first
forkful
to
your
mouth
,
``
I
hope
you
enjoy
that
,
it
cost
forty-one
cents
a
pound
,
''
which
always
made
me
feel
I
was
somehow
eating
pennies
instead
of
Sunday
roast
.
While
we
were
standing
up
behind
our
chairs
listening
to
the
welcome
speech
,
I
had
bowed
my
head
and
secretly
eyed
the
position
of
the
bowls
of
caviar
.
One
bowl
was
set
strategically
between
me
and
Doreen
's
empty
chair
.
I
figured
the
girl
across
from
me
could
n't
reach
it
because
of
the
mountainous
centerpiece
of
marzipan
fruit
,
and
Betsy
,
on
my
right
,
would
be
too
nice
to
ask
me
to
share
it
with
her
if
I
just
kept
it
out
of
the
way
at
my
elbow
by
my
bread-and-butter
plate
.
Besides
,
another
bowl
of
caviar
sat
a
little
way
to
the
right
of
the
girl
next
to
Betsy
,
and
she
could
eat
that
.
My
grandfather
and
I
had
a
standing
joke
.
He
was
the
head
waiter
at
a
country
club
near
my
home
town
,
and
every
Sunday
my
grandmother
drove
in
to
bring
him
home
for
his
Monday
off
.
My
brother
and
I
alternated
going
with
her
,
and
my
grandfather
always
served
Sunday
supper
to
my
grandmother
and
whichever
of
us
was
along
as
if
we
were
regular
club
guests
.
He
loved
introducing
me
to
special
tidbits
,
and
by
the
age
of
nine
I
had
developed
a
passionate
taste
for
cold
vichyssoise
and
caviar
and
anchovy
paste
.
The
joke
was
that
at
my
wedding
my
grandfather
would
see
I
had
all
the
caviar
I
could
eat
.
It
was
a
joke
because
I
never
intended
to
get
married
,
and
even
if
I
did
,
my
grandfather
could
n't
have
afforded
enough
caviar
unless
he
robbed
the
country
club
kitchen
and
carried
it
off
in
a
suitcase
.
Under
cover
of
the
clinking
of
water
goblets
and
silverware
and
bone
china
,
I
paved
my
plate
with
chicken
slices
.
Then
I
covered
the
chicken
slices
with
caviar
thickly
as
if
I
were
spreading
peanut
butter
on
a
piece
of
bread
.
Then
I
picked
up
the
chicken
slices
in
my
fingers
one
by
one
,
rolled
them
so
the
caviar
would
n't
ooze
off
and
ate
them
.
I
'd
discovered
,
after
a
lot
of
extreme
apprehension
about
what
spoons
to
use
,
that
if
you
do
something
incorrect
at
table
with
a
certain
arrogance
,
as
if
you
knew
perfectly
well
you
were
doing
it
properly
,
you
can
get
away
with
it
and
nobody
will
think
you
are
bad-mannered
or
poorly
brought
up
.
They
will
think
you
are
original
and
very
witty
.
I
learned
this
trick
the
day
Jay
Cee
took
me
to
lunch
with
a
famous
poet
.
He
wore
a
horrible
,
lumpy
,
speckled
brown
tweed
jacket
and
gray
pants
and
a
red-and-blue
checked
open-throated
jersey
in
a
very
formal
restaurant
full
of
fountains
and
chandeliers
,
where
all
the
other
men
were
dressed
in
dark
suits
and
immaculate
white
shirts
.
This
poet
ate
his
salad
with
his
fingers
,
leaf
by
leaf
,
while
talking
to
me
about
the
antithesis
of
nature
and
art
.
I
could
n't
take
my
eyes
off
the
pale
,
stubby
white
fingers
traveling
back
and
forth
from
the
poet
's
salad
bowl
to
the
poet
's
mouth
with
one
dripping
lettuce
leaf
after
another
.
Nobody
giggled
or
whispered
rude
remarks
.
The
poet
made
eating
salad
with
your
fingers
seem
to
be
the
only
natural
and
sensible
thing
to
do
.
None
of
our
magazine
editors
or
the
Ladies
'
Day
staff
members
sat
anywhere
near
me
,
and
Betsy
seemed
sweet
and
friendly
,
she
did
n't
even
seem
to
like
caviar
,
so
I
grew
more
and
more
confident
.
When
I
finished
my
first
plate
of
cold
chicken
and
caviar
,
I
laid
out
another
.
Then
I
tackled
the
avocado
and
crabmeat
salad
.
Avocados
are
my
favorite
fruit
.
Every
Sunday
my
grandfather
used
to
bring
me
an
avocado
pear
hidden
at
the
bottom
of
his
briefcase
under
six
soiled
shirts
and
the
Sunday
comics
.
He
taught
me
how
to
eat
avocados
by
melting
grape
jelly
and
french
dressing
together
in
a
saucepan
and
filling
the
cup
of
the
pear
with
the
garnet
sauce
.
I
felt
homesick
for
that
sauce
.
The
crabmeat
tasted
bland
in
comparison
.
``
How
was
the
fur
show
?
''
I
asked
Betsy
,
when
I
was
no
longer
worried
about
competition
over
my
caviar
.
I
scraped
the
last
few
salty
black
eggs
from
the
dish
with
my
soup
spoon
and
licked
it
clean
.
``
It
was
wonderful
,
''
Betsy
smiled
.
``
They
showed
us
how
to
make
an
all-purpose
neckerchief
out
of
mink
tails
and
a
gold
chain
,
the
sort
of
chain
you
can
get
an
exact
copy
of
at
Woolworth
's
for
a
dollar
ninety-eight
,
and
Hilda
nipped
down
to
the
wholesale
fur
warehouses
right
afterward
and
bought
a
bunch
of
mink
tails
at
a
big
discount
and
dropped
in
at
Woolworth
's
and
then
stitched
the
whole
thing
together
coming
up
on
the
bus
.
''
I
peered
over
at
Hilda
,
who
sat
on
the
other
side
of
Betsy
.
Sure
enough
,
she
was
wearing
an
expensive-looking
scarf
of
furry
tails
fastened
on
one
side
by
a
dangling
gilt
chain
.
I
never
really
understood
Hilda
.
She
was
six
feet
tall
,
with
huge
,
slanted
green
eyes
and
thick
red
lips
and
a
vacant
,
Slavic
expression
.
She
made
hats
.
She
was
apprenticed
to
the
Fashion
Editor
,
which
set
her
apart
from
the
more
literary
ones
among
us
like
Doreen
and
Betsy
and
I
myself
,
who
all
wrote
columns
,
even
if
some
of
them
were
only
about
health
and
beauty
.
I
do
n't
know
if
Hilda
could
read
,
but
she
made
startling
hats
.
She
went
to
a
special
school
for
making
hats
in
New
York
and
every
day
she
wore
a
new
hat
to
work
,
constructed
by
her
own
hands
out
of
bits
of
straw
or
fur
or
ribbon
or
veiling
in
subtle
shades
.
``
That
's
amazing
,
''
I
said
.
``
Amazing
.
''
I
missed
Doreen
.
She
would
have
murmured
some
fine
,
scalding
remark
about
Hilda
's
miraculous
furpiece
to
cheer
me
up
.
I
felt
very
low
.
I
had
been
unmasked
only
that
morning
by
Jay
Cee
herself
,
and
I
felt
now
that
all
the
uncomfortable
suspicions
I
had
about
myself
were
coming
true
,
and
I
could
n't
hide
the
truth
much
longer
.
After
nineteen
years
of
running
after
good
marks
and
prizes
and
grants
of
one
sort
and
another
,
I
was
letting
up
,
slowing
down
,
dropping
clean
out
of
the
race
.
``
Why
did
n't
you
come
along
to
the
fur
show
with
us
?
''
Betsy
asked
.
I
had
the
impression
she
was
repeating
herself
,
and
that
she
'd
asked
me
the
same
question
a
minute
ago
,
only
I
could
n't
have
been
listening
.
``
Did
you
go
off
with
Doreen
?
''
``
No
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
wanted
to
go
to
the
fur
show
,
but
Jay
Cee
called
up
and
made
me
come
into
the
office
.
''
That
was
n't
quite
true
about
wanting
to
go
to
the
show
,
but
I
tried
to
convince
myself
now
that
it
was
true
,
so
I
could
be
really
wounded
about
what
Jay
Cee
had
done
.
I
told
Betsy
how
I
had
been
lying
in
bed
that
morning
planning
to
go
to
the
fur
show
.
What
I
did
n't
tell
her
was
that
Doreen
had
come
into
my
room
earlier
and
said
,
``
What
do
you
want
to
go
to
that
assy
show
for
,
Lenny
and
I
are
going
to
Coney
Island
,
so
why
do
n't
you
come
along
?
Lenny
can
get
you
a
nice
fellow
,
the
day
's
shot
to
hell
anyhow
with
that
luncheon
and
then
the
film
première
in
the
afternoon
,
so
nobody
'll
miss
us
.
''
For
a
minute
I
was
tempted
.
The
show
certainly
did
seem
stupid
.
I
have
never
cared
for
furs
.
What
I
decided
to
do
in
the
end
was
lie
in
bed
as
long
as
I
wanted
to
and
then
go
to
Central
Park
and
spend
the
day
lying
in
the
grass
,
the
longest
grass
I
could
find
in
that
bald
,
duck-ponded
wilderness
.
I
told
Doreen
I
would
not
go
to
the
show
or
the
luncheon
or
the
film
première
,
but
that
I
would
not
go
to
Coney
Island
either
,
I
would
stay
in
bed
.
After
Doreen
left
,
I
wondered
why
I
could
n't
go
the
whole
way
doing
what
I
should
any
more
.
This
made
me
sad
and
tired
.
Then
I
wondered
why
I
could
n't
go
the
whole
way
doing
what
I
should
n't
,
the
way
Doreen
did
,
and
this
made
me
even
sadder
and
more
tired
.
I
did
n't
know
what
time
it
was
,
but
I
'd
heard
the
girls
bustling
and
calling
in
the
hall
and
getting
ready
for
the
fur
show
,
and
then
I
'd
heard
the
hall
go
still
,
and
as
I
lay
on
my
back
in
bed
staring
up
at
the
blank
,
white
ceiling
the
stillness
seemed
to
grow
bigger
and
bigger
until
I
felt
my
eardrums
would
burst
with
it
.
Then
the
phone
rang
.
I
stared
at
the
phone
for
a
minute
.
The
receiver
shook
a
bit
in
its
bone-colored
cradle
,
so
I
could
tell
it
was
really
ringing
.
I
thought
I
might
have
given
my
phone
number
to
somebody
at
a
dance
or
a
party
and
then
forgotten
about
it
.
I
lifted
the
receiver
and
spoke
in
a
husky
,
receptive
voice
.
``
Hello
?
''
``
Jay
Cee
here
,
''
Jay
Cee
rapped
out
with
brutal
promptitude
.
``
I
wondered
if
you
happened
to
be
planning
to
come
into
the
office
today
?
''
I
sank
down
into
the
sheets
.
I
could
n't
understand
why
Jay
Cee
thought
I
'd
be
coming
into
the
office
.
We
had
these
mimeographed
schedule
cards
so
we
could
keep
track
of
all
our
activities
,
and
we
spent
a
lot
of
mornings
and
afternoons
away
from
the
office
going
to
affairs
in
town
.
Of
course
,
some
of
the
affairs
were
optional
.
There
was
quite
a
pause
.
Then
I
said
meekly
,
``
I
thought
I
was
going
to
the
fur
show
.
''
Of
course
I
had
n't
thought
any
such
thing
,
but
I
could
n't
figure
out
what
else
to
say
.
``
I
told
her
I
thought
I
was
going
to
the
fur
show
,
''
I
said
to
Betsy
.
``
But
she
told
me
to
come
into
the
office
,
she
wanted
to
have
a
little
talk
with
me
,
and
there
was
some
work
to
do
.
''
``
Oh-oh
!
''
Betsy
said
sympathetically
.
She
must
have
seen
the
tears
that
plopped
down
into
my
dessert
dish
of
meringue
and
brandy
ice
cream
,
because
she
pushed
over
her
own
untouched
dessert
and
I
started
absently
on
that
when
I
'd
finished
my
own
.
I
felt
a
bit
awkward
about
the
tears
,
but
they
were
real
enough
.
Jay
Cee
had
said
some
terrible
things
to
me
.
When
I
made
my
wan
entrance
into
the
office
at
about
ten
o'clock
,
Jay
Cee
stood
up
and
came
round
her
desk
to
shut
the
door
,
and
I
sat
in
the
swivel
chair
in
front
of
my
typewriter
table
facing
her
,
and
she
sat
in
the
swivel
chair
behind
her
desk
facing
me
,
with
the
window
full
of
potted
plants
,
shelf
after
shelf
of
them
,
springing
up
at
her
back
like
a
tropical
garden
.
``
Does
n't
your
work
interest
you
,
Esther
?
''
``
Oh
,
it
does
,
it
does
,
''
I
said
.
``
It
interests
me
very
much
.
''
I
felt
like
yelling
the
words
,
as
if
that
might
make
them
more
convincing
,
but
I
controlled
myself
.
All
my
life
I
'd
told
myself
studying
and
reading
and
writing
and
working
like
mad
was
what
I
wanted
to
do
,
and
it
actually
seemed
to
be
true
,
I
did
everything
well
enough
and
got
all
A
's
,
and
by
the
time
I
made
it
to
college
nobody
could
stop
me
.
I
was
college
correspondent
for
the
town
Gazette
and
editor
of
the
literary
magazine
and
secretary
of
Honor
Board
,
which
deals
with
academic
and
social
offenses
and
punishments
--
a
popular
office
--
and
I
had
a
well-known
woman
poet
and
professor
on
the
faculty
championing
me
for
graduate
school
at
the
biggest
universities
in
the
east
,
and
promises
of
full
scholarships
all
the
way
,
and
now
I
was
apprenticed
to
the
best
editor
on
an
intellectual
fashion
magazine
,
and
what
did
I
do
but
balk
and
balk
like
a
dull
cart
horse
?
``
I
'm
very
interested
in
everything
.
''
The
words
fell
with
a
hollow
flatness
on
to
Jay
Cee
's
desk
,
like
so
many
wooden
nickels
.
``
I
'm
glad
of
that
,
''
Jay
Cee
said
a
bit
waspishly
.
``
You
can
learn
a
lot
in
this
month
on
the
magazine
,
you
know
,
if
you
just
roll
up
your
shirtsleeves
.
The
girl
who
was
here
before
you
did
n't
bother
with
any
of
the
fashion-show
stuff
.
She
went
straight
from
this
office
on
to
Time
.
''
``
My
!
''
I
said
,
in
the
same
sepulchral
tone
.
``
That
was
quick
!
''
``
Of
course
,
you
have
another
year
at
college
yet
,
''
Jay
Cee
went
on
a
little
more
mildly
.
``
What
do
you
have
in
mind
after
you
graduate
?
''
What
I
always
thought
I
had
in
mind
was
getting
some
big
scholarship
to
graduate
school
or
a
grant
to
study
all
over
Europe
,
and
then
I
thought
I
'd
be
a
professor
and
write
books
of
poems
or
write
books
of
poems
and
be
an
editor
of
some
sort
.
Usually
I
had
these
plans
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
.
``
I
do
n't
really
know
,
''
I
heard
myself
say
.
I
felt
a
deep
shock
,
hearing
myself
say
that
,
because
the
minute
I
said
it
,
I
knew
it
was
true
.
It
sounded
true
,
and
I
recognized
it
,
the
way
you
recognize
some
nondescript
person
that
's
been
hanging
around
your
door
for
ages
and
then
suddenly
comes
up
and
introduces
himself
as
your
real
father
and
looks
exactly
like
you
,
so
you
know
he
really
is
your
father
,
and
the
person
you
thought
all
your
life
was
your
father
is
a
sham
.
``
I
do
n't
really
know
.
''
``
You
'll
never
get
anywhere
like
that
.
''
Jay
Cee
paused
.
``
What
languages
do
you
have
?
''
``
Oh
,
I
can
read
a
bit
of
French
,
I
guess
,
and
I
've
always
wanted
to
learn
German
.
''
I
'd
been
telling
people
I
'd
always
wanted
to
learn
German
for
about
five
years
.
My
mother
spoke
German
during
her
childhood
in
America
and
was
stoned
for
it
during
the
First
World
War
by
the
children
at
school
.
My
German-speaking
father
,
dead
since
I
was
nine
,
came
from
some
manic-depressive
hamlet
in
the
black
heart
of
Prussia
.
My
youngest
brother
was
at
that
moment
on
the
Experiment
in
International
Living
in
Berlin
and
speaking
German
like
a
native
.
What
I
did
n't
say
was
that
each
time
I
picked
up
a
German
dictionary
or
a
German
book
,
the
very
sight
of
those
dense
,
black
,
barbed-wire
letters
made
my
mind
shut
like
a
clam
.
``
I
've
always
thought
I
'd
like
to
go
into
publishing
.
''
I
tried
to
recover
a
thread
that
might
lead
me
back
to
my
old
,
bright
salesmanship
.
``
I
guess
what
I
'll
do
is
apply
at
some
publishing
house
.
''
``
You
ought
to
read
French
and
German
,
''
Jay
Cee
said
mercilessly
,
``
and
probably
several
other
languages
as
well
,
Spanish
and
Italian
--
better
still
,
Russian
,
Hundreds
of
girls
flood
into
New
York
every
June
thinking
they
'll
be
editors
.
You
need
to
offer
something
more
than
the
run-of-the-mill
person
.
You
better
learn
some
languages
.
''
I
had
n't
the
heart
to
tell
Jay
Cee
there
was
n't
one
scrap
of
space
on
my
senior
year
schedule
to
learn
languages
in
.
I
was
taking
one
of
those
honors
programs
that
teach
you
to
think
independently
,
and
except
for
a
course
in
Tolstoy
and
Dostoevsky
and
a
seminar
in
advanced
poetry
composition
,
I
would
spend
my
whole
time
writing
on
some
obscure
theme
in
the
works
of
James
Joyce
.
I
had
n't
picked
out
my
theme
yet
,
because
I
had
n't
got
round
to
reading
Finnegans
Wake
,
but
my
professor
was
very
excited
about
my
thesis
and
had
promised
to
give
me
some
leads
on
images
about
twins
.
``
I
'll
see
what
I
can
do
,
''
I
told
Jay
Cee
.
``
I
probably
might
just
fit
in
one
of
those
double-barreled
accelerated
courses
in
elementary
German
they
've
rigged
up
.
''
I
thought
at
the
time
I
might
actually
do
this
.
I
had
a
way
of
persuading
my
Class
Dean
to
let
me
do
irregular
things
.
She
regarded
me
as
a
sort
of
interesting
experiment
.
At
college
I
had
to
take
a
required
course
in
physics
and
chemistry
.
I
had
already
taken
a
course
in
botany
and
done
very
well
.
I
never
answered
one
test
question
wrong
the
whole
year
,
and
for
a
while
I
toyed
with
the
idea
of
being
a
botanist
and
studying
the
wild
grasses
in
Africa
or
the
South
American
rain
forests
,
because
you
can
win
big
grants
to
study
offbeat
things
like
that
in
queer
areas
much
more
easily
than
winning
grants
to
study
art
in
Italy
or
English
in
England
;
there
's
not
so
much
competition
.
Botany
was
fine
,
because
I
loved
cutting
up
leaves
and
putting
them
under
the
microscope
and
drawing
diagrams
of
bread
mold
and
the
odd
,
heart-shaped
leaf
in
the
sex
cycle
of
the
fern
,
it
seemed
so
real
to
me
.
The
day
I
went
into
physics
class
it
was
death
.
A
short
dark
man
with
a
high
lisping
voice
,
named
Mr.
Manzi
,
stood
in
front
of
the
class
in
a
tight
blue
suit
holding
a
little
wooden
ball
.
He
put
the
ball
on
a
steep
grooved
slide
and
let
it
run
down
to
the
bottom
.
Then
he
started
talking
about
let
a
equal
acceleration
and
let
t
equal
time
and
suddenly
he
was
scribbling
letters
and
numbers
and
equals
signs
all
over
the
blackboard
and
my
mind
went
dead
.
I
took
the
physics
book
back
to
my
dormitory
.
It
was
a
huge
book
on
porous
mimeographed
paper
--
four
hundred
pages
long
with
no
drawings
or
photographs
,
only
diagrams
and
formulas
--
between
brick-red
cardboard
covers
.
This
book
was
written
by
Mr.
Manzi
to
explain
physics
to
college
girls
,
and
if
it
worked
on
us
he
would
try
to
have
it
published
.
Well
,
I
studied
those
formulas
,
I
went
to
class
and
watched
balls
roll
down
slides
and
listened
to
bells
ring
and
by
the
end
of
the
semester
most
of
the
other
girls
had
failed
and
I
had
a
straight
A.
I
heard
Mr.
Manzi
saying
to
a
bunch
of
the
girls
who
were
complaining
that
the
course
was
too
hard
,
``
No
,
it
ca
n't
be
too
hard
,
because
one
girl
got
a
straight
A
.
''
``
Who
is
it
?
Tell
us
,
''
they
said
,
but
he
shook
his
head
and
did
n't
say
anything
and
gave
me
a
sweet
little
conspiring
smile
.
That
's
what
gave
me
the
idea
of
escaping
the
next
semester
of
chemistry
.
I
may
have
made
a
straight
A
in
physics
,
but
I
was
panic-struck
.
Physics
made
me
sick
the
whole
time
I
learned
it
.
What
I
could
n't
stand
was
this
shrinking
everything
into
letters
and
numbers
.
Instead
of
leaf
shapes
and
enlarged
diagrams
of
the
holes
the
leaves
breathe
through
and
fascinating
words
like
carotene
and
xanthophyll
on
the
blackboard
,
there
were
these
hideous
,
cramped
,
scorpion-lettered
formulas
in
Mr.
Manzi
's
special
red
chalk
I
knew
chemistry
would
be
worse
,
because
I
'd
seen
a
big
chart
of
the
ninety-odd
elements
hung
up
in
the
chemistry
lab
,
and
all
the
perfectly
good
words
like
gold
and
silver
and
cobalt
and
aluminum
were
shortened
to
ugly
abbreviations
with
different
decimal
numbers
after
them
.
If
I
had
to
strain
my
brain
with
any
more
of
that
stuff
I
would
go
mad
.
I
would
fail
outright
.
It
was
only
by
a
horrible
effort
of
will
that
I
had
dragged
myself
through
the
first
half
of
the
year
.
So
I
went
to
my
Class
Dean
with
a
clever
plan
.
My
plan
was
that
I
needed
the
time
to
take
a
course
in
Shakespeare
,
since
I
was
,
after
all
,
an
English
major
.
She
knew
and
I
knew
perfectly
well
I
would
get
a
straight
A
again
in
the
chemistry
course
,
so
what
was
the
point
of
my
taking
the
exams
;
why
could
n't
I
just
go
to
the
classes
and
look
on
and
take
it
all
in
and
forget
about
marks
or
credits
?
It
was
a
case
of
honor
among
honorable
people
,
and
the
content
meant
more
than
the
form
,
and
marks
were
really
a
bit
silly
anyway
,
were
n't
they
,
when
you
knew
you
'd
always
get
an
A
?
My
plan
was
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
the
college
had
just
dropped
the
second
year
of
required
science
for
the
classes
after
me
anyway
,
so
my
class
was
the
last
to
suffer
under
the
old
ruling
.
Mr.
Manzi
was
in
perfect
agreement
with
my
plan
.
I
think
it
flattered
him
that
I
enjoyed
his
classes
so
much
I
take
them
for
no
materialistic
reason
like
credit
and
an
A
,
but
for
the
sheer
beauty
of
chemistry
itself
.
I
thought
it
was
quite
ingenious
of
me
to
suggest
sitting
in
on
the
chemistry
course
even
after
I
'd
changed
over
to
Shakespeare
.
It
was
quite
an
unnecessary
gesture
and
made
it
seem
I
simply
could
n't
bear
to
give
chemistry
up
.
Of
course
,
I
would
never
have
succeeded
with
this
scheme
if
I
had
n't
made
that
A
in
the
first
place
.
And
if
my
Class
Dean
had
known
how
scared
and
depressed
I
was
,
and
how
I
seriously
contemplated
desperate
remedies
such
as
getting
a
doctor
's
certificate
that
I
was
unfit
to
study
chemistry
,
the
formulas
made
me
dizzy
and
so
on
,
I
'm
sure
she
would
n't
have
listened
to
me
for
a
minute
,
but
would
have
made
me
take
the
course
regardless
.
As
it
happened
,
the
Faculty
Board
passed
my
petition
,
and
my
Class
Dean
told
me
later
that
several
of
the
professors
were
touched
by
it
.
They
took
it
as
a
real
step
in
intellectual
maturity
.
I
had
to
laugh
when
I
thought
about
the
rest
of
that
year
.
I
went
to
the
chemistry
class
five
times
a
week
and
did
n't
miss
a
single
one
.
Mr.
Manzi
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
big
,
rickety
old
amphitheater
,
making
blue
flames
and
red
flares
and
clouds
of
yellow
stuff
by
pouring
the
contents
of
one
test
tube
into
another
,
and
I
shut
his
voice
out
of
my
ears
by
pretending
it
was
only
a
mosquito
in
the
distance
and
sat
back
enjoying
the
bright
lights
and
the
colored
fires
and
wrote
page
after
page
of
villanelles
and
sonnets
.
Mr.
Manzi
would
glance
at
me
now
and
then
and
see
me
writing
,
and
send
up
a
sweet
little
appreciative
smile
.
I
guess
he
thought
I
was
writing
down
all
those
formulas
not
for
exam
time
,
like
the
other
girls
,
but
because
his
presentation
fascinated
me
so
much
I
could
n't
help
it
.
Four
I
DO
N'T
KNOW
just
why
my
successful
evasion
of
chemistry
should
have
floated
into
my
mind
there
in
Jay
Cee
's
office
.
All
the
time
she
talked
to
me
,
I
saw
Mr.
Manzi
standing
on
thin
air
in
back
of
Jay
Cee
's
head
,
like
something
conjured
up
out
of
a
hat
,
holding
his
little
wooden
ball
and
the
test
tube
that
billowed
a
great
cloud
of
yellow
smoke
the
day
before
Easter
vacation
and
smelt
of
rotten
eggs
and
made
all
the
girls
and
Mr.
Manzi
laugh
.
I
felt
sorry
for
Mr.
Manzi
.
I
felt
like
going
down
to
him
on
my
hands
and
knees
and
apologizing
for
being
such
an
awful
liar
.
Jay
Cee
handed
me
a
pile
of
story
manuscripts
and
spoke
to
me
much
more
kindly
.
I
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
reading
the
stories
and
typing
out
what
I
thought
of
them
on
the
pink
Interoffice
Memo
sheets
and
sending
them
into
the
office
of
Betsy
's
editor
to
be
read
by
Betsy
the
next
day
.
Jay
Cee
interrupted
me
now
and
then
to
tell
me
something
practical
or
a
bit
of
gossip
.
Jay
Cee
was
going
to
lunch
that
noon
with
two
famous
writers
,
a
man
and
a
lady
.
The
man
had
just
sold
six
short
stories
to
the
New
Yorker
and
six
to
Jay
Cee
.
This
surprised
me
,
as
I
did
n't
know
magazines
bought
stories
in
lots
of
six
,
and
I
was
staggered
by
the
thought
of
the
amount
of
money
six
stories
would
probably
bring
in
.
Jay
Cee
said
she
had
to
be
very
careful
at
this
lunch
,
because
the
lady
writer
wrote
stories
too
,
but
she
had
never
had
any
in
the
New
Yorker
and
Jay
Cee
had
only
taken
one
from
her
in
five
years
.
Jay
Cee
had
to
flatter
the
more
famous
man
at
the
same
time
as
she
was
careful
not
to
hurt
the
less
famous
lady
.
When
the
cherubs
in
Jay
Cee
's
French
wall
clock
waved
their
wings
up
and
down
and
put
their
little
gilt
trumpets
to
their
lips
and
pinged
out
twelve
notes
one
after
the
other
,
Jay
Cee
told
me
I
'd
done
enough
work
for
the
day
,
and
to
go
off
to
the
Ladies
'
Day
tour
and
banquet
and
to
the
film
première
,
and
she
would
see
me
bright
and
early
tomorrow
.
Then
she
slipped
a
suit
jacket
over
her
lilac
blouse
,
pinned
a
hat
of
imitation
lilacs
on
the
top
of
her
head
,
powdered
her
nose
briefly
and
adjusted
her
thick
spectacles
.
She
looked
terrible
,
but
very
wise
.
As
she
left
the
office
,
she
patted
my
shoulder
with
one
lilac-gloved
hand
.
``
Do
n't
let
the
wicked
city
get
you
down
.
''
I
sat
quietly
in
my
swivel
chair
for
a
few
minutes
and
thought
about
Jay
Cee
.
I
tried
to
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
if
I
were
Ee
Gee
,
the
famous
editor
,
in
an
office
full
of
potted
rubber
plants
and
African
violets
my
secretary
had
to
water
each
morning
.
I
wished
I
had
a
mother
like
Jay
Cee
.
Then
I
'd
know
what
to
do
.
My
own
mother
was
n't
much
help
.
My
mother
had
taught
shorthand
and
typing
to
support
us
ever
since
my
father
died
,
and
secretly
she
hated
it
and
hated
him
for
dying
and
leaving
no
money
because
he
did
n't
trust
life
insurance
salesmen
.
She
was
always
on
to
me
to
learn
shorthand
after
college
,
so
I
'd
have
a
practical
skill
as
well
as
a
college
degree
.
``
Even
the
apostles
were
tentmakers
,
''
she
'd
say
.
``
They
had
to
live
,
just
the
way
we
do
.
''
I
dabbled
my
fingers
in
the
bowl
of
warm
water
a
Ladies
'
Day
waitress
set
down
in
place
of
my
two
empty
ice
cream
dishes
.
Then
I
wiped
each
finger
carefully
with
my
linen
napkin
which
was
still
quite
clean
.
Then
I
folded
the
linen
napkin
and
laid
it
between
my
lips
and
brought
my
lips
down
on
it
precisely
.
When
I
put
the
napkin
back
on
the
table
a
fuzzy
pink
lip
shape
bloomed
right
in
the
middle
of
it
like
a
tiny
heart
.
I
thought
what
a
long
way
I
had
come
.
The
first
time
I
saw
a
fingerbowl
was
at
the
home
of
my
benefactress
.
It
was
the
custom
at
my
college
,
the
little
freckled
lady
in
the
Scholarships
Office
told
me
,
to
write
to
the
person
whose
scholarship
you
had
,
if
they
were
still
alive
,
and
thank
them
for
it
I
had
the
scholarship
of
Philomena
Guinea
,
a
wealthy
novelist
who
went
to
my
college
in
the
early
nineteen
hundreds
and
had
her
first
novel
made
into
a
silent
film
with
Bette
Davis
as
well
as
a
radio
serial
that
was
still
running
,
and
it
turned
out
she
was
alive
and
lived
in
a
large
mansion
not
far
from
my
grandfather
's
country
club
.
So
I
wrote
Philomena
Guinea
a
long
letter
in
coal-black
ink
on
gray
paper
with
the
name
of
the
college
embossed
on
it
in
red
.
I
wrote
what
the
leaves
looked
like
in
autumn
when
I
bicycled
out
into
the
hills
,
and
how
wonderful
it
was
to
live
on
a
campus
instead
of
commuting
by
bus
to
a
city
college
and
having
to
live
at
home
,
and
how
all
knowledge
was
opening
up
before
me
and
perhaps
one
day
I
would
be
able
to
write
great
books
the
way
she
did
.
I
had
read
one
of
Mrs
.
Guinea
's
books
in
the
town
library
--
the
college
library
did
n't
stock
them
for
some
reason
--
and
it
was
crammed
from
beginning
to
end
with
long
,
suspenseful
questions
:
``
Would
Evelyn
discern
that
Gladys
knew
Roger
in
her
past
?
wondered
Hector
feverishly
''
and
``
How
could
Donald
marry
her
when
he
learned
of
the
child
Elsie
,
hidden
away
with
Mrs.
Rollmop
on
the
secluded
country
farm
?
Griselda
demanded
of
her
bleak
,
moonlit
pillow
.
''
These
books
earned
Philomena
Guinea
,
who
later
told
me
she
had
been
very
stupid
at
college
,
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
.
Mrs
.
Guinea
answered
my
letter
and
invited
me
to
lunch
at
her
home
.
That
was
where
I
saw
my
first
fingerbowl
.
The
water
had
a
few
cherry
blossoms
floating
in
it
,
and
I
thought
it
must
be
some
clear
sort
of
Japanese
after-dinner
soup
and
ate
every
bit
of
it
,
including
the
crisp
little
blossoms
.
Mrs
.
Guinea
never
said
anything
,
and
it
was
only
much
later
,
when
I
told
a
debutante
I
knew
at
college
about
the
dinner
,
that
I
learned
what
I
had
done
.
When
we
came
out
of
the
sunnily
lit
interior
of
the
Ladies
'
Day
offices
,
the
streets
were
gray
and
fuming
with
rain
.
It
was
n't
the
nice
kind
of
rain
that
rinses
you
clean
,
but
the
sort
of
rain
I
imagine
they
must
have
in
Brazil
.
It
flew
straight
down
from
the
sky
in
drops
the
size
of
coffee
saucers
and
hit
the
hot
sidewalks
with
a
hiss
that
sent
clouds
of
steam
writhing
up
from
the
gleaming
,
dark
concrete
.
My
secret
hope
of
spending
the
afternoon
alone
in
Central
Park
died
in
the
glass
eggbeater
of
Ladies
'
Day
's
revolving
doors
.
I
found
myself
spewed
out
through
the
warm
rain
and
into
the
dim
,
throbbing
cave
of
a
cab
,
together
with
Betsy
and
Hilda
and
Emily
Ann
Offenbach
,
a
prim
little
girl
with
a
bun
of
red
hair
and
a
husband
and
three
children
in
Teaneck
,
New
Jersey
.
The
movie
was
very
poor
.
It
starred
a
nice
blonde
girl
who
looked
like
June
Allyson
but
was
really
somebody
else
,
and
a
sexy
black-haired
girl
who
looked
like
Elizabeth
Taylor
but
was
also
somebody
else
,
and
two
big
,
broad-shouldered
bone-heads
with
names
like
Rick
and
Gil
.
It
was
a
football
romance
and
it
was
in
Technicolor
.
I
hate
Technicolor
.
Everybody
in
a
Technicolor
movie
seems
to
feel
obliged
to
wear
a
lurid
costume
in
each
new
scene
and
to
stand
around
like
a
clotheshorse
with
a
lot
of
very
green
trees
or
very
yellow
wheat
or
very
blue
ocean
rolling
away
for
miles
and
miles
in
every
direction
.
Most
of
the
action
in
this
picture
took
place
in
the
football
stands
,
with
the
two
girls
waving
and
cheering
in
smart
suits
with
orange
chrysanthemums
the
size
of
cabbages
on
their
lapels
,
or
in
a
ballroom
,
where
the
girls
swooped
across
the
floor
with
their
dates
,
in
dresses
like
something
out
of
Gone
With
the
Wind
,
and
then
sneaked
off
into
the
powder
room
to
say
nasty
intense
things
to
each
other
.
Finally
I
could
see
the
nice
girl
was
going
to
end
up
with
the
nice
football
hero
and
the
sexy
girl
was
going
to
end
up
with
nobody
,
because
the
man
named
Gil
had
only
wanted
a
mistress
and
not
a
wife
all
along
and
was
now
packing
off
to
Europe
on
a
single
ticket
.
At
about
this
point
I
began
to
feel
peculiar
.
I
looked
round
me
at
all
the
rows
of
rapt
little
heads
with
the
same
silver
glow
on
them
at
the
front
and
the
same
black
shadow
on
them
at
the
back
,
and
they
looked
like
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
lot
of
stupid
moonbrains
.
I
felt
in
terrible
danger
of
puking
.
I
did
n't
know
whether
it
was
the
awful
movie
giving
me
a
stomachache
or
all
that
caviar
I
had
eaten
.
``
I
'm
going
back
to
the
hotel
,
''
I
whispered
to
Betsy
through
the
half-dark
.
Betsy
was
staring
at
the
screen
with
deadly
concentration
.
``
Do
n't
you
feel
good
?
''
she
whispered
,
barely
moving
her
lips
.
``
No
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
feel
like
hell
.
''
``
So
do
I
,
I
'll
come
back
with
you
.
''
We
slipped
out
of
our
seats
and
said
Excuse
me
Excuse
me
Excuse
me
down
the
length
of
our
row
,
while
the
people
grumbled
and
hissed
and
shifted
their
rain
boots
and
umbrellas
to
let
us
pass
,
and
I
stepped
on
as
many
feet
as
I
could
because
it
took
my
mind
off
this
enormous
desire
to
puke
that
was
ballooning
up
in
front
of
me
so
fast
I
could
n't
see
round
it
.
The
remains
of
a
tepid
rain
were
still
sifting
down
when
we
stepped
out
into
the
street
.
Betsy
looked
a
fright
.
The
bloom
was
gone
from
her
cheeks
and
her
drained
face
floated
in
front
of
me
,
green
and
sweating
.
We
fell
into
one
of
those
yellow
checkered
cabs
that
are
always
waiting
at
the
curb
when
you
are
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
you
want
a
taxi
,
and
by
the
time
we
reached
the
hotel
I
had
puked
once
and
Betsy
had
puked
twice
.
The
cab
driver
took
the
corners
with
such
momentum
that
were
thrown
together
first
on
one
side
of
the
back
seat
and
then
on
the
other
.
Each
time
one
of
us
felt
sick
,
she
would
lean
over
quietly
as
if
she
had
dropped
something
and
was
picking
it
up
off
the
floor
,
and
the
other
one
would
hum
a
little
and
pretend
to
be
looking
out
the
window
.
The
cab
driver
seemed
to
know
what
we
were
doing
,
even
so
.
``
Hey
,
''
he
protested
,
driving
through
a
light
that
had
just
turned
red
,
``
you
ca
n't
do
that
in
my
cab
,
you
better
get
out
and
do
it
in
the
street
.
''
But
we
did
n't
say
anything
,
and
I
guess
he
figured
we
were
almost
at
the
hotel
so
he
did
n't
make
us
get
out
until
we
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
main
entrance
.
We
did
n't
dare
wait
to
add
up
the
fare
.
We
stuffed
a
pile
of
silver
into
the
cabby
's
hand
and
dropped
a
couple
of
Kleenexes
to
cover
the
mess
on
the
floor
,
and
ran
in
through
the
lobby
and
on
to
the
empty
elevator
.
Luckily
for
us
,
it
was
a
quiet
time
of
day
.
Betsy
was
sick
again
in
the
elevator
and
I
held
her
head
,
and
then
I
was
sick
and
she
held
mine
.
Usually
after
a
good
puke
you
feel
better
right
away
.
We
hugged
each
other
and
then
said
good-bye
and
went
off
to
opposite
ends
of
the
hall
to
lie
down
in
our
own
rooms
.
There
is
nothing
like
puking
with
somebody
to
make
you
into
old
friends
.
But
the
minute
I
'd
shut
the
door
behind
me
and
undressed
and
dragged
myself
on
to
the
bed
,
I
felt
worse
than
ever
.
I
felt
I
just
had
to
go
to
the
toilet
.
I
struggled
into
my
white
bathrobe
with
the
blue
cornflowers
on
it
and
staggered
down
to
the
bathroom
.
Betsy
was
already
there
.
I
could
hear
her
groaning
behind
the
door
,
so
I
hurried
on
around
the
corner
to
the
bathroom
in
the
next
wing
.
I
thought
I
would
die
,
it
was
so
far
.
I
sat
on
the
toilet
and
leaned
my
head
over
the
edge
of
the
washbowl
and
I
thought
I
was
losing
my
guts
and
my
dinner
both
.
The
sickness
rolled
through
me
in
great
waves
.
After
each
wave
it
would
fade
away
and
leave
me
limp
as
a
wet
leaf
and
shivering
all
over
and
then
I
would
feel
it
rising
up
in
me
again
,
and
the
glittering
white
torture
chamber
tiles
under
my
feet
and
over
my
head
and
on
all
four
sides
closed
in
and
squeezed
me
to
pieces
.
I
do
n't
know
how
long
I
kept
at
it
.
I
let
the
cold
water
in
the
bowl
go
on
running
loudly
with
the
stopper
out
,
so
anybody
who
came
by
would
think
I
was
washing
my
clothes
,
and
then
when
I
felt
reasonably
safe
I
stretched
out
on
the
floor
and
lay
quite
still
.
It
did
n't
seem
to
be
summer
any
more
.
I
could
feel
the
winter
shaking
my
bones
and
banging
my
teeth
together
,
and
the
big
white
hotel
towel
I
had
dragged
down
with
me
lay
under
my
head
numb
as
a
snowdrift
.
I
thought
it
very
bad
manners
for
anyone
to
pound
on
a
bathroom
door
the
way
some
person
was
pounding
.
They
could
just
go
around
the
corner
and
find
another
bathroom
the
way
I
had
done
and
leave
me
in
peace
.
But
the
person
kept
banging
and
pleading
with
me
to
let
them
in
and
I
thought
I
dimly
recognized
the
voice
.
It
sounded
a
bit
like
Emily
Ann
Offenbach
.
``
Just
a
minute
,
''
I
said
then
.
My
words
bungled
out
thick
as
molasses
.
I
pulled
myself
together
and
slowly
rose
and
flushed
the
toilet
for
the
tenth
time
and
sopped
the
bowl
clean
and
rolled
up
the
towel
so
the
vomit
stains
did
n't
show
very
clearly
and
unlocked
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
hall
.
I
knew
it
would
be
fatal
if
I
looked
at
Emily
Ann
or
anybody
else
so
I
fixed
my
eyes
glassily
on
a
window
that
swam
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
put
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
.
The
next
thing
I
had
a
view
of
was
somebody
's
shoe
.
It
was
a
stout
shoe
of
cracked
black
leather
and
quite
old
,
with
tiny
air
holes
in
a
scalloped
pattern
over
the
toe
and
a
dull
polish
,
and
it
was
pointed
at
me
.
It
seemed
to
be
placed
on
a
hard
green
surface
that
was
hurting
my
right
cheekbone
.
I
kept
very
still
,
waiting
for
a
clue
that
would
give
me
some
notion
of
what
to
do
.
A
little
to
the
left
of
the
shoe
I
saw
a
vague
heap
of
blue
cornflowers
on
a
white
ground
and
this
made
me
want
to
cry
.
It
was
the
sleeve
of
my
own
bathrobe
I
was
looking
at
,
and
my
left
hand
lay
pale
as
a
cod
at
the
end
of
it
.
``
She
's
all
right
now
.
''
The
voice
came
from
a
cool
,
rational
region
far
above
my
head
.
For
a
minute
I
did
n't
think
there
was
anything
strange
about
it
,
and
then
I
thought
it
was
strange
.
It
was
a
man
's
voice
,
and
no
men
were
allowed
to
be
in
our
hotel
at
any
time
of
the
night
or
day
.
``
How
many
others
are
there
?
''
the
voice
went
on
.
I
listened
with
interest
.
The
floor
seemed
wonderfully
solid
.
It
was
comforting
to
know
I
had
fallen
and
could
fall
no
farther
.
``
Eleven
,
I
think
,
''
a
woman
's
voice
answered
.
I
figured
she
must
belong
to
the
black
shoe
.
``
I
think
there
's
eleven
more
of
'um
,
but
one
's
missin
'
so
there
's
oney
ten
.
''
``
Well
,
you
get
this
one
to
bed
and
I
'll
take
care
of
the
rest
.
''
I
heard
a
hollow
boomp
boomp
in
my
right
ear
that
grew
fainter
and
fainter
.
Then
a
door
opened
in
the
distance
and
there
were
voices
and
groans
,
and
the
door
shut
again
.
Two
hands
slid
under
my
armpits
and
the
woman
's
voice
said
,
``
Come
,
come
,
lovey
,
we
'll
make
it
yet
,
''
and
I
felt
myself
being
half
lifted
,
and
slowly
the
doors
began
to
move
by
,
one
by
one
,
until
we
came
to
an
open
door
and
went
in
.
The
sheet
on
my
bed
was
folded
back
,
and
the
woman
helped
me
lie
down
and
covered
me
up
to
the
chin
and
rested
for
a
minute
in
the
bedside
armchair
,
fanning
herself
with
one
plump
,
pink
hand
.
She
wore
gilt-rimmed
spectacles
and
a
white
nurse
's
cap
.
``
Who
are
you
?
''
I
asked
in
a
fault
voice
.
``
I
'm
the
hotel
nurse
.
''
``
What
's
the
matter
with
me
?
''
``
Poisoned
,
''
she
said
briefly
.
``
Poisoned
,
the
whole
lot
of
you
.
I
never
seen
anythin
'
like
it
.
Sick
here
,
sick
there
,
whatever
have
you
young
ladies
been
stuffin
'
yourselves
with
?
''
``
Is
everybody
else
sick
too
?
''
I
asked
with
some
hope
.
``
The
whole
of
your
lot
,
''
she
affirmed
with
relish
.
``
Sick
as
dogs
and
cryin
'
for
ma
.
''
The
room
hovered
around
me
with
great
gentleness
,
as
if
the
chairs
and
the
tables
and
the
walls
were
withholding
their
weight
out
of
sympathy
for
my
sudden
frailty
.
``
The
doctor
's
given
you
an
injection
,
''
the
nurse
said
from
the
doorway
.
``
You
'll
sleep
now
.
''
And
the
door
took
her
place
like
a
sheet
of
blank
paper
,
and
then
a
larger
sheet
of
paper
took
the
place
of
the
door
,
and
I
drifted
toward
it
and
smiled
myself
to
sleep
.
Somebody
was
standing
by
my
pillow
with
a
white
cup
.
``
Drink
this
,
''
they
said
.
I
shook
my
head
.
The
pillow
crackled
like
a
wad
of
straw
.
``
Drink
this
and
you
'll
feel
better
.
''
A
thick
white
china
cup
was
lowered
under
my
nose
.
In
the
wan
light
that
might
have
been
evening
and
might
have
been
dawn
I
contemplated
the
clean
amber
liquid
.
Pads
of
butter
floated
on
the
surface
and
a
faint
chickeny
aroma
fumed
up
to
my
nostrils
.
My
eyes
moved
tentatively
to
the
skirt
behind
the
cup
.
``
Betsy
,
''
I
said
.
``
Betsy
nothing
,
it
's
me
.
''
I
raised
my
eyes
then
,
and
saw
Doreen
's
head
silhouetted
against
the
paling
window
,
her
blonde
hair
lit
at
the
tips
from
behind
like
a
halo
of
gold
.
Her
face
was
in
shadow
,
so
I
could
n't
make
out
her
expression
,
but
I
felt
a
sort
of
expert
tenderness
flowing
from
the
ends
of
her
fingers
.
She
might
have
been
Betsy
or
my
mother
or
a
fern-
scented
nurse
.
I
bent
my
head
and
took
a
sip
of
the
broth
.
I
thought
my
mouth
must
be
made
of
sand
.
I
took
another
sip
and
then
another
and
another
until
the
cup
was
empty
.
I
felt
purged
and
holy
and
ready
for
a
new
life
.
Doreen
set
the
cup
on
the
windowsill
and
lowered
herself
into
the
armchair
.
I
noticed
that
she
made
no
move
to
take
out
a
cigarette
,
and
as
she
was
a
chain
smoker
this
surprised
me
.
``
Well
,
you
almost
died
,
''
she
said
finally
.
``
I
guess
it
was
all
that
caviar
.
''
``
Caviar
nothing
!
It
was
the
crabmeat
.
They
did
tests
on
it
and
it
was
chock-full
of
ptomaine
.
''
I
had
a
vision
of
the
celestially
white
kitchens
of
Ladies
'
Day
stretching
into
infinity
.
I
saw
avocado
pear
after
avocado
pear
being
stuffed
with
crabmeat
and
mayonnaise
and
photographed
under
brilliant
lights
.
I
saw
the
delicate
,
pink-mottled
claw
meat
poking
seductively
through
its
blanket
of
mayonnaise
and
the
bland
yellow
pear
cup
with
its
rim
of
alligator-green
cradling
the
whole
mess
.
Poison
.
``
Who
did
tests
?
''
I
thought
the
doctor
might
have
pumped
somebody
's
stomach
and
then
analyzed
what
he
found
in
his
hotel
laboratory
.
``
Those
dodos
on
Ladies
'
Day
.
As
soon
as
you
all
started
keeling
over
like
ninepins
somebody
called
into
the
office
and
the
office
called
across
to
Ladies
'
Day
and
they
did
tests
on
everything
left
over
from
the
big
lunch
.
Ha
!
''
``
Ha
!
''
I
echoed
hollowly
.
It
was
good
to
have
Doreen
back
.
``
They
sent
presents
,
''
she
added
.
``
They
're
in
a
big
carton
out
in
the
hall
.
''
``
How
did
they
get
here
so
fast
?
''
``
Special
express
delivery
,
what
do
you
think
?
They
ca
n't
afford
to
have
the
lot
of
you
running
around
saying
you
got
poisoned
at
Ladies
'
Day
.
You
could
sue
them
for
every
penny
they
own
if
you
just
knew
some
smart
law
man
.
''
``
What
are
the
presents
?
''
I
began
to
feel
if
it
was
a
good
enough
present
I
would
n't
mind
about
what
happened
,
because
I
felt
so
pure
as
a
result
.
``
Nobody
's
opened
the
box
yet
,
they
're
all
out
flat
.
I
'm
supposed
to
be
carting
soup
in
to
everybody
,
seeing
as
I
'm
the
only
one
on
my
feet
,
but
I
brought
you
yours
first
.
''
``
See
what
the
present
is
,
''
I
begged
.
Then
I
remembered
and
said
,
``
I
've
a
present
for
you
as
well
.
''
Doreen
went
out
into
the
hall
.
I
could
hear
her
rustling
around
for
a
minute
and
then
the
sound
of
paper
tearing
.
Finally
she
came
back
carrying
a
thick
book
with
a
glossy
cover
and
people
's
names
printed
all
over
it
.
``
The
Thirty
Best
Short
Stories
of
the
Year
.
''
She
dropped
the
book
in
my
lap
.
``
There
's
eleven
more
of
them
out
there
in
that
box
.
I
suppose
they
thought
it
'd
give
you
something
to
read
while
you
were
sick
.
''
She
paused
.
``
Where
's
mine
?
''
I
fished
in
my
pocketbook
and
handed
Doreen
the
mirror
with
her
name
and
the
daisies
on
it
.
Doreen
looked
at
me
and
I
looked
at
her
and
we
both
burst
out
laughing
.
``
You
can
have
my
soup
if
you
want
,
''
she
said
.
``
They
put
twelve
soups
on
the
tray
by
mistake
and
Lenny
and
I
stuffed
down
so
many
hotdogs
while
we
were
waiting
for
the
rain
to
stop
I
could
n't
eat
another
mouthful
.
''
``
Bring
it
in
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
'm
starving
.
''
Five
AT
SEVEN
THE
NEXT
MORNING
the
telephone
rang
.
Slowly
I
swam
up
from
the
bottom
of
a
black
sleep
.
I
already
had
a
telegram
from
Jay
Cee
stuck
in
my
mirror
,
telling
me
not
to
bother
to
come
in
to
work
but
to
rest
for
a
day
and
get
completely
well
,
and
how
sorry
she
was
about
the
bad
crabmeat
,
so
I
could
n't
imagine
who
would
be
calling
.
I
reached
out
and
hitched
the
receiver
onto
my
pillow
so
the
mouthpiece
rested
on
my
collarbone
and
the
earpiece
lay
on
my
shoulder
.
``
Hello
?
''
A
man
's
voice
said
,
``
Is
that
Miss
Esther
Greenwood
?
''
I
thought
I
detected
a
slight
foreign
accent
.
``
It
certainly
is
,
''
I
said
.
``
This
is
Constantin
Something-or-Other
.
''
I
could
n't
make
out
the
last
name
,
but
it
was
full
of
S
's
and
K
's
.
I
did
n't
know
any
Constantin
,
but
I
had
n't
the
heart
to
say
so
.
Then
I
remembered
Mrs.
Willard
and
her
simultaneous
interpreter
.
``
Of
course
,
of
course
!
''
I
cried
,
sitting
up
and
clutching
the
phone
to
me
with
both
hands
.
I
'd
never
have
given
Mrs.
Willard
credit
for
introducing
me
to
a
man
named
Constantin
.
I
collected
men
with
interesting
names
.
I
already
knew
a
Socrates
.
He
was
tall
and
ugly
and
intellectual
and
the
son
of
some
big
Greek
movie
producer
in
Hollywood
,
but
also
a
Catholic
,
which
ruined
it
for
both
of
us
.
In
addition
to
Socrates
,
I
knew
a
White
Russian
named
Attila
at
the
Boston
School
of
Business
Administration
.
Gradually
I
realized
that
Constantin
was
trying
to
arrange
a
meeting
for
us
later
in
the
day
.
``
Would
you
like
to
see
the
UN
this
afternoon
?
''
``
I
can
already
see
the
UN
,
''
I
told
him
,
with
a
little
hysterical
giggle
.
He
seemed
nonplussed
.
``
I
can
see
it
from
my
window
.
''
I
thought
perhaps
my
English
was
a
touch
too
fast
for
him
.
There
was
a
silence
.
Then
he
said
,
``
Maybe
you
would
like
a
bite
to
eat
afterward
.
''
I
detected
the
vocabulary
of
Mrs.
Willard
and
my
heart
sank
.
Mrs.
Willard
always
invited
you
for
a
bite
to
eat
.
I
remembered
that
this
man
had
been
a
guest
at
Mrs.
Willard
's
house
when
he
first
came
to
America
--
Mrs.
Willard
had
one
of
these
arrangements
where
you
open
your
house
to
foreigners
and
then
when
you
go
abroad
they
open
their
houses
to
you
.
I
now
saw
quite
clearly
that
Mrs.
Willard
had
simply
traded
her
open
house
in
Russia
for
my
bite
to
eat
in
New
York
.
``
Yes
,
I
would
like
a
bite
to
eat
,
''
I
said
stiffly
.
``
What
time
will
you
come
?
''
``
I
'll
call
for
you
in
my
car
about
two
.
It
's
the
Amazon
,
is
n't
it
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
``
Ah
,
I
know
where
that
is
.
''
For
a
moment
I
thought
his
tone
was
laden
with
special
meaning
,
and
then
I
figured
that
probably
some
of
the
girls
at
the
Amazon
were
secretaries
at
the
UN
and
maybe
he
had
taken
one
of
them
out
at
one
time
.
I
let
him
hang
up
first
,
and
then
I
hung
up
and
lay
back
in
the
pillows
,
feeling
grim
.
There
I
went
again
,
building
up
a
glamorous
picture
of
a
man
who
would
love
me
passionately
the
minute
he
met
me
,
and
all
out
of
a
few
prosy
nothings
.
A
duty
tour
of
the
UN
and
a
post-UN
sandwich
!
I
tried
to
jack
up
my
morale
.
Probably
Mrs.
Willard
's
simultaneous
interpreter
would
be
short
and
ugly
and
I
would
come
to
look
down
on
him
in
the
end
the
way
I
looked
down
on
Buddy
Willard
.
This
thought
gave
me
a
certain
satisfaction
.
Because
I
did
look
down
on
Buddy
Willard
,
and
although
everybody
still
thought
I
would
marry
him
when
he
came
out
of
the
TB
place
,
I
knew
I
would
never
marry
him
if
he
were
the
last
man
on
earth
.
Buddy
Willard
was
a
hypocrite
.
Of
course
,
I
did
n't
know
he
was
a
hypocrite
at
first
.
I
thought
he
was
the
most
wonderful
boy
I
'd
ever
seen
.
I
'd
adored
him
from
a
distance
for
five
years
before
he
even
looked
at
me
,
and
then
there
was
a
beautiful
time
when
I
still
adored
him
and
he
started
looking
at
me
,
and
then
just
as
he
was
looking
at
me
more
and
more
I
discovered
quite
by
accident
what
an
awful
hypocrite
he
was
,
and
now
he
wanted
me
to
marry
him
and
I
hated
his
guts
.
The
worst
part
of
it
was
I
could
n't
come
straight
out
and
tell
him
what
I
thought
of
him
,
because
he
caught
TB
before
I
could
do
that
,
and
now
I
had
to
humor
him
along
till
he
got
well
again
and
could
take
the
unvarnished
truth
.
I
decided
not
to
go
down
to
the
cafeteria
for
breakfast
.
It
would
only
mean
getting
dressed
,
and
what
was
the
point
of
getting
dressed
if
you
were
staying
in
bed
for
the
morning
?
I
could
have
called
down
and
asked
for
a
breakfast
tray
in
my
room
,
I
guess
,
but
then
I
would
have
to
tip
the
person
who
brought
it
up
and
I
never
knew
how
much
to
tip
.
I
'd
had
some
very
upsetting
experiences
trying
to
tip
people
in
New
York
.
When
I
first
arrived
at
the
Amazon
a
dwarfish
,
bald
man
in
a
bellhop
's
uniform
carried
my
suitcase
up
in
the
elevator
and
unlocked
my
room
for
me
.
Of
course
I
rushed
immediately
to
the
window
and
looked
out
to
see
what
the
view
was
.
After
a
while
I
was
aware
of
this
bellhop
turning
on
the
hot
and
cold
taps
in
the
washbowl
and
saying
``
This
is
the
hot
and
this
is
the
cold
''
and
switching
on
the
radio
and
telling
me
all
the
names
of
all
the
New
York
stations
and
I
began
to
get
uneasy
,
so
I
kept
my
back
to
him
and
said
firmly
,
``
Thank
you
for
bringing
up
my
suitcase
.
''
``
Thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
.
Ha
!
''
he
said
in
a
very
nasty
insinuating
tone
,
and
before
I
could
wheel
round
to
see
what
had
come
over
him
he
was
gone
,
shutting
the
door
behind
him
with
a
rude
slam
.
Later
,
when
I
told
Doreen
about
his
curious
behavior
,
ske
said
,
``
You
ninny
,
he
wanted
his
tip
.
''
I
asked
how
much
I
should
have
given
and
she
said
a
quarter
at
least
and
thirty-
five
cents
if
the
suitcase
was
too
heavy
.
Now
I
could
have
carried
that
suitcase
to
my
room
perfectly
well
by
myself
,
only
the
bellhop
seemed
so
eager
to
do
it
that
I
let
him
.
I
thought
that
sort
of
service
came
along
with
what
you
paid
for
your
hotel
room
.
I
hate
handing
over
money
to
people
for
doing
what
I
could
just
as
easily
do
myself
,
it
makes
me
nervous
.
Doreen
said
ten
per
cent
was
what
you
should
tip
a
person
,
but
I
somehow
never
had
the
right
change
and
I
'd
have
felt
awfully
silly
giving
somebody
half
a
dollar
and
saying
,
``
Fifteen
cents
of
this
is
a
tip
for
you
,
please
give
me
thirty-five
cents
back
.
''
The
first
time
I
took
a
taxi
in
New
York
I
tipped
the
driver
ten
cents
.
The
fare
was
a
dollar
,
so
I
thought
ten
cents
was
exactly
right
and
gave
the
driver
my
dime
with
a
little
flourish
and
a
smile
.
But
he
only
held
it
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
stared
and
stared
at
it
,
and
when
I
stepped
out
of
the
cab
,
hoping
I
had
not
handed
him
a
Canadian
dime
by
mistake
,
he
started
yelling
,
``
Lady
,
I
got
ta
live
like
you
and
everybody
else
,
''
in
a
loud
voice
which
scared
me
so
much
I
broke
into
a
run
.
Luckily
he
was
stopped
at
a
traffic
light
or
I
think
he
would
have
driven
along
beside
me
yelling
in
that
embarrassing
way
.
When
I
asked
Doreen
about
this
she
said
the
tipping
percentage
might
well
have
risen
from
ten
to
fifteen
per
cent
since
she
was
last
in
New
York
.
Either
that
,
or
that
particular
cabdriver
was
an
out-and-out
louse
.
I
reached
for
the
book
the
people
from
Ladies
'
Day
had
sent
.
When
I
opened
it
a
card
fell
out
.
The
front
of
the
card
showed
a
poodle
in
a
flowered
bedjacket
sitting
in
a
poodle
basket
with
a
sad
face
,
and
the
inside
of
the
card
showed
the
poodle
lying
down
in
the
basket
with
a
smile
,
sound
asleep
under
an
embroidered
sampler
that
said
,
``
You
'll
get
well
best
with
lots
and
lots
of
rest
.
''
At
the
bottom
of
the
card
somebody
had
written
,
``
Get
well
quick
!
from
all
of
your
good
friends
at
Ladies
'
Day
,
''
in
lavender
ink
.
I
flipped
through
one
story
after
another
until
finally
I
came
to
a
story
about
a
fig
tree
.
This
fig
grew
on
a
green
lawn
between
the
house
of
a
Jewish
man
and
a
convent
,
and
the
Jewish
man
and
a
beautiful
dark
nun
kept
meeting
at
the
tree
to
pick
the
ripe
figs
,
until
one
day
they
saw
an
egg
hatching
in
a
bird
's
nest
on
a
branch
of
the
tree
,
and
as
they
watched
the
little
bird
peck
its
way
out
of
the
egg
,
they
touched
the
backs
of
their
hands
together
,
and
then
the
nun
did
n't
come
out
to
pick
figs
with
the
Jewish
man
any
more
but
a
mean-faced
Catholic
kitchen
maid
came
to
pick
them
instead
and
counted
up
the
figs
the
man
picked
after
they
were
both
through
to
be
sure
he
had
n't
picked
any
more
than
she
had
,
and
the
man
was
furious
.
I
thought
it
was
a
lovely
story
,
especially
the
part
about
the
fig
tree
in
winter
under
the
snow
and
then
the
fig
tree
in
spring
with
all
the
green
fruit
.
I
felt
sorry
when
I
came
to
the
last
page
.
I
wanted
to
crawl
in
between
those
black
lines
of
print
the
way
you
crawl
through
a
fence
,
and
go
to
sleep
under
that
beautiful
big
green
fig
tree
.
It
seemed
to
me
Buddy
Willard
and
I
were
like
that
Jewish
man
and
that
nun
,
although
of
course
we
were
n't
Jewish
or
Catholic
but
Unitarian
.
We
had
met
together
under
our
own
imaginary
fig
tree
,
and
what
we
had
seen
was
n't
a
bird
coming
out
of
an
egg
but
a
baby
coming
out
of
a
woman
,
and
then
something
awful
happened
and
we
went
our
separate
ways
.
As
I
lay
there
in
my
white
hotel
bed
feeling
lonely
and
weak
,
I
thought
I
was
up
in
that
sanatorium
in
the
Adirondacks
,
and
I
felt
like
a
heel
of
the
worst
sort
.
In
his
letters
Buddy
kept
telling
me
how
he
was
reading
poems
by
a
poet
who
was
also
a
doctor
and
how
he
'd
found
out
about
some
famous
dead
Russian
short-story
writer
who
had
been
a
doctor
too
,
so
maybe
doctors
and
writers
could
get
along
fine
after
all
Now
this
was
a
very
different
tune
from
what
Buddy
Willard
had
been
singing
all
the
two
years
we
were
getting
to
know
each
other
.
I
remember
the
day
he
smiled
at
me
and
said
,
``
Do
you
know
what
a
poem
is
,
Esther
?
''
``
No
,
what
?
''
I
said
.
``
A
piece
of
dust
.
''
And
he
looked
so
proud
of
having
thought
of
this
that
I
just
stared
at
his
blond
hair
and
his
blue
eyes
and
his
white
teeth
--
he
had
very
long
,
strong
teeth
--
and
said
,
``
I
guess
so
.
''
It
was
only
in
the
middle
of
New
York
a
whole
year
later
that
I
finally
thought
of
an
answer
to
that
remark
.
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
having
imaginary
conversations
with
Buddy
Willard
.
He
was
a
couple
of
years
older
than
I
was
and
very
scientific
,
so
he
could
always
prove
things
.
When
I
was
with
him
I
had
to
work
to
keep
my
head
above
water
.
These
conversations
I
had
in
my
mind
usually
repeated
the
beginnings
of
conversations
I
'd
really
had
with
Buddy
,
only
they
finished
with
me
answering
him
back
quite
sharply
,
instead
of
just
sitting
around
and
saying
,
``
I
guess
so
.
''
Now
,
lying
on
my
back
in
bed
,
I
imagined
Buddy
saying
,
``
Do
you
know
what
a
poem
is
,
Esther
?
''
``
No
,
what
?
''
I
would
say
.
``
A
piece
of
dust
.
''
Then
just
as
he
was
smiling
and
starting
to
look
proud
,
I
would
say
,
``
So
are
the
cadavers
you
cut
up
.
So
are
the
people
you
think
you
're
curing
.
They
're
dust
as
dust
as
dust
.
I
reckon
a
good
poem
lasts
a
whole
lot
longer
than
a
hundred
of
those
people
put
together
.
''
And
of
course
Buddy
would
n't
have
any
answer
to
that
,
because
what
I
said
was
true
.
People
were
made
of
nothing
so
much
as
dust
,
and
I
could
n't
see
that
doctoring
all
that
dust
was
a
bit
better
than
writing
poems
people
would
remember
and
repeat
to
themselves
when
they
were
unhappy
or
sick
and
could
n't
sleep
.
My
trouble
was
I
took
everything
Buddy
Willard
told
me
as
the
honest-to-God
truth
.
I
remember
the
first
night
he
kissed
me
.
It
was
after
the
Yale
Junior
Prom
.
It
was
strange
,
the
way
Buddy
had
invited
me
to
that
prom
.
He
popped
into
my
house
out
of
the
blue
one
Christmas
vacation
,
wearing
a
thick
white
turtleneck
sweater
and
looking
so
handsome
I
could
hardly
stop
staring
,
and
said
,
``
I
might
drop
over
to
see
you
at
college
some
day
,
all
right
?
''
I
was
flabbergasted
.
I
only
saw
Buddy
at
church
on
Sundays
when
we
were
both
home
from
college
,
and
then
at
a
distance
,
and
I
could
n't
figure
what
had
put
it
into
his
head
to
run
over
and
see
me
--
he
had
run
the
two
miles
between
our
houses
for
cross-
country
practice
,
he
said
.
Of
course
,
our
mothers
were
good
friends
.
They
had
gone
to
school
together
and
then
both
married
their
professors
and
settled
down
in
the
same
town
,
but
Buddy
was
always
off
on
a
scholarship
at
prep
school
in
the
fall
or
earning
money
by
fighting
blister
rust
in
Montana
in
the
summer
,
so
our
mothers
being
old
school
chums
really
did
n't
matter
a
bit
.
After
this
sudden
visit
I
did
n't
hear
a
word
from
Buddy
until
one
fine
Saturday
morning
in
early
March
.
I
was
up
in
my
room
at
college
,
studying
about
Peter
the
Hermit
and
Walter
the
Penniless
for
my
history
exam
on
the
crusades
the
coming
Monday
,
when
the
hall
phone
rang
.
Usually
people
are
supposed
to
take
turns
answering
the
hall
phone
,
but
as
I
was
the
only
freshman
on
a
floor
with
all
seniors
they
made
me
answer
it
most
of
the
time
.
I
waited
a
minute
to
see
if
anybody
would
beat
me
to
it
.
Then
I
figured
everybody
was
probably
out
playing
squash
or
away
on
weekends
,
so
I
answered
it
myself
.
``
Is
that
you
,
Esther
?
''
the
girl
on
watch
downstairs
said
,
and
when
I
said
yes
,
she
said
,
``
There
's
a
man
to
see
you
.
''
I
was
surprised
to
hear
this
,
because
of
all
the
blind
dates
I
'd
had
that
year
not
one
called
me
up
again
for
a
second
date
.
I
just
did
n't
have
any
luck
.
I
hated
coming
downstairs
sweaty-handed
and
curious
every
Saturday
night
and
having
some
senior
introduce
me
to
her
aunt
's
best
friend
's
son
and
finding
some
pale
,
mushroomy
fellow
with
protruding
ears
or
buck
teeth
or
a
bad
leg
.
I
did
n't
think
I
deserved
it
.
After
all
,
I
was
n't
crippled
in
any
way
,
I
just
studied
too
hard
,
I
did
n't
know
when
to
stop
.
Well
,
I
combed
my
hair
and
put
on
some
more
lipstick
and
took
my
history
book
-
-
so
I
could
say
I
was
on
my
way
to
the
library
if
it
turned
out
to
be
somebody
awful
--
and
went
down
,
and
there
was
Buddy
Willard
leaning
against
the
mail
table
in
a
khaki
zipper
jacket
and
blue
dungarees
and
frayed
gray
sneakers
and
grinning
up
at
me
.
``
I
just
came
over
to
say
hello
,
''
he
said
.
I
thought
it
odd
he
should
come
all
the
way
up
from
Yale
even
hitchhiking
,
as
he
did
,
to
save
money
,
just
to
say
hello
.
``
Hello
,
''
I
said
.
``
Let
's
go
out
and
sit
on
the
porch
.
''
I
wanted
to
go
out
on
the
porch
because
the
girl
on
watch
was
a
nosy
senior
and
eyeing
me
curiously
.
She
obviously
thought
Buddy
had
made
a
big
mistake
.
We
sat
side
by
side
in
two
wicker
rocking
chairs
.
The
sunlight
was
clean
and
windless
and
almost
hot
.
``
I
ca
n't
stay
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
,
''
Buddy
said
.
``
Oh
,
come
on
,
stay
for
lunch
,
''
I
said
.
``
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
do
that
.
I
'm
up
here
for
the
Sophomore
Prom
with
Joan
.
''
I
felt
like
a
prize
idiot
.
``
How
is
Joan
?
''
I
asked
coldly
.
Joan
Gilling
came
from
our
home
town
and
went
to
our
church
and
was
a
year
ahead
of
me
at
college
.
She
was
a
big
wheel-president
of
her
class
and
a
physics
major
and
the
college
hockey
champion
.
She
always
made
me
feel
squirmy
with
her
starey
pebble-colored
eyes
and
her
gleaming
tombstone
teeth
and
her
breathy
voice
.
She
was
big
as
a
horse
,
too
.
I
began
to
think
Buddy
had
pretty
poor
taste
.
``
Oh
,
Joan
,
''
he
said
.
``
She
asked
me
up
to
this
dance
two
months
ahead
of
time
and
her
mother
asked
my
mother
if
I
would
take
her
,
so
what
could
I
do
?
''
``
Well
,
why
did
you
say
you
'd
take
her
if
you
did
n't
want
to
?
''
I
asked
meanly
.
``
Oh
,
I
like
Joan
.
She
never
cares
whether
you
spend
any
money
on
her
or
not
and
she
enjoys
doing
things
out-of-doors
.
The
last
time
she
came
down
to
Yale
for
house
weekend
we
went
on
a
bicycle
trip
to
East
Rock
and
she
's
the
only
girl
I
have
n't
had
to
push
up
hills
.
Joan
's
all
right
.
''
I
went
cold
with
envy
.
I
had
never
been
to
Yale
,
and
Yale
was
the
place
all
the
seniors
in
my
house
liked
to
go
best
on
weekends
.
I
decided
to
expect
nothing
from
Buddy
Willard
.
If
you
expect
nothing
from
somebody
you
are
never
disappointed
.
``
You
better
go
and
find
Joan
then
,
''
I
said
in
a
matter-of-fact
voice
.
``
I
've
a
date
coming
any
minute
and
he
wo
n't
like
seeing
me
sitting
around
with
you
.
''
``
A
date
?
''
Buddy
looked
surprised
.
``
Who
is
it
?
''
``
It
's
two
,
''
I
said
,
``
Peter
the
Hermit
and
Walter
the
Penniless
.
''
Buddy
did
n't
say
anything
,
so
I
said
,
``
Those
are
their
nicknames
.
''
Then
I
added
,
``
They
're
from
Dartmouth
.
''
I
guess
Buddy
never
read
much
history
,
because
his
mouth
stiffened
.
He
swung
up
from
the
wicker
rocking
chair
and
gave
it
a
sharp
little
unnecessary
push
.
Then
he
dropped
a
pale
blue
envelope
with
a
Yale
crest
into
my
lap
.
``
Here
's
a
letter
I
meant
to
leave
for
you
if
you
were
n't
in
.
There
's
a
question
in
it
you
can
answer
by
mail
.
I
do
n't
feel
like
asking
you
about
it
right
now
.
''
After
Buddy
had
gone
I
opened
the
letter
.
It
was
a
letter
inviting
me
to
the
Yale
Junior
Prom
.
I
was
so
surprised
I
let
out
a
couple
of
yips
and
ran
into
the
house
shouting
,
``
I
'm
going
I
'm
going
I
'm
going
.
''
After
the
bright
white
sun
on
the
porch
it
looked
pitch
dark
in
there
,
and
I
could
n't
make
out
a
thing
.
I
found
myself
hugging
the
senior
on
watch
.
When
she
heard
I
was
going
to
the
Yale
Junior
Prom
she
treated
me
with
amazement
and
respect
.
Oddly
enough
,
things
changed
in
the
house
after
that
.
The
seniors
on
my
floor
started
speaking
to
me
and
every
now
and
then
one
of
them
would
answer
the
phone
quite
spontaneously
and
nobody
made
any
more
nasty
loud
remarks
outside
my
door
about
people
wasting
their
golden
college
days
with
their
noses
stuck
in
a
book
.
Well
,
all
during
the
Junior
Prom
Buddy
treated
me
like
a
friend
or
a
cousin
.
We
danced
about
a
mile
apart
the
whole
time
,
until
during
``
Auld
Lang
Syne
''
he
suddenly
rested
his
chin
on
the
tip
of
my
head
as
if
he
were
very
tired
.
Then
in
the
cold
,
black
,
three-o'clock
wind
we
walked
very
slowly
the
five
miles
back
to
the
house
where
I
was
sleeping
in
the
living
room
on
a
couch
that
was
too
short
because
it
only
cost
fifty
cents
a
night
instead
of
two
dollars
like
most
of
the
other
places
with
proper
beds
.
I
felt
dull
and
flat
and
full
of
shattered
visions
.
I
had
imagined
Buddy
would
fall
in
love
with
me
that
weekend
and
that
I
would
n't
have
to
worry
about
what
I
was
doing
on
any
more
Saturday
nights
the
rest
of
the
year
.
Just
as
we
approached
the
house
where
I
was
staying
Buddy
said
,
``
Let
's
go
up
to
the
chemistry
lab
.
''
I
was
aghast
.
``
The
chemistry
lab
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
Buddy
reached
for
my
hand
.
``
There
's
a
beautiful
view
up
there
behind
the
chemistry
lab
.
''
And
sure
enough
,
there
was
a
sort
of
hilly
place
behind
the
chemistry
lab
from
which
you
could
see
the
lights
of
a
couple
of
houses
in
New
Haven
.
I
stood
pretending
to
admire
them
while
Buddy
got
a
good
footing
on
the
rough
soil
.
While
he
kissed
me
I
kept
my
eyes
open
and
tried
to
memorize
the
spacing
of
the
house
lights
so
I
would
never
forget
them
.
Finally
Buddy
stepped
back
.
``
Wow
!
''
he
said
.
``
Wow
what
?
''
I
said
,
surprised
.
It
had
been
a
dry
,
uninspiring
little
kiss
,
and
I
remember
thinking
it
was
too
bad
both
our
mouths
were
so
chapped
from
walking
five
miles
in
that
cold
wind
.
``
Wow
,
it
makes
me
feel
terrific
to
kiss
you
.
''
I
modestly
did
n't
say
anything
.
``
I
guess
you
go
out
with
a
lot
of
boys
,
''
Buddy
said
then
.
``
Well
,
I
guess
I
do
.
''
I
thought
I
must
have
gone
out
with
a
different
boy
for
every
week
in
the
year
.
``
Well
,
I
have
to
study
a
lot
.
''
``
So
do
I
,
''
I
put
in
hastily
.
``
I
have
to
keep
my
scholarship
after
all
.
''
``
Still
,
I
think
I
could
manage
to
see
you
every
third
weekend
.
''
``
That
's
nice
.
''
I
was
almost
fainting
and
dying
to
get
back
to
college
and
tell
everybody
.
Buddy
kissed
me
again
in
front
of
the
house
steps
,
and
the
next
fall
,
when
his
scholarship
to
medical
school
came
through
,
I
went
there
to
see
him
instead
of
to
Yale
and
it
was
there
I
found
out
how
he
had
fooled
me
all
those
years
and
what
a
hypocrite
he
was
.
I
found
out
on
the
day
we
saw
the
baby
born
.
Six
I
had
KEPT
BEGGING
Buddy
to
show
me
some
really
interesting
hospital
sights
,
so
one
Friday
I
cut
all
my
classes
and
came
down
for
a
long
weekend
and
he
gave
me
the
works
.
I
started
out
by
dressing
in
a
white
coat
and
sitting
on
a
tall
stool
in
a
room
with
four
cadavers
,
while
Buddy
and
his
friends
cut
them
up
.
These
cadavers
were
so
unhuman-looking
they
did
n't
bother
me
a
bit
.
They
had
stiff
,
leathery
,
purple-black
skin
and
they
smelt
like
old
pickle
jars
.
After
that
,
Buddy
took
me
out
into
the
hall
where
they
had
some
big
glass
bottles
full
of
babies
that
had
died
before
they
were
born
.
The
baby
in
the
first
bottle
had
a
large
white
head
bent
over
a
tiny
curled-up
body
the
size
of
a
frog
.
The
baby
in
the
next
bottle
was
bigger
and
the
baby
next
to
that
one
was
bigger
still
and
the
baby
in
the
last
bottle
was
the
size
of
a
normal
baby
and
he
seemed
to
be
looking
at
me
and
smiling
a
little
piggy
smile
.
I
was
quite
proud
of
the
calm
way
I
stared
at
all
these
gruesome
things
.
The
only
time
I
jumped
was
when
I
leaned
my
elbow
on
Buddy
's
cadaver
's
somach
to
watch
him
dissect
a
lung
.
After
a
minute
or
two
I
felt
this
burning
sensation
in
my
elbow
and
it
occurred
to
me
the
cadaver
might
just
be
half
alive
since
it
was
still
warm
,
so
I
leapt
off
my
stool
with
a
small
exclamation
.
Then
Buddy
explained
the
burning
was
only
from
the
pickling
fluid
,
and
I
sat
back
in
my
old
position
.
In
the
hour
before
lunch
Buddy
took
me
to
a
lecture
on
sickle-cell
anemia
and
some
other
depressing
diseases
,
where
they
wheeled
sick
people
out
onto
the
platform
and
asked
them
questions
and
then
wheeled
them
off
and
showed
colored
slides
.
One
slide
I
remember
showed
a
beautiful
laughing
girl
with
a
black
mole
on
her
cheek
.
``
Twenty
days
after
that
mole
appeared
the
girl
was
dead
,
''
the
doctor
said
,
and
everybody
went
very
quiet
for
a
minute
and
then
the
bell
rang
,
so
I
never
really
found
out
what
the
mole
was
or
why
the
girl
died
.
In
the
afternoon
we
went
to
see
a
baby
born
.
First
we
found
a
linen
closet
in
the
hospital
corridor
where
Buddy
took
out
a
white
mask
for
me
to
wear
and
some
gauze
.
A
tall
fat
medical
student
,
big
as
Sydney
Greenstreet
,
lounged
nearby
,
watching
Buddy
wind
the
gauze
round
and
round
my
head
until
my
hair
was
completely
covered
and
only
my
eyes
peered
out
over
the
white
mask
.
The
medical
student
gave
an
unpleasant
little
snicker
.
``
At
least
your
mother
loves
you
,
''
he
said
.
I
was
so
busy
thinking
how
very
fat
he
was
and
how
unfortunate
it
must
be
for
a
man
and
especially
a
young
man
to
be
fat
,
because
what
woman
could
stand
leaning
over
that
big
stomach
to
kiss
him
,
that
I
did
n't
immediately
realize
what
this
student
had
said
to
me
was
an
insult
.
By
the
time
I
figured
he
must
consider
himself
quite
a
fine
fellow
and
had
thought
up
a
cutting
remark
about
how
only
a
mother
loves
a
fat
man
,
he
was
gone
.
Buddy
was
examining
a
queer
wooden
plaque
on
the
wall
with
a
row
of
holes
in
it
,
starting
from
a
hole
about
the
size
of
a
silver
dollar
and
ending
with
one
the
size
of
a
dinner
plate
.
``
Fine
,
fine
,
''
he
said
to
me
.
``
There
's
somebody
about
to
have
a
baby
this
minute
.
''
At
the
door
of
the
delivery
room
stood
a
thin
,
stoop-shouldered
medical
student
Buddy
knew
.
``
Hello
,
Will
,
''
Buddy
said
.
``
Who
's
on
the
job
?
''
``
I
am
,
''
Will
said
gloomily
,
and
I
noticed
little
drops
of
sweat
beading
his
high
pale
forehead
.
``
I
am
,
and
it
's
my
first
.
''
Buddy
told
me
Will
was
a
third-year
man
and
had
to
deliver
eight
babies
before
he
could
graduate
.
Then
he
noticed
a
bustle
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
and
some
men
in
lime-green
coats
and
skull
caps
and
a
few
nurses
came
moving
toward
us
in
a
ragged
procession
wheeling
a
trolley
with
a
big
white
lump
on
it
.
``
You
ought
n't
to
see
this
,
''
Will
muttered
in
my
ear
.
``
You
'll
never
want
to
have
a
baby
if
you
do
.
They
ought
n't
to
let
women
watch
.
It
'll
be
the
end
of
the
human
race
.
''
Buddy
and
I
laughed
,
and
then
Buddy
shook
Will
's
hand
and
we
all
went
into
the
room
.
I
was
so
struck
by
the
sight
of
the
table
where
they
were
lifting
the
woman
I
did
n't
say
a
word
.
It
looked
like
some
awful
torture
table
,
with
these
metal
stirrups
sticking
up
in
mid-air
at
one
end
and
all
sorts
of
instruments
and
wires
and
tubes
I
could
n't
make
out
properly
at
the
other
.
Buddy
and
I
stood
together
by
the
window
,
a
few
feet
away
from
the
woman
,
where
we
had
a
perfect
view
.
The
woman
's
stomach
stuck
up
so
high
I
could
n't
see
her
face
or
the
upper
part
of
her
body
at
all
.
She
seemed
to
have
nothing
but
an
enormous
spider-fat
stomach
and
two
little
ugly
spindly
legs
propped
in
the
high
stirrups
,
and
all
the
time
the
baby
was
being
born
she
never
stopped
making
this
unhuman
whooing
noise
.
Later
Buddy
told
me
the
woman
was
on
a
drug
that
would
make
her
forget
she
'd
had
any
pain
and
that
when
she
swore
and
groaned
she
really
did
n't
know
what
she
was
doing
because
she
was
in
a
kind
of
twilight
sleep
.
I
thought
it
sounded
just
like
the
sort
of
drug
a
man
would
invent
.
Here
was
a
woman
in
terrible
pain
,
obviously
feeling
every
bit
of
it
or
she
would
n't
groan
like
that
,
and
she
would
go
straight
home
and
start
another
baby
,
because
the
drug
would
make
her
forget
how
bad
the
pain
had
been
,
when
all
the
time
,
in
some
secret
part
of
her
,
that
long
,
blind
,
doorless
and
windowless
corridor
of
pain
was
waiting
to
open
up
and
shut
her
in
again
.
The
head
doctor
,
who
was
supervising
Will
,
kept
saying
to
the
woman
,
``
Push
down
,
Mrs.
Tomolillo
,
push
down
,
that
's
a
good
girl
,
push
down
,
''
and
finally
through
the
split
,
shaven
place
between
her
legs
,
lurid
with
disinfectant
,
I
saw
a
dark
fuzzy
thing
appear
.
``
The
baby
's
head
,
''
Buddy
whispered
under
cover
of
the
woman
's
groans
.
But
the
baby
's
head
stuck
for
some
reason
,
and
the
doctor
told
Will
he
'd
have
to
make
a
cut
.
I
heard
the
scissors
close
on
the
woman
's
skin
like
cloth
and
the
blood
began
to
run
down
--
a
fierce
,
bright
red
.
Then
all
at
once
the
baby
seemed
to
pop
out
into
Will
's
hands
,
the
color
of
a
blue
pluto
and
floured
with
white
stuff
and
streaked
with
blood
,
and
Will
kept
saying
,
``
I
'm
going
to
drop
it
,
I
'm
going
to
drop
it
,
I
'm
going
to
drop
it
,
''
in
a
terrified
voice
.
``
No
,
you
're
not
,
''
the
doctor
said
,
and
took
the
baby
out
of
Will
's
hands
and
started
massaging
it
,
and
the
blue
color
went
away
and
the
baby
started
to
cry
in
a
torn
,
croaky
voice
and
I
could
see
it
was
a
boy
.
The
first
thing
that
baby
did
was
pee
in
the
doctor
's
face
.
I
told
Buddy
later
I
did
n't
see
how
that
was
possible
,
but
he
said
it
was
quite
possible
,
though
unusual
,
to
see
something
like
that
happen
.
As
soon
as
the
baby
was
born
the
people
in
the
room
divided
up
into
two
groups
,
the
nurses
tying
a
metal
dog
tag
on
the
baby
's
wrist
and
swabbing
its
eyes
with
cotton
on
the
end
of
a
stick
and
wrapping
it
up
and
putting
it
in
a
canvas-sided
cot
,
while
the
doctor
and
Will
started
sewing
up
the
woman
's
cut
with
a
needle
and
a
long
thread
.
I
think
somebody
said
,
``
It
's
a
boy
,
Mrs.
Tomolillo
,
''
but
the
woman
did
n't
answer
or
raise
her
head
.
``
Well
,
how
was
it
?
''
Buddy
asked
with
a
satisfied
expression
as
we
walked
across
the
green
quadrangle
to
his
room
.
``
Wonderful
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
could
see
something
like
that
every
day
.
''
I
did
n't
feel
up
to
asking
him
if
there
were
any
other
ways
to
have
babies
.
For
some
reason
the
most
important
thing
to
me
was
actually
seeing
the
baby
come
out
of
you
yourself
and
making
sure
it
was
yours
.
I
thought
if
you
had
to
have
all
that
pain
anyway
you
might
just
as
well
stay
awake
.
I
had
always
imagined
myself
hitching
up
on
to
my
elbows
on
the
delivery
table
after
it
was
all
over
--
dead
white
,
of
course
,
with
no
makeup
and
from
the
awful
ordeal
,
but
smiling
and
radiant
,
with
my
hair
down
to
my
waist
,
and
reaching
out
for
my
first
little
squirmy
child
and
saying
its
name
,
whatever
it
was
.
``
Why
was
it
all
covered
with
flour
?
''
I
asked
then
,
to
keep
the
conversation
going
,
and
Buddy
told
me
about
the
waxy
staff
that
guarded
the
baby
's
skin
.
When
we
were
back
in
Buddy
's
room
,
which
reminded
me
of
nothing
so
much
as
a
monk
's
cell
,
with
its
bare
walls
and
bare
bed
and
bare
floor
and
the
desk
loaded
with
Gray
's
Anatomy
and
other
thick
gruesome
books
,
Buddy
lit
a
candle
and
uncorked
a
bottle
of
Dubonnet
.
Then
we
lay
down
side
by
side
on
the
bed
and
Buddy
sipped
his
wine
while
I
read
aloud
``
somewhere
I
have
never
travelled
''
and
other
poems
from
a
book
I
'd
brought
.
Buddy
said
he
figured
there
must
be
something
in
poetry
if
a
girl
like
me
spent
all
her
days
over
it
,
so
each
time
we
met
I
read
him
some
poetry
and
explained
to
him
what
I
found
in
it
.
It
was
Buddy
's
idea
.
He
always
arranged
our
weekends
so
we
'd
never
regret
wasting
our
time
in
any
way
.
Buddy
's
father
was
a
teacher
,
and
I
think
Buddy
could
have
been
a
teacher
as
well
,
he
was
always
trying
to
explain
things
to
me
and
introduce
me
to
new
knowledge
.
Suddenly
,
after
I
finished
a
poem
,
he
said
,
``
Esther
,
have
you
ever
seen
a
man
?
''
The
way
he
said
it
I
knew
he
did
n't
mean
a
regular
man
or
a
man
in
general
,
I
knew
he
meant
a
man
naked
.
``
No
,
''
I
said
.
``
Only
statues
.
''
``
Well
,
do
n't
you
think
you
would
like
to
see
me
?
''
I
did
n't
know
what
to
say
.
My
mother
and
my
grandmother
had
started
hinting
around
to
me
a
lot
lately
about
what
a
fine
,
clean
boy
Buddy
Willard
was
,
coming
from
such
a
fine
,
clean
family
,
and
how
everybody
at
church
thought
he
was
a
model
person
,
so
kind
to
his
parents
and
to
older
people
,
as
well
as
so
athletic
and
so
handsome
and
so
intelligent
.
All
I
'd
heard
about
,
really
,
was
how
fine
and
clean
Buddy
was
and
how
he
was
the
kind
of
a
person
a
girl
should
stay
fine
and
clean
for
.
So
I
did
n't
really
see
the
harm
in
anything
Buddy
would
think
up
to
do
.
``
Well
,
all
right
,
I
guess
so
,
''
I
said
.
I
stared
at
Buddy
while
he
unzipped
his
chino
pants
and
took
them
off
and
laid
them
on
a
chair
and
then
took
off
his
underpants
that
were
made
of
something
like
nylon
fishnet
.
``
They
're
cool
,
''
he
explained
,
``
and
my
mother
says
they
wash
easily
.
''
Then
he
just
stood
there
in
front
of
me
and
I
kept
staring
at
him
.
The
only
thing
I
could
think
of
was
turkey
neck
and
turkey
gizzards
and
I
felt
very
depressed
.
Buddy
seemed
hurt
I
did
n't
say
anything
.
``
I
think
you
ought
to
get
used
to
me
like
this
,
''
he
said
.
``
Now
let
me
see
you
.
''
But
undressing
in
front
of
Buddy
suddenly
appealed
to
me
about
as
much
as
having
my
Posture
Picture
taken
at
college
,
where
you
have
to
stand
naked
in
front
of
a
camera
,
knowing
all
the
time
that
a
picture
of
you
stark
naked
,
both
full
view
and
side
view
,
is
going
into
the
college
gym
files
to
be
marked
A
B
C
or
D
depending
on
how
straight
you
are
.
``
Oh
,
some
other
time
,
''
I
said
.
``
All
right
.
''
Buddy
got
dressed
again
.
Then
we
kissed
and
hugged
a
while
and
I
felt
a
little
better
.
I
drank
the
rest
of
the
Dubonnet
and
sat
cross-legged
at
the
end
of
Buddy
's
bed
and
asked
for
a
comb
.
I
began
to
comb
my
hair
down
over
my
face
so
Buddy
could
n't
see
it
.
Suddenly
I
said
,
``
Have
you
ever
had
an
affair
with
anyone
,
Buddy
?
''
I
do
n't
know
what
made
me
say
it
,
the
words
just
popped
out
of
my
mouth
.
I
never
thought
for
one
minute
that
Buddy
Willard
would
have
an
affair
with
anyone
.
I
expected
him
to
say
,
``
No
,
I
have
been
saving
myself
for
when
I
get
married
to
somebody
pure
and
a
virgin
like
you
.
''
But
Buddy
did
n't
say
anything
,
he
just
turned
pink
.
``
Well
,
have
you
?
''
``
What
do
you
mean
,
an
affair
?
''
Buddy
asked
then
in
a
hollow
voice
.
``
You
know
,
have
you
ever
gone
to
bed
with
anyone
?
''
I
kept
rhythmically
combing
the
hair
down
over
the
side
of
my
face
nearest
to
Buddy
,
and
I
could
feel
the
little
electric
filaments
clinging
to
my
hot
cheeks
and
I
wanted
to
shout
,
``
Stop
,
stop
,
do
n't
tell
me
,
do
n't
say
anything
.
''
But
I
did
n't
,
I
just
kept
still
.
``
Well
,
yes
,
I
have
,
''
Buddy
said
finally
.
I
almost
fell
over
.
From
the
first
night
Buddy
Willard
kissed
me
and
said
I
must
go
out
with
a
lot
of
boys
,
he
made
me
feel
I
was
much
more
sexy
and
experienced
than
he
was
and
that
everything
he
did
like
hugging
and
kissing
and
petting
was
simply
what
I
made
him
feel
like
doing
out
of
the
blue
,
he
could
n't
help
it
and
did
n't
know
how
it
came
about
.
Now
I
saw
he
had
only
been
pretending
all
this
time
to
be
so
innocent
.
``
Tell
me
about
it
.
''
I
combed
my
hair
slowly
over
and
over
,
feeling
the
teeth
of
the
comb
dig
into
my
cheek
at
every
stroke
.
``
Who
was
it
?
''
Buddy
seemed
relieved
I
was
n't
angry
.
He
even
seemed
relieved
to
have
somebody
to
tell
about
how
he
was
seduced
.
Of
course
,
somebody
had
seduced
Buddy
,
Buddy
had
n't
started
it
and
it
was
n't
really
his
fault
.
It
was
this
waitress
at
the
hotel
he
worked
at
as
a
busboy
the
last
summer
at
Cape
Cod
.
Buddy
had
noticed
her
staring
at
him
queerly
and
shoving
her
breasts
up
against
him
in
the
confusion
of
the
kitchen
,
so
finally
one
day
he
asked
her
what
the
trouble
was
and
she
looked
him
straight
in
the
eye
and
said
,
``
I
want
you
.
''
``
Served
up
with
parsley
?
''
Buddy
had
laughed
innocently
.
``
No
,
''
she
had
said
.
``
Some
night
.
''
And
that
's
how
Buddy
had
lost
his
pureness
and
his
virginity
.
At
first
I
thought
he
must
have
slept
with
the
waitress
only
the
once
,
but
when
I
asked
how
many
times
,
just
to
make
sure
,
he
said
he
could
n't
remember
but
a
couple
of
times
a
week
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
.
I
multiplied
three
by
ten
and
got
thirty
,
which
seemed
beyond
all
reason
.
After
that
something
in
me
just
froze
up
.
Back
at
college
I
started
asking
a
senior
here
and
a
senior
there
what
they
would
do
if
a
boy
they
knew
suddenly
told
them
he
'd
slept
thirty
times
with
some
slutty
waitress
one
summer
,
smack
in
the
middle
of
knowing
them
.
But
these
seniors
said
most
boys
were
like
that
and
you
could
n't
honestly
accuse
them
of
anything
until
you
were
at
least
pinned
or
engaged
to
be
married
.
Actually
,
it
was
n't
the
idea
of
Buddy
sleeping
with
somebody
that
bothered
me
.
I
mean
I
'd
read
about
all
sorts
of
people
sleeping
with
each
other
,
and
if
it
had
been
any
other
boy
I
would
merely
have
asked
him
the
most
interesting
details
,
and
maybe
gone
out
and
slept
with
somebody
myself
just
to
even
things
up
,
and
then
thought
no
more
about
it
.
What
I
could
n't
stand
was
Buddy
's
pretending
I
was
so
sexy
and
he
was
so
pure
,
when
all
the
time
he
'd
been
having
an
affair
with
that
tarty
waitress
and
must
have
felt
like
laughing
in
my
face
.
``
What
does
your
mother
think
about
this
waitress
?
''
I
asked
Buddy
that
weekend
.
Buddy
was
amazingly
close
to
his
mother
.
He
was
always
quoting
what
she
said
about
the
relationship
between
a
man
and
a
woman
,
and
I
knew
Mrs.
Willard
was
a
real
fanatic
about
virginity
for
men
and
women
both
.
When
I
first
went
to
her
house
for
supper
she
gave
me
a
queer
,
shrewd
,
searching
look
,
and
I
knew
she
was
trying
to
tell
whether
I
was
a
virgin
or
not
.
Just
as
I
thought
,
Buddy
was
embarrassed
.
``
Mother
asked
me
about
Gladys
,
''
he
admitted
.
``
Well
,
what
did
you
say
?
''
``
I
said
Gladys
was
free
,
white
and
twenty-one
.
''
Now
I
knew
Buddy
would
never
talk
to
his
mother
as
rudely
as
that
for
my
sake
.
He
was
always
saying
how
his
mother
said
,
``
What
a
man
wants
is
a
mate
and
what
a
woman
wants
is
infinite
security
,
''
and
,
``
What
a
man
is
is
an
arrow
into
the
future
and
what
a
woman
is
is
the
place
the
arrow
shoots
off
from
,
''
until
it
made
me
tired
.
Every
time
I
tried
to
argue
,
Buddy
would
say
his
mother
still
got
pleasure
out
of
his
father
and
was
n't
that
wonderful
for
people
their
age
,
it
must
mean
she
really
knew
what
was
what
.
Well
,
I
had
just
decided
to
ditch
Buddy
Willard
for
once
and
for
all
,
not
because
he
'd
slept
with
that
waitress
but
because
he
did
n't
have
the
honest
guts
to
admit
it
straight
off
to
everybody
and
face
up
to
it
as
part
of
his
character
,
when
the
phone
in
the
hall
rang
and
somebody
said
in
a
little
knowing
singsong
,
``
It
's
for
you
,
Esther
,
it
's
from
Boston
.
''
I
could
tell
right
away
something
must
be
wrong
,
because
Buddy
was
the
only
person
I
knew
in
Boston
,
and
he
never
called
me
long
distance
because
it
was
so
much
more
expensive
than
letters
.
Once
,
when
he
had
a
message
he
wanted
me
to
get
almost
immediately
,
he
went
all
round
his
entry
at
medical
school
asking
if
anybody
was
driving
up
to
my
college
that
weekend
,
and
sure
enough
,
somebody
was
,
so
he
gave
them
a
note
for
me
and
I
got
it
the
same
day
.
He
did
n't
even
have
to
pay
for
a
stamp
.
It
was
Buddy
all
right
.
He
told
me
that
the
annual
fall
chest
X-ray
showed
he
had
caught
TB
and
he
was
going
off
on
a
scholarship
for
medical
students
who
caught
TB
to
a
TB
place
in
the
Adirondacks
.
Then
he
said
I
had
n't
written
since
that
last
weekend
and
he
hoped
nothing
was
the
matter
between
us
,
and
would
I
please
try
to
write
him
at
least
once
a
week
and
come
to
visit
him
at
this
TB
place
in
my
Christmas
vacation
?
I
had
never
heard
Buddy
so
upset
.
He
was
very
proud
of
his
perfect
health
and
was
always
telling
me
it
was
psychosomatic
when
my
sinuses
blocked
up
and
I
could
n't
breathe
.
I
thought
this
an
odd
attitude
for
a
doctor
to
have
and
perhaps
he
should
study
to
be
a
psychiatrist
instead
,
but
of
course
I
never
came
right
out
and
said
so
.
I
told
Buddy
how
sorry
I
was
about
the
TB
and
promised
to
write
,
but
when
I
hung
up
I
did
n't
feel
one
bit
sorry
.
I
only
felt
a
wonderful
relief
.
I
thought
the
TB
might
just
be
a
punishment
for
living
the
kind
of
double
life
Buddy
lived
and
feeling
so
superior
to
people
.
And
I
thought
how
convenient
it
would
be
now
I
did
n't
have
to
announce
to
everybody
at
college
I
had
broken
off
with
Buddy
and
start
the
boring
business
of
blind
dates
all
over
again
.
I
simply
told
everyone
that
Buddy
had
TB
and
we
were
practically
engaged
,
and
when
I
stayed
in
to
study
on
Saturday
nights
they
were
extremely
kind
to
me
because
they
thought
I
was
so
brave
,
working
the
way
I
did
just
to
hide
a
broken
heart
Seven
OF
COURSE
,
Constantin
was
much
too
short
,
but
in
his
own
way
he
was
handsome
,
with
light
brown
hair
and
dark
blue
eyes
and
a
lively
,
challenging
expression
.
He
could
almost
have
been
an
American
,
he
was
so
tan
and
had
such
good
teeth
,
but
I
could
tell
straight
away
that
he
was
n't
.
He
had
what
no
American
man
I
've
ever
met
has
had
,
and
that
's
intuition
.
From
the
start
Constantin
guessed
I
was
n't
any
protégé
of
Mrs.
Willard
's
.
I
raised
an
eyebrow
here
and
dropped
a
dry
little
laugh
there
,
and
pretty
soon
we
were
both
openly
raking
Mrs.
Willard
over
the
coals
and
I
thought
,
``
This
Constantin
wo
n't
mind
if
I
'm
too
tall
and
do
n't
know
enough
languages
and
have
n't
been
to
Europe
,
he
'll
see
through
all
that
stuff
to
what
I
really
am
.
''
Constantin
drove
me
to
the
UN
in
his
old
green
convertible
with
cracked
,
comfortable
brown
leather
seats
and
the
top
down
.
He
told
me
his
tan
came
from
playing
tennis
,
and
when
we
were
sitting
there
side
by
side
flying
down
the
streets
in
the
open
sun
he
took
my
hand
and
squeezed
it
,
and
I
felt
happier
than
I
had
been
since
I
was
about
nine
and
running
along
the
hot
white
beaches
with
my
father
the
summer
before
he
died
.
And
while
Constantin
and
I
sat
in
one
of
those
hushed
plush
auditoriums
in
the
UN
,
next
to
a
stern
muscular
Russian
girl
with
no
makeup
who
was
a
simultaneous
interpreter
like
Constantin
,
I
thought
how
strange
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
before
that
I
was
only
purely
happy
until
I
was
nine
years
old
.
After
that
--
in
spite
of
the
Girl
Scouts
and
the
piano
lessons
and
the
water-color
lessons
and
the
dancing
lessons
and
the
sailing
camp
,
all
of
which
my
mother
scrimped
to
give
me
,
and
college
,
with
crewing
in
the
mist
before
breakfast
and
blackbottom
pies
and
the
little
new
firecrackers
of
ideas
going
off
every
day
--
I
had
never
been
really
happy
again
.
I
stared
through
the
Russian
girl
in
her
double-breasted
gray
suit
,
rattling
off
idiom
after
idiom
in
her
own
unknowable
tongue
--
which
Constantin
said
was
the
most
difficult
part
because
the
Russians
did
n't
have
the
same
idioms
as
our
idioms
--
and
I
wished
with
all
my
heart
I
could
crawl
into
her
and
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
barking
out
one
idiom
after
another
.
It
might
n't
make
me
any
happier
,
but
it
would
be
one
more
little
pebble
of
efficiency
among
all
the
other
pebbles
.
Then
Constantin
and
the
Russian
girl
interpreter
and
the
whole
bunch
of
black
and
white
and
yellow
men
arguing
down
there
behind
their
labeled
microphones
seemed
to
move
off
at
a
distance
.
I
saw
their
mouths
going
up
and
down
without
a
sound
,
as
if
they
were
sitting
on
the
deck
of
a
departing
ship
,
stranding
me
in
the
middle
of
a
huge
silence
.
I
started
adding
up
all
the
things
I
could
n't
do
.
I
began
with
cooking
.
My
grandmother
and
my
mother
were
such
good
cooks
that
I
left
everything
to
them
.
They
were
always
trying
to
teach
me
one
dish
or
another
,
but
I
would
just
look
on
and
say
,
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
see
,
''
while
the
instructions
slid
through
my
head
like
water
,
and
then
I
'd
always
spoil
what
I
did
so
nobody
would
ask
me
to
do
it
again
.
I
remember
Jody
,
my
best
and
only
girlfriend
at
college
in
my
freshman
year
,
making
me
scrambled
eggs
at
her
house
one
morning
.
They
tasted
unusual
,
and
when
I
asked
her
if
she
had
put
in
anything
extra
,
she
said
cheese
and
garlic
salt
.
I
asked
who
told
her
to
do
that
,
and
she
said
nobody
,
she
just
thought
it
up
.
But
then
,
she
was
practical
and
a
sociology
major
.
I
did
n't
know
shorthand
either
.
This
meant
I
could
n't
get
a
good
job
after
college
.
My
mother
kept
telling
me
nobody
wanted
a
plain
English
major
.
But
an
English
major
who
knew
shorthand
was
something
else
again
.
Everybody
would
want
her
.
She
would
be
in
demand
among
all
the
up-and-coming
young
men
and
she
would
transcribe
letter
after
thrilling
letter
.
The
trouble
was
,
I
hated
the
idea
of
serving
men
in
any
way
.
I
wanted
to
dictate
my
own
thrilling
letters
.
Besides
,
those
little
shorthand
symbols
in
the
book
my
mother
showed
me
seemed
just
as
bad
as
let
t
equal
time
and
let
s
equal
the
total
distance
.
My
list
grew
longer
.
I
was
a
terrible
dancer
.
I
could
n't
carry
a
tune
.
I
had
no
sense
of
balance
,
and
when
we
had
to
walk
down
a
narrow
board
with
our
hands
out
and
a
book
on
our
heads
in
gym
class
I
always
fell
over
.
I
could
n't
ride
a
horse
or
ski
,
the
two
things
I
wanted
to
do
most
,
because
they
cost
too
much
money
.
I
could
n't
speak
German
or
read
Hebrew
or
write
Chinese
.
I
did
n't
even
know
where
most
of
the
old
out-of-the-way
countries
the
UN
men
in
front
of
me
represented
fitted
in
on
the
map
.
For
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
sitting
there
in
the
soundproof
heart
of
the
UN
building
between
Constantin
who
could
play
tennis
as
well
as
simultaneouly
interpret
and
the
Russian
girl
who
knew
so
many
idioms
,
I
felt
dreadfully
inadequate
.
The
trouble
was
,
I
had
been
inadequate
all
along
,
I
simply
had
n't
thought
about
it
.
The
one
thing
I
was
good
at
was
winning
scholarships
and
prizes
,
and
that
era
was
coming
to
an
end
.
I
felt
like
a
racehorse
in
a
world
without
racetracks
or
a
champion
college
footballer
suddenly
confronted
by
Wall
Street
and
a
business
suit
,
his
days
of
glory
shrunk
to
a
little
gold
cup
on
his
mantel
with
a
date
engraved
on
it
like
the
date
on
a
tombstone
.
I
saw
my
life
branching
out
before
me
like
the
green
fig
tree
in
the
story
.
From
the
tip
of
every
branch
,
like
a
fat
purple
fig
,
a
wonderful
future
beckoned
and
winked
.
One
fig
was
a
husband
and
a
happy
home
and
children
,
and
another
fig
was
a
famous
poet
and
another
fig
was
a
brilliant
professor
,
and
another
fig
was
Ee
Gee
,
the
amazing
editor
,
and
another
fig
was
Europe
and
Africa
and
South
America
,
and
another
fig
was
Constantin
and
Socrates
and
Attila
and
a
pack
of
other
lovers
with
queer
names
and
offbeat
professions
,
and
another
fig
was
an
Olympic
lady
crew
champion
,
and
beyond
and
above
these
figs
were
many
more
figs
I
could
n't
quite
make
out
.
I
saw
myself
sitting
in
the
crotch
of
this
fig
tree
,
starving
to
death
,
just
because
I
could
n't
make
up
my
mind
which
of
the
figs
I
would
choose
.
I
wanted
each
and
every
one
of
them
,
but
choosing
one
meant
losing
all
the
rest
,
and
,
as
I
sat
there
,
unable
to
decide
,
the
figs
began
to
wrinkle
and
go
black
,
and
,
one
by
one
,
they
plopped
to
the
ground
at
my
feet
.
Constantin
's
restaurant
smelt
of
herbs
and
spices
and
sour
cream
.
All
the
time
I
had
been
in
New
York
I
had
never
found
such
a
restaurant
.
I
only
found
those
Heavenly
Hamburger
places
,
where
they
serve
giant
hamburgers
and
soup-of-the-day
and
four
kinds
of
fancy
cake
at
a
very
clean
counter
facing
a
long
glarey
mirror
.
To
reach
this
restaurant
we
had
to
climb
down
seven
dimly
lit
steps
into
a
sort
of
cellar
.
Travel
posters
plastered
the
smoke-dark
walls
,
like
so
many
picture
windows
overlooking
Swiss
lakes
and
Japanese
mountains
and
African
velds
,
and
thick
,
dusty
bottle-candles
,
that
seemed
for
centuries
to
have
wept
their
colored
waxes
red
over
blue
over
green
in
a
fine
,
three-dimensional
lace
,
cast
a
circle
of
light
round
each
table
where
the
faces
floated
,
flushed
and
flamelike
themselves
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
ate
,
but
I
felt
immensely
better
after
the
first
mouthful
.
It
occurred
to
me
that
my
vision
of
the
fig
tree
and
all
the
fat
figs
that
withered
and
fell
to
earth
might
well
have
arisen
from
the
profound
void
of
an
empty
stomach
.
Constantin
kept
refilling
our
glasses
with
a
sweet
Greek
wine
that
tasted
of
pine
bark
,
and
I
found
myself
telling
him
how
I
was
going
to
learn
German
and
go
to
Europe
and
be
a
war
correspondent
like
Maggie
Higgins
.
I
felt
so
fine
by
the
time
we
came
to
the
yogurt
and
strawberry
jam
that
I
decided
I
would
let
Constantin
seduce
me
.
Ever
since
Buddy
Willard
had
told
me
about
that
waitress
I
had
been
thinking
I
ought
to
go
out
and
sleep
with
somebody
myself
.
Sleeping
with
Buddy
would
n't
count
,
though
,
because
he
would
still
be
one
person
ahead
of
me
,
it
would
have
to
be
with
somebody
else
.
The
only
boy
I
ever
actually
discussed
going
to
bed
with
was
a
bitter
,
hawk-nosed
Southerner
from
Yale
,
who
came
to
college
one
weekend
only
to
find
his
date
had
eloped
with
a
taxi
driver
the
day
before
.
As
the
girl
had
lived
in
my
house
and
I
was
the
only
one
home
that
particular
night
,
it
was
my
job
to
cheer
him
up
.
At
the
local
coffee
shop
,
hunched
in
one
of
the
secretive
,
high-backed
booths
with
hundreds
of
people
's
names
gouged
into
the
wood
,
we
drank
cup
after
cup
of
black
coffee
and
talked
frankly
about
sex
.
This
boy
--
his
name
was
Eric
--
said
he
thought
it
disgusting
the
way
all
the
girls
at
my
college
stood
around
on
the
porches
under
the
lights
and
in
the
bushes
in
plain
view
,
necking
madly
before
the
one
o'clock
curfew
,
so
everybody
passing
by
could
see
them
.
A
million
years
of
evolution
,
Eric
said
bitterly
,
and
what
are
we
?
Animals
.
Then
Eric
told
me
how
he
had
slept
with
his
first
woman
.
He
went
to
a
Southern
prep
school
that
specialized
in
building
all-round
gentlemen
,
and
by
the
time
you
graduated
it
was
an
unwritten
rule
that
you
had
to
have
known
a
woman
.
Known
in
the
Biblical
sense
,
Eric
said
.
So
one
Saturday
Eric
and
a
few
of
his
classmates
took
a
bus
into
the
nearest
city
and
visited
a
notorious
whorehouse
.
Eric
's
whore
had
n't
even
taken
off
her
dress
.
She
was
a
fat
,
middle-aged
woman
with
dyed
red
hair
and
suspiciously
thick
lips
and
rat-colored
skin
and
she
would
n't
turn
off
the
light
,
so
he
had
had
her
under
a
fly-spotted
twenty-five-
watt
bulb
,
and
it
was
nothing
like
it
was
cracked
up
to
be
.
It
was
boring
as
going
to
the
toilet
,
I
said
maybe
if
you
loved
a
woman
it
would
n't
seem
so
boring
,
but
Eric
said
it
would
be
spoiled
by
thinking
this
woman
too
was
just
an
animal
like
the
rest
,
so
if
he
loved
anybody
he
would
never
go
to
bed
with
her
.
He
'd
go
to
a
whore
if
he
had
to
and
keep
the
woman
he
loved
free
of
all
that
dirty
business
.
It
had
crossed
my
mind
at
the
time
that
Eric
might
be
a
good
person
to
go
to
bed
with
,
since
he
had
already
done
it
and
,
unlike
the
usual
run
of
boys
,
did
n't
seem
dirty-
minded
or
silly
when
he
talked
about
it
.
But
then
Eric
wrote
me
a
letter
saying
he
thought
he
might
really
be
able
to
love
me
,
I
was
so
intelligent
and
cynical
and
yet
had
such
a
kind
face
,
surprisingly
like
his
older
sister
's
;
so
I
knew
it
was
no
use
,
I
was
the
type
he
would
never
go
to
bed
with
,
and
wrote
him
I
was
unfortunately
about
to
marry
a
childhood
sweetheart
.
The
more
I
thought
about
it
the
better
I
liked
the
idea
of
being
seduced
by
a
simultaneous
interpreter
in
New
York
City
.
Constantin
seemed
mature
and
considerate
in
every
way
.
There
were
no
people
I
knew
he
would
want
to
brag
to
about
it
,
the
way
college
boys
bragged
about
sleeping
with
girls
in
the
backs
of
cars
to
their
roommates
or
their
friends
on
the
basketball
team
.
And
there
would
be
a
pleasant
irony
in
sleeping
with
a
man
Mrs.
Willard
had
introduced
me
to
,
as
if
she
were
,
in
a
roundabout
way
,
to
blame
for
it
.
When
Constantin
asked
if
I
would
like
to
come
up
to
his
apartment
to
hear
some
balalaika
records
I
smiled
to
myself
.
My
mother
had
always
told
me
never
under
any
circumstances
to
go
with
a
man
to
a
man
's
rooms
after
an
evening
out
,
it
could
mean
only
one
thing
.
``
I
am
very
fond
of
balalaika
music
,
''
I
said
.
Constantin
's
room
had
a
balcony
,
and
the
balcony
overlooked
the
river
,
and
we
could
hear
the
hooing
of
the
tugs
down
in
the
darkness
.
I
felt
moved
and
tender
and
perfectly
certain
about
what
I
was
going
to
do
.
I
knew
I
might
have
a
baby
,
but
that
thought
hung
far
and
dim
in
the
distance
and
did
n't
trouble
me
at
all
.
There
was
no
one
hundred
per
cent
sure
way
not
to
have
a
baby
,
it
said
in
an
article
my
mother
cut
out
of
the
Reader
's
Digest
and
mailed
to
me
at
college
.
This
article
was
written
by
a
married
woman
lawyer
with
children
and
called
``
In
Defense
of
Chastity
.
''
It
gave
all
the
reasons
a
girl
should
n't
sleep
with
anybody
but
her
husband
and
then
only
after
they
were
married
.
The
main
point
of
the
article
was
that
a
man
's
world
is
different
from
a
woman
's
world
and
a
man
's
emotions
are
different
from
a
woman
's
emotions
and
only
marriage
can
bring
the
two
worlds
and
the
two
different
sets
of
emotions
together
properly
.
My
mother
said
this
was
something
a
girl
did
n't
know
about
till
it
was
too
late
,
so
she
had
to
take
the
advice
of
people
who
were
already
experts
,
like
a
married
woman
.
This
woman
lawyer
said
the
best
men
wanted
to
be
pure
for
their
wives
,
and
even
if
they
were
n't
pure
,
they
wanted
to
be
the
ones
to
teach
their
wives
about
sex
.
Of
course
they
would
try
to
persuade
a
girl
to
have
sex
and
say
they
would
marry
her
later
,
but
as
soon
as
she
gave
in
,
they
would
lose
all
respect
for
her
and
start
saying
that
if
she
did
that
with
them
she
would
do
that
with
other
men
and
they
would
end
up
by
making
her
life
miserable
.
The
woman
finished
her
article
by
saying
better
be
safe
than
sorry
and
besides
,
there
was
no
sure
way
of
not
getting
stuck
with
a
baby
and
then
you
'd
really
be
in
a
pickle
.
Now
the
one
thing
this
article
did
n't
seem
to
me
to
consider
was
how
a
girl
felt
.
It
might
be
nice
to
be
pure
and
then
to
marry
a
pure
man
,
but
what
if
he
suddenly
confessed
he
was
n't
pure
after
we
were
married
,
the
way
Buddy
Willard
had
?
I
could
n't
stand
the
idea
of
a
woman
having
to
have
a
single
pure
life
and
a
man
being
able
to
have
a
double
life
,
one
pure
and
one
not
.
Finally
I
decided
that
if
it
was
so
difficult
to
find
a
red-blooded
intelligent
man
who
was
still
pure
by
the
time
he
was
twenty-one
I
might
as
well
forget
about
staying
pure
myself
and
marry
somebody
who
was
n't
pure
either
.
Then
when
he
started
to
make
my
life
miserable
I
could
make
his
miserable
as
well
.
When
I
was
nineteen
,
pureness
was
the
great
issue
.
Instead
of
the
world
being
divided
up
into
Catholics
and
Protestants
or
Republicans
and
Democrats
or
white
men
and
black
men
or
even
men
and
women
,
I
saw
the
world
divided
into
people
who
had
slept
with
somebody
and
people
who
had
n't
,
and
this
seemed
the
only
really
significant
difference
between
one
person
and
another
.
I
thought
a
spectacular
change
would
come
over
me
the
day
I
crossed
the
boundary
line
.
I
thought
it
would
be
the
way
I
'd
feel
if
I
ever
visited
Europe
.
I
'd
come
home
,
and
if
I
looked
closely
into
the
mirror
I
'd
be
able
to
make
out
a
little
white
Alp
at
the
back
of
my
eye
.
Now
I
thought
that
if
I
looked
into
the
mirror
tomorrow
I
'd
see
a
doll-size
Constantin
sitting
in
my
eye
and
smiling
out
at
me
.
Well
,
for
about
an
hour
we
lounged
on
Constantin
's
balcony
in
two
separate
slingback
chairs
with
the
victrola
playing
and
the
balalaika
records
stacked
between
us
.
A
faint
milky
light
diffused
from
the
street
lights
or
the
half
moon
or
the
cars
or
the
stars
,
I
could
n't
tell
what
,
but
apart
from
holding
my
hand
Constantin
showed
no
desire
to
seduce
me
whatsoever
.
I
asked
if
he
was
engaged
or
had
any
special
girlfriend
,
thinking
maybe
that
's
what
was
the
matter
,
but
he
said
no
,
he
made
a
point
of
keeping
clear
of
such
attachments
.
At
last
I
felt
a
powerful
drowsiness
drifting
through
my
veins
from
all
the
pine-
bark
wine
I
had
drunk
.
``
I
think
I
'll
go
in
and
lie
down
,
''
I
said
.
I
strolled
casually
into
the
bedroom
and
stooped
over
to
nudge
off
my
shoes
.
The
clean
bed
bobbed
before
me
like
a
safe
boat
.
I
stretched
full
length
and
shut
my
eyes
.
Then
I
heard
Constantin
sigh
and
come
in
from
the
balcony
.
One
by
one
his
shoes
clonked
on
to
the
floor
,
and
he
lay
down
by
my
side
.
I
looked
at
him
secretly
from
under
a
fall
of
hair
.
He
was
lying
on
his
back
,
his
hands
under
his
head
,
staring
at
the
ceiling
.
The
starched
white
sleeves
of
his
shirt
,
rolled
up
to
the
elbows
,
glimmered
eerily
in
the
half
dark
and
his
tan
skin
seemed
almost
black
.
I
thought
be
must
be
the
most
beautiful
man
I
'd
ever
seen
.
I
thought
if
only
I
had
a
keen
,
shapely
bone
structure
to
my
face
or
could
discuss
politics
shrewdly
or
was
a
famous
writer
Constantin
might
find
me
interesting
enough
to
sleep
with
.
And
then
I
wondered
if
as
soon
as
he
came
to
like
me
he
would
sink
into
ordinariness
,
and
if
as
soon
as
he
came
to
love
me
I
would
find
fault
after
fault
,
the
way
I
did
with
Buddy
Willard
and
the
boys
before
him
.
The
same
thing
happened
over
and
over
:
I
would
catch
sight
of
some
flawless
man
off
in
the
distance
,
but
as
soon
as
he
moved
closer
I
immediately
saw
he
would
n't
do
at
all
.
That
's
one
of
the
reasons
I
never
wanted
to
get
married
.
The
last
thing
I
wanted
was
infinite
security
and
to
be
the
place
an
arrow
shoots
off
from
.
I
wanted
change
and
excitement
and
to
shoot
off
in
all
directions
myself
,
like
the
colored
arrows
from
a
Fourth
of
July
rocket
.
I
woke
to
the
sound
of
rain
.
It
was
pitch
dark
.
After
a
while
I
deciphered
the
faint
outlines
of
an
unfamiliar
window
.
Every
so
often
a
beam
of
light
appeared
out
of
thin
air
,
traversed
the
wall
like
a
ghostly
,
exploratory
finger
,
and
slid
off
into
nothing
again
.
Then
I
heard
the
sound
of
somebody
breathing
.
At
first
I
thought
it
was
only
myself
,
and
that
I
was
lying
in
the
dark
in
my
hotel
room
after
being
poisoned
.
I
held
my
breath
,
but
the
breathing
kept
on
.
A
green
eye
glowed
on
the
bed
beside
me
.
It
was
divided
into
quarters
like
a
compass
.
I
reached
out
slowly
and
dosed
my
hand
on
it
.
I
lifted
it
up
.
With
it
came
an
arm
,
heavy
as
a
dead
man
's
,
but
warm
with
sleep
.
Constantin
's
watch
said
three
o'clock
.
He
was
lying
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
and
stocking
feet
just
as
I
had
left
him
when
I
dropped
asleep
,
and
as
my
eyes
grew
used
to
the
darkness
I
made
out
his
pale
eyelids
and
his
straight
nose
and
his
tolerant
,
shapely
mouth
,
but
they
seemed
insubstantial
,
as
if
drawn
on
fog
.
For
a
few
minutes
I
leaned
over
,
studying
him
.
I
had
never
fallen
asleep
beside
a
man
before
.
I
tried
to
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
if
Constantin
were
my
husband
.
It
would
mean
getting
up
at
seven
and
cooking
him
eggs
and
bacon
and
toast
and
coffee
and
dawdling
about
in
my
nightgown
and
curlers
after
he
'd
left
for
work
to
wash
up
the
dirty
plates
and
make
the
bed
,
and
then
when
he
came
home
after
a
lively
,
fascinating
day
he
'd
expect
a
big
dinner
,
and
I
'd
spend
the
evening
washing
up
even
more
dirty
plates
till
I
fell
into
bed
,
utterly
exhausted
.
This
seemed
a
dreary
and
wasted
life
for
a
girl
with
fifteen
years
of
straight
A
's
,
but
I
knew
that
's
what
marriage
was
like
,
because
cook
and
clean
and
wash
was
just
what
Buddy
Willard
's
mother
did
from
morning
till
night
,
and
she
was
the
wife
of
a
university
professor
and
had
been
a
private
school
teacher
herself
.
Once
when
I
visited
Buddy
I
found
Mrs.
Willard
braiding
a
rug
out
of
strips
of
wool
from
Mr.
Willard
's
old
suits
.
She
'd
spent
weeks
on
that
rug
,
and
I
had
admired
the
tweedy
browns
and
greens
and
blues
patterning
the
braid
,
but
after
Mrs.
Willard
was
through
,
instead
of
hanging
the
rug
on
the
wall
the
way
I
would
have
done
,
she
put
it
down
in
place
of
her
kitchen
mat
,
and
in
a
few
days
it
was
soiled
and
dull
and
indistinguishable
from
any
mat
you
could
buy
for
under
a
dollar
in
the
five
and
ten
.
And
I
knew
that
in
spite
of
all
the
roses
and
kisses
and
restaurant
dinners
a
man
showered
on
a
woman
before
he
married
her
,
what
he
secretly
wanted
when
the
wedding
service
ended
was
for
her
to
flatten
out
underneath
his
feet
like
Mrs.
Willard
's
kitchen
mat
Had
n't
my
own
mother
told
me
that
as
soon
as
she
and
my
father
left
Reno
on
their
honeymoon
--
my
father
had
been
married
before
,
so
he
needed
a
divorce
--
my
father
said
to
her
,
``
Whew
,
that
's
a
relief
,
now
we
can
stop
pretending
and
be
ourselves
''
?
-
-
and
from
that
day
on
my
mother
never
had
a
minute
's
peace
.
I
also
remembered
Buddy
Willard
saying
in
a
sinister
,
knowing
way
that
after
I
had
children
I
would
feel
differently
,
I
would
n't
want
to
write
poems
any
more
.
So
I
began
to
think
maybe
it
was
true
that
when
you
were
married
and
had
children
it
was
like
being
brainwashed
,
and
afterward
you
went
about
numb
as
a
slave
in
some
private
,
totalitarian
state
.
As
I
stared
down
at
Constantin
the
way
you
stare
down
at
a
bright
,
unattainable
pebble
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
well
,
his
eyelids
lifted
and
he
looked
through
me
,
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
love
.
I
watched
dumbly
as
a
shutter
of
recognition
clicked
across
the
blur
of
tenderness
and
the
wide
pupils
went
glossy
and
depthless
as
patent
leather
.
Constantin
sat
up
,
yawning
.
``
What
time
is
it
?
''
``
Three
,
''
I
said
in
a
flat
voice
.
``
I
better
go
home
.
I
have
to
be
at
work
first
thing
in
the
morning
.
''
``
I
'll
drive
you
.
''
As
we
sat
back
to
back
on
our
separate
sides
of
the
bed
fumbling
with
our
shoes
in
the
horrid
cheerful
white
light
of
the
bed
lamp
,
I
sensed
Constantin
turn
round
.
``
Is
your
hair
always
like
that
?
''
``
Like
what
?
''
He
did
n't
answer
but
reached
over
and
put
his
hand
at
the
root
of
my
hair
and
ran
his
fingers
out
slowly
to
the
tip
ends
like
a
comb
.
A
little
electric
shock
flared
through
me
and
I
sat
quite
still
.
Ever
since
I
was
small
I
loved
feeling
somebody
comb
my
hair
.
It
made
me
go
all
sleepy
and
peaceful
.
``
Ah
,
I
know
what
it
is
,
''
Constantin
said
.
``
You
've
just
washed
it
.
''
And
he
bent
to
lace
up
his
tennis
shoes
.
An
hour
later
I
lay
in
my
hotel
bed
,
listening
to
the
rain
.
It
did
n't
even
sound
like
rain
,
it
sounded
like
a
tap
running
.
The
ache
in
the
middle
of
my
left
shin
bone
came
to
life
,
and
I
abandoned
any
hope
of
sleep
before
seven
,
when
my
radio-alarm
clock
would
rouse
me
with
its
hearty
renderings
of
Sousa
.
Every
time
it
rained
the
old
leg-break
seemed
to
remember
itself
,
and
what
it
remembered
was
a
dull
hurt
.
Then
I
thought
,
``
Buddy
Willard
made
me
break
that
leg
.
''
Then
I
thought
,
``
No
,
I
broke
it
myself
.
I
broke
it
on
purpose
to
pay
myself
back
for
being
such
a
heel
.
''
Eight
MR.
WILLARD
drove
me
up
to
the
Adirondacks
.
It
was
the
day
after
Christmas
and
a
gray
sky
bellied
over
us
,
fat
with
snow
.
I
felt
overstuffed
and
dull
and
disappointed
,
the
way
I
always
do
the
day
after
Christmas
,
as
if
whatever
it
was
the
pine
boughs
and
the
candles
and
the
silver
and
gilt-ribboned
presents
and
the
birch-log
fires
and
the
Christmas
turkey
and
the
carols
and
the
piano
promised
never
came
to
pass
.
At
Christmas
I
almost
wished
I
was
a
Catholic
.
First
Mr.
Willard
drove
and
then
I
drove
.
I
do
n't
know
what
we
talked
about
,
but
as
the
countryside
,
already
deep
under
old
falls
of
snow
,
turned
us
a
bleaker
shoulder
,
and
as
the
fir
trees
crowded
down
from
the
gray
hills
to
the
road
edge
,
so
darkly
green
they
looked
black
,
I
grew
gloomier
and
gloomier
.
I
was
tempted
to
tell
Mr.
Willard
to
go
ahead
alone
,
I
would
hitchhike
home
.
But
one
glance
at
Mr.
Willard
's
face
--
the
silver
hair
in
its
boyish
crewcut
,
the
clear
blue
eyes
,
the
pink
cheeks
,
all
frosted
like
a
sweet
wedding
cake
with
the
innocent
,
trusting
expression
--
and
I
knew
I
could
n't
do
it
.
I
'd
have
to
see
the
visit
through
to
the
end
.
At
midday
the
grayness
paled
a
bit
,
and
we
parked
in
an
icy
turnoff
and
shared
out
the
tunafish
sandwiches
and
the
oatmeal
cookies
and
the
apples
and
the
thermos
of
black
coffee
Mrs.
Willard
had
packed
for
our
lunch
.
Mr.
Willard
eyed
me
kindly
.
Then
he
cleared
his
throat
and
brushed
a
few
last
crumbs
from
his
lap
.
I
could
tell
he
was
going
to
say
something
serious
,
because
he
was
very
shy
,
and
I
'd
heard
him
dear
his
throat
in
that
same
way
before
giving
an
important
economics
lecture
.
``
Nelly
and
I
have
always
wanted
a
daughter
.
''
For
one
crazy
minute
I
thought
,
Mr.
Willard
was
going
to
announce
that
Mrs.
Willard
was
pregnant
and
expecting
a
baby
girl
.
Then
he
said
,
``
But
I
do
n't
see
how
any
daughter
could
be
nicer
than
you
.
''
Mr.
Willard
must
have
thought
I
was
crying
because
I
was
so
glad
he
wanted
to
be
a
father
to
me
.
``
There
,
there
,
''
he
patted
my
shoulder
and
cleared
his
throat
once
or
twice
.
``
I
think
we
understand
each
other
.
''
Then
he
opened
the
car
door
on
his
side
and
strolled
round
to
my
side
,
his
breath
shaping
tortuous
smoke
signals
in
the
gray
air
.
I
moved
over
to
the
seat
he
had
left
and
he
started
the
car
and
we
drove
on
.
I
'm
not
sure
what
I
expected
of
Buddy
's
sanatorium
.
I
think
I
expected
a
kind
of
wooden
chalet
perched
up
on
top
of
a
small
mountain
,
with
rosy-cheeked
young
men
and
women
,
all
very
attractive
but
with
hectic
glittering
eyes
,
lying
covered
with
thick
blankets
on
outdoor
balconies
.
``
TB
is
like
living
with
a
bomb
in
your
lung
,
''
Buddy
had
written
to
me
at
college
.
``
You
just
lie
around
very
quietly
hoping
it
wo
n't
go
off
.
''
I
found
it
hard
to
imagine
Buddy
lying
quietly
.
His
whole
philosophy
of
life
was
to
be
up
and
doing
every
second
.
Even
when
we
went
to
the
beach
in
the
summer
he
never
lay
down
to
drowse
in
the
sun
the
way
I
did
.
He
ran
back
and
forth
or
played
ball
or
did
a
little
series
of
rapid
pushups
to
use
the
time
.
Mr.
Willard
and
I
waited
in
the
reception
room
for
the
end
of
the
afternoon
rest
cure
.
The
color
scheme
of
the
whole
sanatorium
seemed
to
be
based
on
liver
.
Dark
,
glowering
woodwork
,
burnt-brown
leather
chairs
,
walls
that
might
once
have
been
white
but
had
succumbed
under
a
spreading
malady
of
mold
or
damp
.
A
mottled
brown
linoleum
sealed
off
the
floor
.
On
a
low
coffee
table
,
with
circular
and
semicircular
stains
bitten
into
the
dark
veneer
,
lay
a
few
wilted
numbers
of
Time
and
Life
.
I
flipped
to
the
middle
of
the
nearest
magazine
.
The
face
of
Eisenhower
beamed
up
at
me
,
bald
and
blank
as
the
face
of
a
fetus
in
a
bottle
.
After
a
while
I
became
aware
of
a
sly
,
leaking
noise
.
For
a
minute
I
thought
the
walls
had
begun
to
discharge
the
moisture
that
must
saturate
them
,
but
then
I
saw
the
noise
came
from
a
small
fountain
in
one
corner
of
the
room
.
The
fountain
spurted
a
few
inches
into
the
air
from
a
rough
length
of
pipe
,
threw
up
its
hands
,
collapsed
and
drowned
its
ragged
dribble
in
a
stone
basin
of
yellowing
water
.
The
basin
was
paved
with
the
white
hexagonal
tiles
one
finds
in
public
lavatories
.
A
buzzer
sounded
.
Doors
opened
and
shut
in
the
distance
.
Then
Buddy
came
in
.
``
Hello
,
Dad
.
''
Buddy
hugged
his
father
,
and
promptly
,
with
a
dreadful
brightness
,
came
over
to
me
and
held
out
his
hand
.
I
shook
it
.
It
felt
moist
and
fat
.
Mr.
Willard
and
I
sat
together
on
a
leather
couch
.
Buddy
perched
opposite
us
on
the
edge
of
a
slippery
armchair
.
He
kept
smiling
,
as
if
the
corners
of
his
mouth
were
strung
up
on
invisible
wire
.
The
last
thing
I
expected
was
for
Buddy
to
be
fat
.
All
the
time
I
thought
of
him
at
the
sanatorium
I
saw
shadows
carving
themselves
under
his
cheekbones
and
his
eyes
burning
out
of
almost
fleshless
sockets
.
But
everything
concave
about
Buddy
had
suddenly
turned
convex
.
A
pot
belly
swelled
under
the
tight
white
nylon
shirt
and
his
cheeks
were
round
and
ruddy
as
marzipan
fruit
.
Even
his
laugh
sounded
plump
.
Buddy
's
eyes
met
mine
.
``
It
's
the
eating
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
stuff
us
day
after
day
and
then
just
make
us
lie
around
.
But
I
'm
allowed
out
on
walk
hours
now
,
so
do
n't
worry
,
I
'll
thin
down
in
a
couple
of
weeks
.
''
He
jumped
up
,
smiling
like
a
glad
host
.
``
Would
you
like
to
see
my
room
?
''
I
followed
Buddy
,
and
Mr.
Willard
followed
me
,
through
a
pair
of
swinging
doors
set
with
panes
of
frosted
glass
down
a
dim
,
liver-colored
corridor
smelling
of
floor
wax
and
Lysol
and
another
vaguer
odor
,
like
bruised
gardenias
.
Buddy
threw
open
a
brown
door
,
and
we
filed
into
the
narrow
room
.
A
lumpy
bed
,
shrouded
by
a
thin
white
spread
,
pencil-striped
with
blue
,
took
up
most
of
the
space
.
Next
to
it
stood
a
bed
table
with
a
pitcher
and
a
water
glass
and
the
silver
twig
of
a
thermometer
poking
up
from
a
jar
of
pink
disinfectant
.
A
second
table
,
covered
with
books
and
papers
and
off-kilter
clay
pots
--
baked
and
painted
,
but
not
glazed
--
squeezed
itself
between
the
bed
foot
and
the
closet
door
.
``
Well
,
''
Mr.
Willard
breathed
,
``
it
looks
comfortable
enough
.
''
Buddy
laughed
.
``
What
are
these
?
''
I
picked
up
a
clay
ashtray
in
the
shape
of
a
lilypad
,
with
the
veinings
carefully
drawn
in
yellow
on
a
murky
green
ground
.
Buddy
did
n't
smoke
.
``
That
's
an
ashtray
,
''
Buddy
said
.
``
It
's
for
you
.
''
I
put
the
tray
down
.
``
I
do
n't
smoke
.
''
``
I
know
,
''
Buddy
said
.
``
I
thought
you
might
like
it
,
though
.
''
``
Well
,
''
Mr.
Willard
rubbed
one
papery
lip
against
another
.
``
I
guess
I
'll
be
getting
on
.
I
guess
I
'll
be
leaving
you
two
young
people
.
.
.
''
``
Fine
,
Dad
.
You
be
getting
on
.
''
I
was
surprised
.
I
had
thought
Mr.
Willard
was
going
to
stay
the
night
before
driving
me
back
the
next
day
.
``
Shall
I
come
too
?
''
``
No
,
no
.
''
Mr.
Willard
peeled
a
few
bills
from
his
wallet
and
handed
them
to
Buddy
.
``
See
that
Esther
gets
a
comfortable
seat
on
the
train
.
She
'll
stay
a
day
or
so
,
maybe
.
''
Buddy
escorted
his
father
to
the
door
.
I
felt
Mr.
Willard
had
deserted
me
.
I
thought
he
must
have
planned
it
all
along
,
but
Buddy
said
no
,
his
father
simply
could
n't
stand
the
sight
of
sickness
and
especially
his
own
son
's
sickness
,
because
he
thought
all
sickness
was
sickness
of
the
will
.
Mr.
Willard
had
never
been
sick
a
day
in
his
life
.
I
sat
down
on
Buddy
's
bed
.
There
simply
was
n't
anywhere
else
to
sit
.
Buddy
rummaged
among
his
papers
in
a
businesslike
way
.
Then
he
handed
me
a
thin
,
gray
magazine
.
``
Turn
to
page
eleven
.
''
The
magazine
was
printed
somewhere
in
Maine
and
full
of
stenciled
poems
and
descriptive
paragraphs
separated
from
each
other
by
asterisks
.
On
page
eleven
I
found
a
poem
titled
``
Florida
Dawn
.
''
I
skipped
down
through
image
after
image
about
watermelon
lights
and
turtle-green
palms
and
shells
fluted
like
bits
of
Greek
architecture
.
``
Not
bad
.
''
I
thought
it
was
dreadful
.
``
Who
wrote
it
?
''
Buddy
asked
with
an
odd
,
pigeony
smile
.
My
eye
dropped
to
the
name
on
the
lower
right-hand
corner
of
the
page
.
B.
S.
Willard
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
Then
I
said
,
``
Of
course
I
know
,
Buddy
.
You
wrote
it
.
''
Buddy
edged
over
to
me
.
I
edged
back
.
I
have
very
little
knowledge
about
TB
,
but
it
seemed
to
me
an
extremely
sinister
disease
,
the
way
it
went
on
so
invisibly
.
I
thought
Buddy
might
well
be
sitting
in
his
own
little
murderous
aura
of
TB
germs
.
``
Do
n't
worry
,
''
Buddy
kughed
.
``
I
'm
not
positive
.
''
``
Positive
?
''
``
You
ca
n't
catch
anything
.
''
Buddy
stopped
for
a
breath
,
the
way
you
do
in
the
middle
of
climbing
something
very
steep
.
``
I
want
to
ask
you
a
question
.
''
He
had
a
disquieting
new
habit
of
boring
into
my
eyes
with
his
look
as
if
actually
bent
on
piercing
my
head
,
the
better
to
analyze
what
went
on
inside
it
.
``
I
'd
thought
of
asking
it
by
letter
.
''
I
had
a
fleeting
vision
of
a
pale
blue
envelope
with
a
Yale
crest
on
the
back
flap
.
``
But
then
I
decided
it
would
be
better
if
I
waited
until
you
came
up
,
so
I
could
ask
you
in
person
.
''
He
paused
.
``
Well
,
do
n't
you
want
to
know
what
it
is
?
''
``
What
?
''
I
said
in
a
small
,
unpromising
voice
.
Buddy
sat
down
beside
me
.
He
put
his
arm
around
my
waist
and
brushed
the
hair
from
my
ear
.
I
did
n't
move
.
Then
I
heard
him
whisper
,
``
How
would
you
like
to
be
Mrs
.
Buddy
Willard
?
''
I
had
an
awful
impulse
to
laugh
.
I
thought
how
that
question
would
have
bowled
me
over
at
any
time
in
my
five-
or
six-year
period
of
adoring
Buddy
Willard
from
a
distance
.
Buddy
saw
me
hesitate
.
``
Oh
,
I
'm
in
no
shape
now
,
I
know
,
''
he
said
quickly
.
``
I
'm
still
on
P.A.S
.
and
I
may
yet
lose
a
rib
or
two
,
but
I
'll
be
back
at
med
school
by
next
fall
.
A
year
from
this
spring
at
the
latest
.
.
.
''
``
I
think
I
should
tell
you
something
,
Buddy
.
''
``
I
know
,
''
Buddy
said
stiffly
.
``
You
've
met
someone
.
''
``
No
,
it
's
not
that
.
''
``
What
is
it
,
then
?
''
``
I
'm
never
going
to
get
married
.
''
``
You
're
crazy
.
''
Buddy
brightened
.
``
You
'll
change
your
mind
.
''
``
No
.
My
mind
's
made
up
.
''
But
Buddy
just
went
on
looking
cheerful
.
``
Remember
,
''
I
said
,
``
that
time
you
hitchhiked
back
to
college
with
me
after
Skit
Night
?
''
``
I
remember
.
''
``
Remember
how
you
asked
me
where
would
I
like
to
live
best
,
the
country
or
the
city
?
''
``
And
you
said
.
.
.
''
``
And
I
said
I
wanted
to
live
in
the
country
and
in
the
city
both
?
''
Buddy
nodded
.
``
And
you
,
''
I
continued
with
sudden
force
,
``
laughed
and
said
I
had
the
perfect
setup
of
a
true
neurotic
and
that
that
question
came
from
some
questionnaire
you
'd
had
in
psychology
class
that
week
?
''
Buddy
's
smile
dimmed
.
``
Well
,
you
were
right
.
I
am
neurotic
.
I
could
never
settle
down
in
either
the
country
or
the
city
.
''
``
You
could
live
between
them
,
''
Buddy
suggested
helpfully
.
``
Then
you
could
go
to
the
city
sometimes
and
to
the
country
sometimes
.
''
``
Well
,
what
's
so
neurotic
about
that
?
''
Buddy
did
n't
answer
.
``
Well
?
''
I
rapped
out
,
thinking
,
You
ca
n't
coddle
these
sick
people
,
it
's
the
worst
thing
for
them
,
it
'll
spoil
them
to
bits
.
``
Nothing
,
''
Buddy
said
in
a
pale
,
still
voice
.
``
Neurotic
,
ha
!
''
I
let
out
a
scornful
laugh
.
``
If
neurotic
is
wanting
two
mutually
exclusive
things
at
one
and
the
same
time
,
then
I
'm
neurotic
as
hell
.
I
'll
be
flying
back
and
forth
between
one
mutually
exclusive
thing
and
another
for
the
rest
of
my
days
.
''
Buddy
put
his
hand
on
mine
.
``
Let
me
fly
with
you
.
''
I
stood
at
the
top
of
the
ski
slope
on
Mount
Pisgah
,
looking
down
.
I
had
no
business
to
be
up
there
.
I
had
never
skied
before
in
my
life
.
Still
,
I
thought
I
would
enjoy
the
view
while
I
had
the
chance
.
At
my
left
,
the
rope
tow
deposited
skier
after
skier
on
the
snowy
summit
which
,
packed
by
much
crossing
and
recrossing
and
slightly
melted
in
the
noon
sun
,
had
hardened
to
the
consistency
and
polish
of
glass
.
The
cold
air
punished
my
lungs
and
sinuses
to
a
visionary
clearness
.
On
every
side
of
me
the
red
and
blue
and
white
jacketed
skiers
tore
away
down
the
blinding
slope
like
fugitive
bits
of
an
American
flag
.
From
the
foot
of
the
ski
run
,
the
imitation
log
cabin
lodge
piped
its
popular
songs
into
the
overhang
of
silence
.
Gazing
down
on
the
Jungfrau
From
our
chalet
for
two
.
.
.
The
lilt
and
boom
threaded
by
me
like
an
invisible
rivulet
in
a
desert
of
snow
.
One
careless
,
superb
gesture
,
and
I
would
be
hurled
into
motion
down
the
slope
toward
the
small
khaki
spot
in
the
sidelines
,
among
the
spectators
,
which
was
Buddy
Willard
.
All
morning
Buddy
had
been
teaching
me
how
to
ski
.
First
,
Buddy
borrowed
skis
and
ski
poles
from
a
friend
of
his
in
the
village
,
and
ski
boots
from
a
doctor
's
wife
whose
feet
were
only
one
size
larger
than
my
own
,
and
a
red
ski
jacket
from
a
student
nurse
.
His
persistence
in
the
face
of
mulishness
was
astounding
.
Then
I
remembered
that
at
medical
school
Buddy
had
won
a
prize
for
persuading
the
most
relatives
of
dead
people
to
have
their
dead
ones
cut
up
whether
they
needed
it
or
not
,
in
the
interests
of
science
.
I
forget
what
the
prize
was
,
but
I
could
just
see
Buddy
in
his
white
coat
with
his
stethoscope
sticking
out
of
a
side
pocket
like
part
of
his
anatomy
,
smiling
and
bowing
and
talking
those
numb
,
dumb
relatives
into
signing
the
postmortem
papers
.
Next
,
Buddy
borrowed
a
car
from
his
own
doctor
,
who
'd
had
TB
himself
and
was
very
understanding
,
and
we
drove
off
as
the
buzzer
for
walk
hour
rasped
along
the
sunless
sanatorium
corridors
.
Buddy
had
never
skied
before
either
,
but
he
said
that
the
elementary
principles
were
quite
simple
,
and
as
he
'd
often
watched
the
ski
instructors
and
their
pupils
he
could
teach
me
all
I
'd
need
to
know
.
For
the
first
half
hour
I
obediently
herringboned
up
a
small
slope
,
pushed
off
with
my
poles
and
coasted
straight
down
.
Buddy
seemed
pleased
with
my
progress
.
``
That
's
fine
,
Esther
,
''
he
observed
,
as
I
negotiated
my
slope
for
the
twentieth
time
.
``
Now
let
's
try
you
on
the
rope
tow
.
''
I
stopped
in
my
tracks
,
flushed
and
panting
.
``
But
Buddy
,
I
do
n't
know
how
to
zigzag
yet
.
All
those
people
coming
down
from
the
top
know
how
to
zigzag
.
''
``
Oh
,
you
need
only
go
halfway
.
Then
you
wo
n't
gain
very
much
momentum
.
''
And
Buddy
accompanied
me
to
the
rope
tow
and
showed
me
how
to
let
the
rope
run
through
my
hands
,
and
then
told
me
to
close
my
fingers
round
it
and
go
up
.
It
never
occurred
to
me
to
say
no
.
I
wrapped
my
fingers
around
the
rough
,
bruising
snake
of
a
rope
that
slithered
through
them
,
and
went
up
.
But
the
rope
dragged
me
,
wobbling
and
balancing
,
so
rapidly
I
could
n't
hope
to
dissociate
myself
from
it
halfway
.
There
was
a
skier
in
front
of
me
and
a
skier
behind
me
,
and
I
'd
have
been
knocked
over
and
stuck
full
of
skis
and
poles
the
minute
I
let
go
,
and
I
did
n't
want
to
make
trouble
,
so
I
hung
quietly
on
.
At
the
top
,
though
,
I
had
second
thoughts
.
Buddy
singled
me
out
,
hesitating
there
in
the
red
jacket
.
His
arms
chopped
the
air
like
khaki
windmills
.
Then
I
saw
he
was
signaling
me
to
come
down
a
path
that
had
opened
in
the
middle
of
the
weaving
skiers
.
But
as
I
poised
,
uneasy
,
with
a
dry
throat
,
the
smooth
white
path
from
my
feet
to
his
feet
blurred
.
A
skier
crossed
it
from
the
left
,
another
crossed
it
from
the
right
,
and
Buddy
's
arms
went
on
waving
feebly
as
antennae
from
the
other
side
of
a
field
swarming
with
tiny
moving
animalcules
like
germs
,
or
bent
,
bright
exclamation
marks
.
I
looked
up
from
that
churning
amphitheater
to
the
view
beyond
it
.
The
great
,
gray
eye
of
the
sky
looked
back
at
me
,
its
mist-shrouded
sun
focusing
all
the
white
and
silent
distances
that
poured
from
every
point
of
the
compass
,
hill
after
pale
hill
,
to
stall
at
my
feet
.
The
interior
voice
nagging
me
not
to
be
a
fool
--
to
save
my
skin
and
take
off
my
skis
and
walk
down
,
camouflaged
by
the
scrub
pines
bordering
the
slope
--
fled
like
a
disconsolate
mosquito
.
The
thought
that
I
might
kill
myself
formed
in
my
mind
coolly
as
a
tree
or
a
flower
.
I
measured
the
distance
to
Buddy
with
my
eye
.
His
arms
were
folded
,
now
,
and
he
seemed
of
a
piece
with
the
split-rail
fence
behind
him
--
numb
,
brown
and
inconsequential
.
Edging
to
the
rim
of
the
hilltop
,
I
dug
the
spikes
of
my
poles
into
the
snow
and
pushed
myself
into
a
flight
I
knew
I
could
n't
stop
by
skill
or
any
belated
access
of
will
.
I
aimed
straight
down
.
A
keen
wind
that
had
been
hiding
itself
struck
me
full
in
the
mouth
and
raked
the
hair
back
horizontal
on
my
head
.
I
was
descending
,
but
the
white
sun
rose
no
higher
.
It
hung
over
the
suspended
waves
of
the
hills
,
an
insentient
pivot
without
which
the
world
would
not
exist
.
A
small
,
answering
point
in
my
own
body
flew
toward
it
.
I
felt
my
lungs
inflate
with
the
inrush
of
scenery
--
air
,
mountains
,
trees
,
people
.
I
thought
,
``
This
is
what
it
is
to
be
happy
.
''
I
plummeted
down
past
the
zigzaggers
,
the
students
,
the
experts
,
through
year
after
year
of
doubleness
and
smiles
and
compromise
,
into
my
own
past
.
People
and
trees
receded
on
either
hand
like
the
dark
sides
of
a
tunnel
as
I
hurtled
on
to
the
still
,
bright
point
at
the
end
of
it
,
the
pebble
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
,
the
white
sweet
baby
cradled
in
its
mother
's
belly
.
My
teeth
crunched
a
gravelly
mouthful
.
Ice
water
seeped
down
my
throat
.
Buddy
's
face
hung
over
me
,
near
and
huge
,
like
a
distracted
planet
.
Other
faces
showed
themselves
up
in
back
of
his
.
Behind
him
,
black
dots
swarmed
on
a
plane
of
whiteness
.
Piece
by
piece
,
as
at
the
strokes
of
a
dull
godmother
's
wand
,
the
old
world
sprang
back
into
position
.
``
You
were
doing
fine
,
''
a
familiar
voice
informed
my
ear
,
``
until
that
man
stepped
into
your
path
.
''
People
were
unfastening
my
bindings
and
collecting
my
ski
poles
from
where
they
poked
skyward
,
askew
,
in
their
separate
snowbanks
.
The
lodge
fence
propped
itself
at
my
back
.
Buddy
bent
to
pull
off
my
boots
and
the
several
pairs
of
white
wool
socks
that
padded
them
.
His
plump
hand
shut
on
my
left
foot
,
then
inched
up
my
ankle
,
closing
and
probing
,
as
if
feeling
for
a
concealed
weapon
.
A
dispassionate
white
sun
shone
at
the
summit
of
the
sky
.
I
wanted
to
hone
myself
on
it
till
I
grew
saintly
and
thin
and
essential
as
the
blade
of
a
knife
.
``
I
'm
going
up
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
'm
going
to
do
it
again
.
''
``
No
,
you
're
not
.
''
A
queer
,
satisfied
expression
came
over
Buddy
's
face
.
``
No
,
you
're
not
,
''
he
repeated
with
a
final
smile
.
``
Your
leg
's
broken
in
two
places
.
You
'll
be
stuck
in
a
cast
for
months
.
''
Nine
``
I
'm
so
GLAD
THEY
'RE
GOING
TO
DIE
.
''
Hilda
arched
her
cat-limbs
in
a
yawn
,
buried
her
head
in
her
arms
on
the
conference
table
and
went
back
to
sleep
.
A
wisp
of
bilious
green
straw
perched
on
her
brow
like
a
tropical
bird
.
Bile
green
.
They
were
promoting
it
for
fall
,
only
Hilda
,
as
usual
,
was
half
a
year
ahead
of
time
.
Bile
green
with
black
,
bile
green
with
white
,
bile
green
with
nile
green
,
its
kissing
cousin
.
Fashion
blurbs
,
silver
and
full
of
nothing
,
sent
up
their
fishy
bubbles
in
my
brain
.
They
surfaced
with
a
hollow
pop
.
I
'm
so
glad
they
're
going
to
die
.
I
cursed
the
luck
that
had
timed
my
arrival
in
the
hotel
cafeteria
to
coincide
with
Hilda
's
.
After
a
late
night
I
felt
too
dull
to
think
up
the
excuse
that
would
take
me
back
to
my
room
for
the
glove
,
the
handkerchief
,
the
umbrella
,
the
notebook
I
forgot
.
My
penalty
was
the
long
,
dead
walk
from
the
frosted
glass
doors
of
the
Amazon
to
the
strawberry-
marble
slab
of
our
entry
on
Madison
Avenue
.
Hilda
moved
like
a
mannequin
the
whole
way
.
``
That
's
a
lovely
hat
,
did
you
make
it
?
''
I
half
expected
Hilda
to
turn
on
me
and
say
,
``
You
sound
sick
,
''
but
she
only
extended
and
then
retracted
her
swanny
neck
.
``
Yes
.
''
The
night
before
I
'd
seen
a
play
where
the
heroine
was
possessed
by
a
dybbuk
,
and
when
the
dybbuk
spoke
from
her
mouth
its
voice
sounded
so
cavernous
and
deep
you
could
n't
tell
whether
it
was
a
man
or
a
woman
.
Well
,
Hilda
's
voice
sounded
just
like
the
voice
of
that
dybbuk
.
She
stared
at
her
reflection
in
the
glossed
shop
windows
as
if
to
make
sure
,
moment
by
moment
,
that
she
contained
to
exist
.
The
silence
between
us
was
so
profound
I
thought
part
of
it
must
be
my
fault
.
So
I
said
,
``
Is
n't
it
awful
about
the
Rosenbergs
?
''
The
Rosenbergs
were
to
be
electrocuted
late
that
night
.
``
Yes
!
''
Hilda
said
,
and
at
last
I
felt
I
had
touched
a
human
string
in
the
cat
's
cradle
of
her
heart
.
It
was
only
as
the
two
of
us
waited
for
the
others
in
the
tomblike
morning
gloom
of
the
conference
room
that
Hilda
amplified
that
Yes
of
hers
.
``
It
's
awful
such
people
should
be
alive
.
''
She
yawned
then
,
and
her
pale
orange
mouth
opened
on
a
large
darkness
.
Fascinated
,
I
stared
at
the
blind
cave
behind
her
face
until
the
two
lips
met
and
moved
and
the
dybbuk
spoke
out
of
its
hiding
place
,
``
I
'm
so
glad
they
're
going
to
die
.
''
``
Come
on
,
give
us
a
smile
.
''
I
sat
on
the
pink
velvet
loveseat
in
Jay
Cee
's
office
,
holding
a
paper
rose
and
facing
the
magazine
photographer
.
I
was
the
last
of
the
twelve
to
have
my
picture
taken
.
I
had
tried
concealing
myself
in
the
powder
room
,
but
it
did
n't
work
.
Betsy
had
spied
my
feet
under
the
doors
.
I
did
n't
want
my
picture
taken
because
I
was
going
to
cry
.
I
did
n't
know
why
I
was
going
to
cry
,
but
I
knew
that
if
anybody
spoke
to
me
or
looked
at
me
too
closely
the
tears
would
fly
out
of
my
eyes
and
the
sobs
would
fly
out
of
my
throat
and
I
'd
cry
for
a
week
.
I
could
feel
the
tears
brimming
and
sloshing
in
me
like
water
in
a
glass
that
is
unsteady
and
too
full
This
was
the
last
round
of
photographs
before
the
magazine
went
to
press
and
we
returned
to
Tulsa
or
Biloxi
or
Teaneck
or
Coos
Bay
or
wherever
we
'd
come
from
,
and
we
were
supposed
to
be
photographed
with
props
to
show
what
we
wanted
to
be
.
Betsy
held
an
ear
of
corn
to
show
she
wanted
to
be
a
farmer
's
wife
,
and
Hilda
held
the
bald
,
faceless
head
of
a
hatmaker
's
dummy
to
show
she
wanted
to
design
hats
,
and
Doreen
held
a
gold-embroidered
sari
to
show
she
wanted
to
be
a
social
worker
in
India
(
she
did
n't
really
,
she
told
me
,
she
only
wanted
to
get
her
hands
on
a
sari
)
.
When
they
asked
me
what
I
wanted
to
be
I
said
I
did
n't
know
.
``
Oh
,
sure
you
know
,
''
the
photographer
said
.
``
She
wants
,
''
said
Jay
Cee
wittily
,
``
to
be
everything
.
''
I
said
I
wanted
to
be
a
poet
.
Then
they
scouted
about
for
something
for
me
to
hold
.
Jay
Cee
suggested
a
book
of
poems
,
but
the
photographer
said
no
,
that
was
too
obvious
.
It
should
be
something
that
showed
what
inspired
the
poems
.
Finally
Jay
Cee
undipped
the
single
,
long-stemmed
paper
rose
from
her
latest
hat
.
The
photographer
fiddled
with
his
hot
white
lights
.
``
Show
us
how
happy
it
makes
you
to
write
a
poem
.
''
I
stared
through
the
frieze
of
rubber-plant
leaves
in
Jay
Cee
's
window
to
the
blue
sky
beyond
.
A
few
stagey
cloud
puffs
were
traveling
from
right
to
left
.
I
fixed
my
eyes
on
the
largest
cloud
,
as
if
,
when
it
passed
out
of
sight
,
I
might
have
the
good
luck
to
pass
with
it
.
I
felt
it
was
very
important
to
keep
the
line
of
my
mouth
level
.
``
Give
us
a
smile
.
''
At
last
,
obediently
,
like
the
mouth
of
a
ventriloquist
's
dummy
,
my
own
mouth
started
to
quirk
up
.
``
Hey
,
''
the
photographer
protested
,
with
sudden
foreboding
,
``
you
look
like
you
're
going
to
cry
.
''
I
could
n't
stop
.
I
buried
my
face
in
the
pink
velvet
facade
of
Jay
Cee
's
loveseat
and
with
immense
relief
the
salt
tears
and
miserable
noises
that
had
been
prowling
around
in
me
all
morning
burst
out
into
the
room
.
When
I
lifted
my
head
,
the
photographer
had
vanished
.
Jay
Cee
had
vanished
as
well
.
I
felt
limp
and
betrayed
,
like
the
skin
shed
by
a
terrible
animal
.
It
was
a
relief
to
be
free
of
the
animal
,
but
it
seemed
to
have
taken
my
spirit
with
it
,
and
everything
else
it
could
lay
its
paws
on
.
I
fumbled
in
my
pocketbook
for
the
gilt
compact
with
the
mascara
and
the
mascara
brush
and
the
eyeshadow
and
the
three
lipsticks
and
the
side
mirror
.
The
face
that
peered
back
at
me
seemed
to
be
peering
from
the
grating
of
a
prison
cell
after
a
prolonged
beating
.
It
looked
bruised
and
puffy
and
all
the
wrong
colors
.
It
was
a
face
that
needed
soap
and
water
and
Christian
tolerance
.
I
started
to
paint
it
with
small
heart
.
Jay
Cee
breezed
back
after
a
decent
interval
with
an
armful
of
manuscripts
.
``
These
'll
amuse
you
,
''
she
said
.
``
Have
a
good
read
.
''
Every
morning
a
snowy
avalanche
of
manuscripts
swelled
the
dust-gray
piles
in
the
office
of
the
Fiction
Editor
.
Secretly
,
in
studies
and
attics
and
schoolrooms
all
over
America
,
people
must
be
writing
.
Say
someone
or
other
finished
a
manuscript
every
minute
;
in
five
minutes
that
would
be
five
manuscripts
stacked
on
the
Fiction
Editor
's
desk
.
Within
the
hour
there
would
be
sixty
,
crowding
each
other
onto
the
floor
.
And
in
a
year
.
.
.
I
smiled
,
seeing
a
pristine
,
imaginary
manuscript
floating
in
mid-air
,
with
Esther
Greenwood
typed
in
the
upper-right-hand
corner
.
After
my
month
on
the
magazine
I
'd
applied
for
a
summer
school
course
with
a
famous
writer
where
you
sent
in
the
manuscript
of
a
story
and
he
read
it
and
said
whether
you
were
good
enough
to
be
admitted
into
his
class
.
Of
course
,
it
was
a
very
small
class
,
and
I
had
sent
in
my
story
a
long
time
ago
and
had
n't
heard
from
the
writer
yet
,
but
I
was
sure
I
'd
find
the
letter
of
acceptance
waiting
on
the
mail
table
at
home
.
I
decided
I
'd
surprise
Jay
Cee
and
send
in
a
couple
of
the
stories
I
wrote
in
this
class
under
a
pseudonym
.
Then
one
day
the
Fiction
Editor
would
come
in
to
Jay
Cee
personally
and
plop
the
stories
down
on
her
desk
and
say
,
``
Here
's
something
a
cut
above
the
usual
,
''
and
Jay
Cee
would
agree
and
accept
them
and
ask
the
author
to
lunch
and
it
would
be
me
.
``
Honestly
,
''
Doreen
said
,
``
this
one
'll
be
different
''
``
Tell
me
about
him
,
''
I
said
stonily
.
``
He
's
from
Peru
.
''
``
They
're
squat
,
''
I
said
.
``
They
're
ugly
as
Aztecs
.
''
``
No
,
no
,
no
,
sweetie
,
I
've
already
met
him
.
''
We
were
sitting
on
my
bed
in
a
mess
of
dirty
cotton
dresses
and
laddered
nylons
and
gray
underwear
,
and
for
ten
minutes
Doreen
had
been
trying
to
persuade
me
to
go
to
a
country
club
dance
with
a
friend
of
somebody
Lenny
knew
which
,
she
insisted
,
was
a
very
different
thing
from
a
friend
of
Lenny
's
,
but
as
I
was
catching
the
eight
o'clock
train
home
the
next
morning
I
felt
I
should
make
some
attempt
to
pack
I
also
had
a
dim
idea
that
if
I
walked
the
streets
of
New
York
by
myself
all
night
something
of
the
city
's
mystery
and
magnificence
might
rub
off
on
to
me
at
last
But
I
gave
it
up
.
It
was
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
for
me
to
decide
to
do
anything
in
those
last
days
.
And
when
I
eventually
did
decide
to
do
something
,
such
as
packing
a
suitcase
,
I
only
dragged
all
my
grubby
,
expensive
clothes
out
of
the
bureau
and
the
closet
and
spread
them
on
the
chairs
and
the
bed
and
the
floor
and
then
sat
and
stared
at
them
,
utterly
perplexed
.
They
seemed
to
have
a
separate
,
mulish
identity
of
their
own
that
refused
to
be
washed
and
folded
and
stowed
.
``
It
's
these
clothes
,
''
I
told
Doreen
.
``
I
just
ca
n't
face
these
clothes
when
I
come
back
.
''
``
That
's
easy
.
''
And
in
her
beautiful
,
one-track
way
,
Doreen
started
to
snatch
up
slips
and
stockings
and
the
elaborate
strapless
bra
,
full
of
steel
springs
--
a
free
gift
from
the
Primrose
Corset
Company
,
which
I
'd
never
had
the
courage
to
wear
--
and
finally
,
one
by
one
,
the
sad
array
of
queerly
cut
forty-dollar
dresses
.
.
.
``
Hey
,
leave
that
one
out
.
I
'm
wearing
it
.
''
Doreen
extricated
a
black
scrap
from
her
bundle
and
dropped
it
in
my
lap
.
Then
,
snowballing
the
rest
of
the
clothes
into
one
soft
,
conglomerate
mass
,
she
stuffed
them
out
of
sight
under
the
bed
.
Doreen
knocked
on
the
green
door
with
the
gold
knob
.
Scuffing
and
a
man
's
laugh
,
cut
short
,
sounded
from
inside
.
Then
a
tall
boy
in
shirtsleeves
and
a
blond
crewcut
inched
the
door
open
and
peered
out
.
``
Baby
!
''
he
roared
.
Doreen
disappeared
in
his
arms
.
I
thought
it
must
be
the
person
Lenny
knew
.
I
stood
quietly
in
the
doorway
in
my
black
sheath
and
my
black
stole
with
the
fringe
,
yellower
than
ever
,
but
expecting
less
.
``
I
am
an
observer
,
''
I
told
myself
,
as
I
watched
Doreen
being
handed
into
the
room
by
the
blond
boy
to
another
man
,
who
was
also
tall
,
but
dark
,
with
slightly
longer
hair
.
This
man
was
wearing
an
immaculate
white
suit
,
a
pale
blue
shirt
and
a
yellow
satin
tie
with
a
bright
stickpin
.
I
could
n't
take
my
eyes
off
that
stickpin
.
A
great
white
light
seemed
to
shoot
out
of
it
,
illuminating
the
room
.
Then
the
light
withdrew
into
itself
,
leaving
a
dewdrop
on
a
field
of
gold
.
I
put
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
.
``
That
's
a
diamond
,
''
somebody
said
,
and
a
lot
of
people
burst
out
laughing
.
My
nail
tapped
a
glassy
facet
``
Her
first
diamond
.
''
``
Give
it
to
her
,
Marco
.
''
Marco
bowed
and
deposited
the
stickpin
in
my
palm
.
It
dazzled
and
danced
with
light
like
a
heavenly
ice
cube
.
I
slipped
it
quickly
into
my
imitation
jet
bead
evening
bag
and
looked
around
.
The
faces
were
empty
as
plates
,
and
nobody
seemed
to
be
breathing
.
``
Fortunately
,
''
a
dry
,
hard
hand
encircled
my
upper
arm
,
``
I
am
escorting
the
lady
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
Perhaps
,
''
the
spark
in
Marco
's
eyes
extinguished
,
and
they
went
black
,
``
I
shall
perform
some
small
service
.
.
.
''
Somebody
laughed
.
``
.
.
.worthy
of
a
diamond
.
''
The
hand
round
my
arm
tightened
.
``
Ouch
!
''
Marco
removed
his
hand
.
I
looked
down
at
my
arm
.
A
fhumbprint
purpled
into
view
.
Marco
watched
me
.
Then
he
pointed
to
the
underside
of
my
arm
.
``
Look
there
.
''
I
looked
,
and
saw
four
,
faint
matching
prints
.
``
You
see
,
I
am
quite
serious
.
''
Marco
's
small
,
flickering
smile
reminded
me
of
a
snake
I
'd
teased
in
the
Bronx
Zoo
.
When
I
tapped
my
finger
on
the
stout
cage
glass
the
snake
had
opened
its
clockwork
jaws
and
seemed
to
smile
.
Then
it
struck
and
struck
and
struck
at
the
invisible
pane
till
I
moved
off
.
I
had
never
met
a
woman-hater
before
.
I
could
tell
Marco
was
a
woman-hater
,
because
in
spite
of
all
the
models
and
TV
starlets
in
the
room
that
night
he
paid
attention
to
nobody
but
me
.
Not
out
of
kindness
or
even
curiosity
,
but
because
I
'd
happened
to
be
dealt
to
him
,
like
a
playing
card
in
a
pack
of
identical
cards
.
A
man
in
the
country
club
band
stepped
up
to
the
mike
and
started
shaking
those
seedpod
rattles
that
mean
South
American
music
.
Marco
reached
for
my
hand
,
but
I
hung
on
to
my
fourth
daiquiri
and
stayed
put
.
I
'd
never
had
a
daiquiri
before
.
The
reason
I
had
a
daiquiri
was
because
Marco
ordered
it
for
me
,
and
I
felt
so
grateful
he
had
n't
asked
what
sort
of
drink
I
wanted
that
I
did
n't
say
a
word
,
I
just
drank
one
daiquiri
after
another
.
Marco
looked
at
me
.
``
No
,
''
I
said
.
``
What
do
you
mean
,
no
?
''
``
I
ca
n't
dance
to
that
kind
of
music
.
''
``
Do
n't
be
stupid
.
''
``
I
want
to
sit
here
and
finish
my
drink
.
''
Marco
bent
toward
me
with
a
tight
smile
,
and
in
one
swoop
my
drink
took
wing
and
landed
in
a
potted
palm
.
Then
Marco
gripped
my
hand
in
such
a
way
I
had
to
choose
between
following
him
on
to
the
floor
or
having
my
arm
torn
off
.
``
It
's
a
tango
.
''
Marco
maneuvered
me
out
among
the
dancers
.
``
I
love
tangos
.
''
``
I
ca
n't
dance
.
''
``
You
do
n't
have
to
dance
.
I
'll
do
the
dancing
.
''
Marco
hooked
an
arm
around
my
waist
and
jerked
me
up
against
his
dazzling
white
suit
.
Then
he
said
,
``
Pretend
you
are
drowning
.
''
I
shut
my
eyes
,
and
the
music
broke
over
me
like
a
rainstorm
.
Marco
's
leg
slid
forward
against
mine
and
my
leg
slid
back
and
I
seemed
to
be
riveted
to
him
,
limb
for
limb
,
moving
as
he
moved
,
without
any
will
or
knowledge
of
my
own
,
and
after
a
while
I
thought
,
``
It
does
n't
take
two
to
dance
,
it
only
takes
one
,
''
and
I
let
myself
blow
and
bend
like
a
tree
in
the
wind
.
``
What
did
I
tell
you
?
''
Marco
's
breath
scorched
my
ear
.
``
You
're
a
perfectly
respectable
dancer
.
''
I
began
to
see
why
woman-haters
could
make
such
fools
of
women
.
Woman-
haters
were
like
gods
:
invulnerable
and
chock-full
of
power
.
They
descended
,
and
then
they
disappeared
.
You
could
never
catch
one
.
After
the
South
American
music
there
was
an
interval
Marco
led
me
through
the
French
doors
into
the
garden
.
Lights
and
voices
spilled
from
the
ballroom
window
,
but
a
few
yards
beyond
the
darkness
drew
up
its
barricade
and
sealed
them
off
.
In
the
infinitesimal
glow
of
the
stars
,
the
trees
and
flowers
were
strewing
their
cool
odors
.
There
was
no
moon
.
The
box
hedges
shut
behind
us
.
A
deserted
golf
course
stretched
away
toward
a
few
hilly
clumps
of
trees
,
and
I
felt
the
whole
desolate
familiarity
of
the
scene
--
the
country
club
and
the
dance
and
the
lawn
with
its
single
cricket
.
I
did
n't
know
where
I
was
,
but
it
was
somewhere
in
the
wealthy
suburbs
of
New
York
.
Marco
produced
a
slim
cigar
and
a
silver
lighter
in
the
shape
of
a
bullet
.
He
set
the
cigar
between
his
lips
and
bent
over
the
small
flare
.
His
face
,
with
its
exaggerated
shadows
and
planes
of
light
,
looked
alien
and
pained
,
like
a
refugee
's
.
I
watched
him
.
``
Who
are
you
in
love
with
?
''
I
said
then
.
For
a
minute
Marco
did
n't
say
anything
,
he
simply
opened
his
mouth
and
breathed
out
a
blue
,
vaporous
ring
.
``
Perfect
!
''
he
laughed
.
The
ring
widened
and
blurred
,
ghost-pale
on
the
dark
air
.
Then
he
said
,
``
I
am
in
love
with
my
cousin
.
''
I
felt
no
surprise
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
marry
her
?
''
``
Impossible
.
''
``
Why
?
''
Marco
shrugged
.
``
She
's
my
first
cousin
.
She
's
going
to
be
a
nun
.
''
``
Is
she
beautiful
?
''
``
There
's
no
one
to
touch
her
.
''
``
Does
she
know
you
love
her
?
''
``
Of
course
.
''
I
paused
.
The
obstacle
seemed
unreal
to
me
.
``
If
you
love
her
,
''
I
said
,
``
you
'll
love
somebody
else
someday
.
''
Marco
dashed
his
cigar
underfoot
.
The
ground
soared
and
struck
me
with
a
soft
shock
.
Mud
squirmed
through
my
fingers
.
Marco
waited
until
I
half
rose
.
Then
he
put
both
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
flung
me
back
.
``
My
dress
.
.
.
''
``
Your
dress
!
''
The
mud
oozed
and
adjusted
itself
to
my
shoulder
blades
.
``
Your
dress
!
''
Marco
's
face
lowered
cloudily
over
mine
.
A
few
drops
of
spit
struck
my
lips
.
``
Your
dress
is
black
and
the
dirt
is
black
as
well
.
''
Then
he
threw
himself
face
down
as
if
he
would
grind
his
body
through
me
and
into
the
mud
.
``
It
's
happening
,
''
I
thought
.
``
It
's
happening
.
If
I
just
lie
here
and
do
nothing
it
will
happen
.
''
Marco
set
his
teeth
to
the
strap
at
my
shoulder
and
tore
my
sheath
to
the
waist
.
I
saw
the
glimmer
of
bare
skin
,
like
a
pale
veil
separating
two
bloody-minded
adversaries
.
``
Slut
!
''
The
words
hissed
by
my
ear
.
``
Slut
!
''
The
dust
cleared
,
and
I
had
a
full
view
of
the
battle
.
I
began
to
writhe
and
bite
.
Marco
weighed
me
to
the
earth
.
``
Slut
!
''
I
gouged
at
his
leg
with
the
sharp
heel
of
my
shoe
.
He
turned
,
fumbling
for
the
hurt
.
Then
I
fisted
my
fingers
together
and
smashed
them
at
his
nose
.
It
was
like
hitting
the
steel
plate
of
a
battleship
.
Marco
sat
up
.
I
began
to
cry
.
Marco
pulled
out
a
white
handkerchief
and
dabbed
his
nose
.
Blackness
,
like
ink
,
spread
over
the
pale
cloth
.
I
sucked
at
my
salty
knuckles
.
``
I
want
Doreen
.
''
Marco
stared
off
across
the
golf
links
.
``
I
want
Doreen
.
I
want
to
go
home
.
''
``
Sluts
,
all
sluts
.
''
Marco
seemed
to
be
talking
to
nimself
.
``
Yes
or
no
,
it
is
all
the
same
.
''
I
poked
Marco
's
shoulder
.
``
Where
's
Doreen
?
''
Marco
snorted
.
``
Go
to
the
parking
lot
.
Look
in
the
backs
of
all
the
cars
.
''
Then
he
spun
around
.
``
My
diamond
.
''
I
got
up
and
retrieved
my
stole
from
the
darkness
.
I
started
to
walk
off
.
Marco
sprang
to
his
feet
and
blocked
my
path
.
Then
,
deliberately
,
he
wiped
his
finger
under
his
bloody
nose
and
with
two
strokes
stained
my
cheeks
.
``
I
have
earned
my
diamond
with
this
blood
.
Give
it
to
me
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
where
it
is
.
''
Now
I
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
diamond
was
in
my
evening
bag
and
that
when
Marco
knocked
me
down
my
evening
bag
had
soared
,
like
a
night
bird
,
into
the
enveloping
darkness
.
I
began
to
think
I
would
lead
him
away
and
then
return
on
my
own
and
hunt
for
it
.
I
had
no
idea
what
a
diamond
that
size
would
buy
,
but
whatever
it
was
,
I
knew
it
would
be
a
lot
.
Marco
took
my
shoulders
in
both
hands
.
``
Tell
me
,
''
he
said
,
giving
each
word
equal
emphasis
.
``
Tell
me
,
or
I
'll
break
your
neck
.
''
Suddenly
I
did
n't
care
.
``
It
's
in
my
imitation
jet
bead
evening
bag
,
''
I
said
.
``
Somewhere
in
the
muck
.
''
I
left
Marco
on
his
hands
and
knees
,
scrabbling
in
the
darkness
for
another
,
smaller
darkness
that
hid
the
light
of
his
diamond
from
his
furious
eyes
.
Doreen
was
not
in
the
ballroom
nor
in
the
parking
lot
.
I
kept
to
the
fringe
of
the
shadows
so
nobody
would
notice
the
grass
plastered
to
my
dress
and
shoes
,
and
with
my
black
stole
I
covered
my
shoulders
and
bare
breasts
.
Luckily
for
me
,
the
dance
was
nearly
over
,
and
groups
of
people
were
leaving
and
coming
out
to
the
parked
cars
.
I
asked
at
one
car
after
another
until
finally
I
found
a
car
that
had
room
and
would
drop
me
in
the
middle
of
Manhattan
.
At
that
vague
hour
between
dark
and
dawn
,
the
sunroof
of
the
Amazon
was
deserted
.
Quiet
as
a
burglar
in
my
cornflower-sprigged
bathrobe
,
I
crept
to
the
edge
of
the
parapet
.
The
parapet
reached
almost
to
my
shoulders
,
so
I
dragged
a
folding
chair
from
the
stack
against
the
wall
,
opened
it
,
and
climbed
onto
the
precarious
seat
.
A
stiff
breeze
lifted
the
hair
from
my
head
.
At
my
feet
,
the
city
doused
its
lights
in
sleep
,
its
buildings
blackened
,
as
if
for
a
funeral
.
It
was
my
last
night
.
I
grasped
the
bundle
I
carried
and
pulled
at
a
pale
tail
.
A
strapless
elasticized
slip
which
,
in
the
course
of
wear
,
had
lost
its
elasticity
,
slumped
into
my
hand
.
I
waved
it
,
like
a
flag
of
truce
,
once
,
twice
.
.
.
The
breeze
caught
it
,
and
I
let
go
.
A
white
flake
floated
out
into
the
night
,
and
began
its
slow
descent
.
I
wondered
on
what
street
or
rooftop
it
would
come
to
rest
.
I
tugged
at
the
bundle
again
.
The
wind
made
an
effort
,
but
failed
,
and
a
batlike
shadow
sank
toward
the
roof
garden
of
the
penthouse
opposite
.
Piece
by
piece
,
I
fed
my
wardrobe
to
the
night
wind
,
and
flutteringly
,
like
a
loved
one
's
ashes
,
the
gray
scraps
were
ferried
off
,
to
settle
here
,
there
,
exactly
where
I
would
never
know
,
in
the
dark
heart
of
New
York
.
Ten
THE
FACE
IN
THE
MIRROR
looked
like
a
sick
Indian
.
I
dropped
the
compact
into
my
pocketbook
and
stared
out
of
the
train
window
.
Like
a
colossal
junkyard
,
the
swamps
and
back
lots
of
Connecticut
flashed
past
,
one
broken-down
fragment
bearing
no
relation
to
another
.
What
a
hotchpotch
the
world
was
!
I
glanced
down
at
my
unfamiliar
skirt
and
blouse
.
The
skirt
was
a
green
dirndl
with
tiny
black
,
white
and
electric-blue
shapes
swarming
across
it
,
and
it
stuck
out
like
a
lampshade
.
Instead
of
sleeves
,
the
white
eyelet
blouse
had
frills
at
the
shoulder
,
floppy
as
the
wings
of
a
new
angel
.
I
'd
forgotten
to
save
any
day
clothes
from
the
ones
I
let
fly
over
New
York
,
so
Betsy
had
traded
me
a
blouse
and
skirt
for
my
bathrobe
with
the
cornflowers
on
it
.
A
wan
reflection
of
myself
,
white
wings
,
brown
ponytail
and
all
,
ghosted
over
the
landscape
.
``
Pollyanna
Cowgirl
,
''
I
said
out
loud
.
A
woman
in
the
seat
opposite
looked
up
from
her
magazine
.
I
had
n't
,
at
the
last
moment
,
felt
like
washing
off
the
two
diagonal
lines
of
dried
blood
that
marked
my
cheeks
.
They
seemed
touching
,
and
rather
spectacular
,
and
I
thought
I
would
carry
them
around
with
me
,
like
the
relic
of
a
dead
lover
,
till
they
wore
off
of
their
own
accord
.
Of
course
,
if
I
smiled
or
moved
my
face
much
,
the
blood
would
flake
away
in
no
time
,
so
I
kept
my
face
immobile
,
and
when
I
had
to
speak
I
spoke
through
my
teeth
,
without
disturbing
my
lips
.
I
did
n't
really
see
why
people
should
look
at
me
.
Plenty
of
people
looked
queerer
than
I
did
.
My
gray
suitcase
rode
on
the
rack
over
my
head
,
empty
except
for
The
Thirty
Best
Short
Stories
of
the
Year
,
a
white
plastic
sunglasses
case
and
two
dozen
avocado
pears
,
a
parting
present
from
Doreen
.
The
pears
were
unripe
,
so
they
would
keep
well
,
and
whenever
I
lifted
my
suitcase
up
or
down
or
simply
carried
it
along
,
they
cannoned
from
one
end
to
the
other
with
a
special
little
thunder
of
their
own
.
``
Root
Wan
Twenny
Ate
!
''
the
conductor
bawled
.
The
domesticated
wilderness
of
pine
,
maple
and
oak
rolled
to
a
halt
and
stuck
in
the
frame
of
the
train
window
like
a
bad
picture
.
My
suitcase
grumbled
and
bumped
as
I
negotiated
the
long
aisle
.
I
stepped
from
the
air-conditioned
compartment
onto
the
station
platform
,
and
the
motherly
breath
of
the
suburbs
enfolded
me
.
It
smelt
of
lawn
sprinklers
and
station
wagons
and
tennis
rackets
and
dogs
and
babies
.
A
summer
calm
laid
its
soothing
hand
over
everything
,
like
death
.
My
mother
was
waiting
by
the
glove-gray
Chevrolet
.
``
Why
lovey
,
what
's
happened
to
your
face
?
''
``
Cut
myself
,
''
I
said
briefly
,
and
crawled
into
the
back
seat
after
my
suitcase
.
I
did
n't
want
her
staring
at
me
the
whole
way
home
.
The
upholstery
felt
slippery
and
clean
.
My
mother
climbed
behind
the
wheel
and
tossed
a
few
letters
into
my
lap
,
then
turned
her
back
The
car
purred
into
life
.
``
I
think
I
should
tell
you
right
away
,
''
she
said
,
and
I
could
see
bad
news
in
the
set
of
her
neck
,
``
you
did
n't
make
that
writing
course
.
''
The
air
punched
out
of
my
stomach
.
All
through
June
the
writing
course
stretched
before
me
like
a
bright
,
safe
bridge
over
the
dull
gulf
of
the
summer
.
Now
I
saw
it
totter
and
dissolve
,
and
a
body
in
a
white
blouse
and
green
skirt
plummet
into
the
gap
.
Then
my
mouth
shaped
itself
sourly
.
I
had
expected
it
.
I
slunk
down
on
the
middle
of
my
spine
,
my
nose
level
with
the
rim
of
the
window
,
and
watched
the
houses
of
outer
Boston
glide
by
.
As
the
houses
grew
more
familiar
I
slunk
still
lower
.
I
felt
it
was
very
important
not
to
be
recognized
.
The
gray
,
padded
car
roof
closed
over
my
head
like
the
roof
of
a
prison
van
,
and
the
white
,
shining
,
identical
clapboard
houses
with
their
interstices
of
well-groomed
green
proceeded
past
,
one
bar
after
another
in
a
large
but
escape-proof
cage
.
I
had
never
spent
a
summer
in
the
suburbs
before
.
The
soprano
screak
of
carriage
wheels
punished
my
ear
.
Sun
,
seeping
through
the
blinds
,
filled
the
bedroom
with
a
sulphurous
light
.
I
did
n't
know
how
long
I
had
slept
,
but
I
felt
one
big
twitch
of
exhaustion
.
The
twin
bed
next
to
mine
was
empty
and
unmade
.
At
seven
I
had
heard
my
mother
get
up
,
slip
into
her
clothes
and
tiptoe
out
of
the
room
.
Then
the
buzz
of
the
orange
squeezer
sounded
from
downstairs
,
and
the
smell
of
coffee
and
bacon
filtered
under
my
door
.
Then
the
sink
water
ran
from
the
tap
and
dishes
clinked
as
my
mother
dried
them
and
put
them
back
in
the
cupboard
.
Then
the
front
door
opened
and
shut
.
Then
the
car
door
opened
and
shut
,
and
the
motor
went
broom-broom
and
,
edging
off
with
a
crunch
of
gravel
,
faded
into
the
distance
.
My
mother
was
teaching
shorthand
and
typing
to
a
lot
of
city
college
girls
and
would
n't
be
home
till
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
.
The
carriage
wheels
screaked
past
again
.
Somebody
seemed
to
be
wheeling
a
baby
back
and
forth
under
my
window
.
I
slipped
out
of
bed
and
onto
the
rug
,
and
quietly
,
on
my
hands
and
knees
,
crawled
over
to
see
who
it
was
.
Ours
was
a
small
,
white
clapboard
house
set
in
the
middle
of
a
small
green
lawn
on
the
corner
of
two
peaceful
suburban
streets
,
but
in
spite
of
the
little
maple
trees
planted
at
intervals
around
our
property
,
anybody
passing
along
the
sidewalk
could
glance
up
at
the
second
story
windows
and
see
just
what
was
going
on
.
This
was
brought
home
to
me
by
our
next-door
neighbor
,
a
spiteful
woman
named
Mrs.
Ockenden
.
Mrs.
Ockenden
was
a
retired
nurse
who
had
just
married
her
third
husband
--
the
other
two
died
in
curious
circumstances
--
and
she
spent
an
inordinate
amount
of
time
peering
from
behind
the
starched
white
curtains
of
her
windows
.
She
had
called
my
mother
up
twice
about
me
--
once
to
report
that
I
had
been
sitting
in
front
of
the
house
for
an
hour
under
the
streetlight
and
kissing
somebody
in
a
blue
Plymouth
,
and
once
to
say
that
I
had
better
pull
the
blinds
down
in
my
room
,
because
she
had
seen
me
half-naked
getting
ready
for
bed
one
night
when
she
happened
to
be
out
walking
her
Scotch
terrier
.
With
great
care
,
I
raised
my
eyes
to
the
level
of
the
windowsill
.
A
woman
not
five
feet
tall
,
with
a
grotesque
,
protruding
stomach
,
was
wheeling
an
old
black
baby
carriage
down
the
street
.
Two
or
three
small
children
of
various
sizes
,
all
pale
,
with
smudgy
faces
and
bare
smudgy
knees
,
wobbled
along
in
the
shadow
of
her
skirts
.
A
serene
,
almost
religious
smile
lit
up
the
woman
's
face
.
Her
head
tilted
happily
back
,
like
a
sparrow
egg
perched
on
a
duck
egg
,
she
smiled
into
the
sun
.
I
knew
the
woman
well
It
was
Dodo
Conway
.
Dodo
Conway
was
a
Catholic
who
had
gone
to
Barnard
and
then
married
an
architect
who
had
gone
to
Columbia
and
was
also
a
Catholic
.
They
had
a
big
,
rambling
house
up
the
street
from
us
,
set
behind
a
morbid
facade
of
pine
trees
,
and
surrounded
by
scooters
,
tricycles
,
doll
carriages
,
toy
fire
trucks
,
baseball
bats
,
badminton
nets
,
croquet
wickets
,
hamster
cages
and
cocker
spaniel
puppies
--
the
whole
sprawling
paraphernalia
of
suburban
childhood
.
Dodo
interested
me
in
spite
of
myself
.
Her
house
was
unlike
all
the
others
in
our
neighborhood
in
its
size
(
it
was
much
bigger
)
and
its
color
(
the
second
story
was
constructed
of
dark
brown
clapboard
and
the
first
of
gray
stucco
,
studded
with
gray
and
purple
golfball-shaped
stones
)
,
and
the
pine
trees
completely
screened
it
from
view
,
which
was
considered
unsociable
in
our
community
of
adjoining
lawns
and
friendly
,
waist-high
hedges
.
Dodo
raised
her
six
children
--
and
would
no
doubt
raise
her
seventh
--
on
Rice
Krispies
,
peanut-butter-and-marshmallow
sandwiches
,
vanilla
ice
cream
and
gallon
upon
gallon
of
Hoods
milk
.
She
got
a
special
discount
from
the
local
milkman
.
Everybody
loved
Dodo
,
although
the
swelling
size
of
her
family
was
the
talk
of
the
neighborhood
.
The
older
people
around
,
like
my
mother
,
had
two
children
,
and
the
younger
,
more
prosperous
ones
had
four
,
but
nobody
but
Dodo
was
on
the
verge
of
a
seventh
.
Even
six
was
considered
excessive
,
but
then
,
everybody
said
,
of
course
Dodo
was
a
Catholic
.
I
watched
Dodo
wheel
the
youngest
Conway
up
and
down
.
She
seemed
to
be
doing
it
for
my
benefit
.
Children
made
me
sick
.
A
floorboard
creaked
,
and
I
ducked
down
again
,
just
as
Dodo
Conway
's
face
,
by
instinct
,
or
some
gift
of
supernatural
hearing
,
turned
on
the
little
pivot
of
its
neck
.
I
felt
her
gaze
pierce
through
the
white
clapboard
and
the
pink
wallpaper
roses
and
uncover
me
,
crouching
there
behind
the
silver
pickets
of
the
radiator
.
I
crawled
back
into
bed
and
pulled
the
sheet
over
my
head
.
But
even
that
did
n't
shut
out
the
light
,
so
I
buried
my
head
under
the
darkness
of
the
pillow
and
pretended
it
was
night
.
I
could
n't
see
the
point
of
getting
up
.
I
had
nothing
to
look
forward
to
.
After
a
while
I
heard
the
telephone
ringing
in
the
downstairs
hall
.
I
stuffed
the
pillow
into
my
ears
and
gave
myself
five
minutes
.
Then
I
lifted
my
head
from
its
bolt
hole
.
The
ringing
had
stopped
.
Almost
at
once
it
started
up
again
.
Cursing
whatever
friend
,
relative
or
stranger
had
sniffed
out
my
homecoming
,
I
padded
barefoot
downstairs
.
The
black
instrument
on
the
hall
table
trilled
its
hysterical
note
over
and
over
,
like
a
nervous
bird
.
I
picked
up
the
receiver
.
``
Hullo
,
''
I
said
,
in
a
low
,
disguised
voice
.
``
Hullo
,
Esther
,
what
's
the
matter
,
have
you
got
laryngitis
?
''
It
was
my
old
friend
Jody
,
calling
from
Cambridge
.
Jody
was
working
at
the
Coop
that
summer
and
taking
a
lunchtime
course
in
sociology
.
She
and
two
other
girls
from
my
college
had
rented
a
big
apartment
from
four
Harvard
law
students
,
and
I
'd
been
planning
to
move
in
with
them
when
my
writing
course
began
.
Jody
wanted
to
know
when
they
could
expect
me
.
``
I
'm
not
coming
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
did
n't
make
the
course
.
''
There
was
a
small
pause
.
``
He
's
an
ass
,
''
Jody
said
then
.
``
He
does
n't
know
a
good
thing
when
he
sees
it
.
''
``
My
sentiments
exactly
.
''
My
voice
sounded
strange
and
hollow
in
my
ears
.
``
Come
anyway
.
Take
some
other
course
.
''
The
notion
of
studying
German
or
abnormal
psychology
flitted
through
my
head
.
After
all
,
I
'd
saved
nearly
the
whole
of
my
New
York
salary
,
so
I
could
just
about
afford
it
But
the
hollow
voice
said
,
``
You
better
count
me
out
.
''
``
Well
,
''
Jody
began
,
``
there
's
this
other
girl
who
wanted
to
come
in
with
us
if
anybody
dropped
out
.
.
.
''
``
Fine
.
Ask
her
.
''
The
minute
I
hung
up
I
knew
I
should
have
said
I
would
come
.
One
morning
listening
to
Dodo
Conway
's
baby
carriage
would
drive
me
crazy
.
And
I
made
a
point
of
never
living
in
the
same
house
with
my
mother
for
more
than
a
week
.
I
reached
for
the
receiver
.
My
hand
advanced
a
few
inches
,
then
retreated
and
fell
limp
.
I
forced
it
toward
the
receiver
again
,
but
again
it
stopped
short
,
as
if
it
had
collided
with
a
pane
of
glass
.
I
wandered
into
the
dining
room
.
Propped
on
the
table
I
found
a
long
,
businesslike
letter
from
the
summer
school
and
a
thin
blue
letter
on
leftover
Yale
stationery
,
addressed
to
me
in
Buddy
Willard
's
lucid
hand
.
I
slit
open
the
summer
school
letter
with
a
knife
.
Since
I
was
n't
accepted
for
the
writing
course
,
it
said
,
I
could
choose
some
other
course
instead
,
but
I
should
call
in
to
the
Admissions
Office
that
same
morning
,
or
it
would
be
too
late
to
register
,
the
courses
were
almost
full
.
I
dialed
the
Admissions
Office
and
listened
to
the
zombie
voice
leave
a
message
that
Miss
Esther
Greenwood
was
canceling
all
arrangements
to
come
to
summer
school
Then
I
opened
Buddy
Willard
's
letter
.
Buddy
wrote
that
he
was
probably
falling
in
love
with
a
nurse
who
also
had
TB
,
but
his
mother
had
rented
a
cottage
in
the
Adirondacks
for
the
month
of
July
,
and
if
I
came
along
with
her
,
he
might
well
find
his
feeling
for
the
nurse
was
mere
infatuation
.
I
snatched
up
a
pencil
and
crossed
out
Buddy
's
message
.
Then
I
turned
the
letter
paper
over
and
on
the
opposite
side
wrote
that
I
was
engaged
to
a
simultaneous
interpreter
and
never
wanted
to
see
Buddy
again
as
I
did
not
want
to
give
my
children
a
hypocrite
for
a
father
.
I
stuck
the
letter
back
in
the
envelope
,
Scotch-taped
it
together
,
and
readdressed
it
to
Buddy
,
without
putting
on
a
new
stamp
.
I
thought
the
message
was
worth
a
good
three
cents
.
Then
I
decided
I
would
spend
the
summer
writing
a
novel
That
would
fix
a
lot
of
people
.
I
strolled
into
the
kitchen
,
dropped
a
raw
egg
into
a
teacup
of
raw
hamburger
,
mixed
it
up
and
ate
it
.
Then
I
set
up
the
card
table
on
the
screened
breezeway
between
the
house
and
the
garage
.
A
great
wallowing
bush
of
mock
orange
shut
off
the
view
of
the
street
in
front
,
the
house
wall
and
the
garage
wall
took
care
of
either
side
,
and
a
clump
of
birches
and
a
box
hedge
protected
me
from
Mrs.
Ockenden
at
the
back
.
I
counted
out
three
hundred
and
fifty
sheets
of
corrasable
bond
from
my
mother
's
stock
in
the
hall
closet
,
secreted
away
under
a
pile
of
old
felt
hats
and
clothes
brushes
and
woolen
scarves
.
Back
on
the
breezeway
,
I
fed
the
first
,
virgin
sheet
into
my
old
portable
and
rolled
it
up
.
From
another
,
distanced
mind
,
I
saw
myself
sitting
on
the
breezeway
,
surrounded
by
two
white
clapboard
walls
,
a
mock
orange
bush
and
a
clump
of
birches
and
a
box
hedge
,
small
as
a
doll
in
a
doll
's
house
.
A
feeling
of
tenderness
filled
my
heart
.
My
heroine
would
be
myself
,
only
in
disguise
.
She
would
be
called
Elaine
.
Elaine
.
I
counted
the
letters
on
my
fingers
.
There
were
six
letters
in
Esther
,
too
.
It
seemed
a
lucky
thing
.
Elaine
sat
on
the
breezeway
in
an
old
yellow
nightgown
of
her
mother
's
waiting
for
something
to
happen
.
It
was
a
sweltering
morning
in
July
,
and
drops
of
sweat
crawled
down
her
back
one
by
one
,
like
slow
insects
.
I
leaned
back
and
read
what
I
had
written
.
It
seemed
lively
enough
,
and
I
was
quite
proud
of
the
bit
about
the
drops
of
sweat
like
insects
,
only
I
had
the
dim
impression
I
'd
probably
read
it
somewhere
else
a
long
time
ago
.
I
sat
like
that
for
about
an
hour
,
trying
to
think
what
would
come
next
,
and
in
my
mind
,
the
barefoot
doll
in
her
mother
's
old
yellow
nightgown
sat
and
stared
into
space
as
well
.
``
Why
,
honey
,
do
n't
you
want
to
get
dressed
?
''
My
mother
took
care
never
to
tell
me
to
do
anything
.
She
would
only
reason
with
me
sweetly
,
like
one
intelligent
mature
person
with
another
.
``
It
's
almost
three
in
the
afternoon
.
''
``
I
'm
writing
a
novel
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
have
n't
got
time
to
change
out
of
this
and
change
into
that
.
''
I
lay
on
the
couch
on
the
breezeway
and
shut
my
eyes
.
I
could
hear
my
mother
clearing
the
typewriter
and
the
papers
from
the
card
table
and
laying
out
the
silver
for
supper
,
but
I
did
n't
move
.
Inertia
oozed
like
molasses
through
Elaine
's
limbs
.
That
's
what
it
must
feel
like
to
have
malaria
,
she
thought
.
At
any
rate
,
I
'd
be
lucky
if
I
wrote
a
page
a
day
.
Then
I
knew
what
the
trouble
was
.
I
needed
experience
.
How
could
I
write
about
life
when
I
'd
never
had
a
love
affair
or
a
baby
or
even
seen
anybody
die
?
A
girl
I
knew
had
just
won
a
prize
for
a
short
story
about
her
adventures
among
the
pygmies
in
Africa
.
How
could
I
compete
with
that
sort
of
thing
?
By
the
end
of
supper
my
mother
had
convinced
me
I
should
study
shorthand
in
the
evenings
.
Then
I
would
be
killing
two
birds
with
one
stone
,
writing
a
novel
and
learning
something
practical
as
well
.
I
would
also
be
saving
a
whole
lot
of
money
.
That
same
evening
,
my
mother
unearthed
an
old
blackboard
from
the
cellar
and
set
it
up
on
the
breezeway
.
Then
she
stood
at
the
blackboard
and
scribbled
little
curlicues
in
white
chalk
while
I
sat
in
a
chair
and
watched
.
At
first
I
felt
hopeful
.
I
thought
I
might
learn
shorthand
in
no
time
,
and
when
the
freckled
lady
in
the
Scholarships
Office
asked
me
why
I
had
n't
worked
to
earn
money
in
July
and
August
,
the
way
you
were
supposed
to
if
you
were
a
scholarship
girl
,
I
could
tell
her
I
had
taken
a
free
shorthand
course
instead
,
so
I
could
support
myself
right
after
college
.
The
only
thing
was
,
when
I
tried
to
picture
myself
in
some
job
,
briskly
jotting
down
line
after
line
of
shorthand
,
my
mind
went
blank
.
There
was
n't
one
job
I
felt
like
doing
where
you
used
shorthand
.
And
,
as
I
sat
there
and
watched
,
the
white
chalk
curlicues
blurred
into
senselessness
.
I
told
my
mother
I
had
a
terrible
headache
,
and
went
to
bed
.
An
hour
later
the
door
inched
open
,
and
she
crept
into
the
room
.
I
heard
the
whisper
of
her
clothes
as
she
undressed
.
She
climbed
into
bed
.
Then
her
breathing
grew
slow
and
regular
.
In
the
dim
light
of
the
streetlamp
that
filtered
through
the
drawn
blinds
,
I
could
see
the
pin
curls
on
her
head
glittering
like
a
row
of
little
bayonets
.
I
decided
I
would
put
off
the
novel
until
I
had
gone
to
Europe
and
had
a
lover
,
and
that
I
would
never
learn
a
word
of
shorthand
.
If
I
never
learned
shorthand
I
would
never
have
to
use
it
.
I
thought
I
would
spend
the
summer
reading
Ftnnegans
Wake
and
writing
my
thesis
.
Then
I
would
be
way
ahead
when
college
started
at
the
end
of
September
,
and
able
to
enjoy
my
last
year
instead
of
swotting
away
with
no
makeup
and
stringy
hair
,
on
a
diet
of
coffee
and
Benzedrine
,
the
way
most
of
the
seniors
taking
honors
did
,
until
they
finished
their
thesis
.
Then
I
thought
I
might
put
off
college
for
a
year
and
apprentice
myself
to
a
pottery
maker
.
Or
work
my
way
to
Germany
and
be
a
waitress
,
until
I
was
bilingual
.
Then
plan
after
plan
started
leaping
through
my
head
,
like
a
family
of
scatty
rabbits
.
I
saw
the
years
of
my
life
spaced
along
a
road
in
the
form
of
telephone
poles
,
threaded
together
by
wires
.
I
counted
one
,
two
,
three
.
.
.
nineteen
telephone
poles
,
and
then
the
wires
dangled
into
space
,
and
try
as
I
would
,
I
could
n't
see
a
single
pole
beyond
the
nineteenth
.
The
room
blued
into
view
,
and
I
wondered
where
the
night
had
gone
.
My
mother
turned
from
a
foggy
log
into
a
slumbering
,
middle-aged
woman
,
her
mouth
slightly
open
and
a
snore
raveling
from
her
throat
.
The
piggish
noise
irritated
me
,
and
for
a
while
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
only
way
to
stop
it
would
be
to
take
the
column
of
skin
and
sinew
from
which
it
rose
and
twist
it
to
silence
between
my
hands
.
I
feigned
sleep
until
my
mother
left
for
school
,
but
even
my
eyelids
did
n't
shut
out
the
light
.
They
hung
the
raw
,
red
screen
of
their
tiny
vessels
in
front
of
me
like
a
wound
.
I
crawled
between
the
mattress
and
the
padded
bedstead
and
let
the
mattress
fall
across
me
like
a
tombstone
.
It
felt
dark
and
safe
under
there
,
but
the
mattress
was
not
heavy
enough
.
It
needed
about
a
ton
more
weight
to
make
me
sleep
.
riverrun

and

of

to

,

us
by
a
commodius
vicus
of
recirculation
back
to
Howth
Castle
and
Environs
.
.
.
The
thick
book
made
an
unpleasant
dent
in
my
stomach
.
riverrun
,
past
Eve
and
Adam
's
.
.
.
I
thought
the
small
letter
at
the
start
might
mean
that
nothing
ever
really
began
all
new
,
with
a
capital
,
but
that
it
just
flowed
on
from
what
came
before
.
Eve
and
Adam
's
was
Adam
and
Eve
,
or
course
,
but
it
probably
signified
something
else
as
well
.
Maybe
it
was
a
pub
in
Dublin
.
My
eyes
sank
through
an
alphabet
soup
of
letters
to
the
long
word
in
the
middle
of
the
page
.
bababadalgharaghtakammmarronnkonnbronntonnerronnttionnthunntrovarrhoun
awnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk
!
I
counted
the
letters
.
There
were
exactly
a
hundred
of
them
.
I
thought
this
must
be
important
.
Why
should
there
be
a
hundred
letters
?
Haltingly
,
I
tried
the
word
aloud
.
It
sounded
like
a
heavy
wooden
object
falling
downstairs
,
boomp
boomp
boomp
,
step
after
step
.
Lifting
the
pages
of
the
book
,
I
let
them
fan
slowly
by
my
eyes
.
Words
,
dimly
familiar
but
twisted
all
awry
,
like
faces
in
a
funhouse
mirror
,
fled
past
,
leaving
no
impression
on
the
glassy
surface
of
my
brain
.
I
squinted
at
the
page
.
The
letters
grew
barbs
and
rams
'
horns
.
I
watched
them
separate
,
each
from
the
other
,
and
jiggle
up
and
down
in
a
silly
way
.
Then
they
associated
themselves
in
fantastic
,
untranslatable
shapes
,
like
Arabic
or
Chinese
.
I
decided
to
junk
my
thesis
.
I
decided
to
junk
the
whole
honors
program
and
become
an
ordinary
English
major
.
I
went
to
look
up
the
requirements
of
an
ordinary
English
major
at
my
college
.
There
were
lots
of
requirements
,
and
I
did
n't
have
half
of
them
.
One
of
the
requirements
was
a
course
in
the
eighteenth
century
.
I
hated
the
very
idea
of
the
eighteenth
century
,
with
all
those
smug
men
writing
tight
little
couplets
and
being
so
dead
keen
on
reason
.
So
I
'd
skipped
it
.
They
let
you
do
that
in
honors
,
you
were
much
freer
.
I
had
been
so
free
I
'd
spent
most
of
my
time
on
Dylan
Thomas
.
A
friend
of
mine
,
also
in
honors
,
had
managed
never
to
read
a
word
of
Shakespeare
;
but
she
was
a
real
expert
on
the
Four
Quartets
.
I
saw
how
impossible
and
embarrassing
it
would
be
for
me
to
try
to
switch
from
my
free
program
into
the
stricter
one
.
So
I
looked
up
the
requirements
for
English
majors
at
the
city
college
where
my
mother
taught
.
They
were
even
worse
.
You
had
to
know
Old
English
and
the
History
of
the
English
Language
and
a
representative
selection
of
all
that
had
been
written
from
Beowulf
to
the
present
day
.
This
surprised
me
.
I
had
always
looked
down
on
my
mother
's
college
,
as
it
was
coed
,
and
filled
with
people
who
could
n't
get
scholarships
to
the
big
eastern
colleges
.
Now
I
saw
that
the
stupidest
person
at
my
mother
's
college
knew
more
than
I
did
.
I
saw
they
would
n't
even
let
me
in
through
the
door
,
let
alone
give
me
a
large
scholarship
like
the
one
I
had
at
my
own
college
.
I
thought
I
'd
better
go
to
work
for
a
year
and
think
things
over
.
Maybe
I
could
study
the
eighteenth
century
in
secret
.
But
I
did
n't
know
shorthand
,
so
what
could
I
do
?
I
could
be
a
waitress
or
a
typist
.
But
I
could
n't
stand
the
idea
of
being
either
one
.
``
You
say
you
want
more
sleeping
pills
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
``
But
the
ones
I
gave
you
last
week
are
very
strong
.
''
``
They
do
n't
work
any
more
.
''
Teresa
's
large
,
dark
eyes
regarded
me
thoughtfully
.
I
could
hear
the
voices
of
her
three
children
in
the
garden
under
the
consulting-room
window
.
My
Aunt
Libby
had
married
an
Italian
,
and
Teresa
was
my
aunt
's
sister-in-law
and
our
family
doctor
.
I
liked
Teresa
.
She
had
a
gentle
,
intuitive
touch
.
I
thought
it
must
be
because
she
was
Italian
.
There
was
a
little
pause
.
``
What
seems
to
be
the
matter
?
''
Teresa
said
then
.
``
I
ca
n't
sleep
.
I
ca
n't
read
.
''
I
tried
to
speak
in
a
cool
,
calm
way
,
but
the
zombie
rose
up
in
my
throat
and
choked
me
off
.
I
turned
my
hands
palm
up
.
``
I
think
,
''
Teresa
tore
off
a
white
slip
from
her
prescription
pad
and
wrote
down
a
name
and
address
,
``
you
'd
better
see
another
doctor
I
know
.
He
'll
be
able
to
help
you
more
than
I
can
.
''
I
peered
at
the
writing
,
but
I
could
n't
read
it
.
``
Doctor
Gordon
,
''
Teresa
said
.
``
He
's
a
psychiatrist
.
''
Eleven
DOCTOR
GORDON
'S
WAITING
ROOM
was
hushed
and
beige
.
The
walls
were
beige
,
and
the
carpets
were
beige
,
and
the
upholstered
chairs
and
sofas
were
beige
.
There
were
no
mirrors
or
pictures
,
only
certificates
from
different
medical
schools
,
with
Doctor
Gordon
's
name
in
Latin
,
hung
about
the
walls
.
Pale
green
loopy
ferns
and
spiked
leaves
of
a
much
darker
green
filled
the
ceramic
pots
on
the
end
table
and
the
coffee
table
and
the
magazine
table
.
At
first
I
wondered
why
the
room
felt
so
safe
.
Then
I
realized
it
was
because
there
were
no
windows
.
The
air-conditioning
made
me
shiver
.
I
was
still
wearing
Betsy
's
white
blouse
and
dirndl
skirt
.
They
drooped
a
bit
now
,
as
I
had
n't
washed
them
in
my
three
weeks
at
home
.
The
sweaty
cotton
gave
off
a
sour
but
friendly
smell
.
I
had
n't
washed
my
hair
for
three
weeks
,
either
.
I
had
n't
slept
for
seven
nights
.
My
mother
told
me
I
must
have
slept
,
it
was
impossible
not
to
sleep
in
all
that
time
,
but
if
I
slept
,
it
was
with
my
eyes
wide
open
,
for
I
had
followed
the
green
,
luminous
course
of
the
second
hand
and
the
minute
hand
and
the
hour
hand
of
the
bedside
clock
through
their
circles
and
semi-circles
,
every
night
for
seven
nights
,
without
missing
a
second
,
or
a
minute
,
or
an
hour
.
The
reason
I
had
n't
washed
my
clothes
or
my
hair
was
because
it
seemed
so
silly
.
I
saw
the
days
of
the
year
stretching
ahead
like
a
series
of
bright
,
white
boxes
,
and
separating
one
box
from
another
was
sleep
,
like
a
black
shade
.
Only
for
me
,
the
long
perspective
of
shades
that
set
off
one
box
from
the
next
had
suddenly
snapped
up
,
and
I
could
see
day
after
day
after
day
glaring
ahead
of
me
like
a
white
,
broad
,
infinitely
desolate
avenue
.
It
seemed
silly
to
wash
one
day
when
I
would
only
have
to
wash
again
the
next
.
It
made
me
tired
just
to
think
of
it
.
I
wanted
to
do
everything
once
and
for
all
and
be
through
with
it
.
Doctor
Gordon
twiddled
a
silver
pencil
``
Your
mother
tells
me
you
are
upset
.
''
I
curled
in
the
cavernous
leather
chair
and
faced
Doctor
Gordon
across
an
acre
of
highly
polished
desk
.
Doctor
Gordon
waited
.
He
tapped
his
pencil
--
tap
,
tap
,
tap
--
across
the
neat
green
field
of
his
blotter
.
His
eyelashes
were
so
long
and
thick
they
looked
artificial
.
Black
plastic
reeds
fringing
two
green
,
glacial
pools
.
Doctor
Gordon
's
features
were
so
perfect
he
was
almost
pretty
.
I
hated
him
the
minute
I
walked
in
through
the
door
.
I
had
imagined
a
kind
,
ugly
,
intuitive
man
looking
up
and
saying
``
Ah
!
''
in
an
encoraging
way
,
as
if
he
could
see
something
I
could
n't
,
and
then
I
would
find
words
to
tell
him
how
I
was
so
scared
,
as
if
I
were
being
stuffed
farther
and
farther
into
a
black
,
airless
sack
with
no
way
out
.
Then
he
would
lean
back
in
his
chair
and
match
the
tips
of
his
fingers
together
in
a
little
steeple
and
tell
me
why
I
could
n't
sleep
and
why
I
could
n't
read
and
why
I
could
n't
eat
and
why
everything
people
did
seemed
so
silly
,
because
they
only
died
in
the
end
.
And
then
,
I
thought
,
he
would
help
me
,
step
by
step
,
to
be
myself
again
.
But
Doctor
Gordon
was
n't
like
that
at
all
.
He
was
young
and
good-looking
,
and
I
could
see
right
away
he
was
conceited
.
Doctor
Gordon
had
a
photograph
on
his
desk
,
in
a
silver
frame
,
that
half
faced
him
and
half
faced
my
leather
chair
.
It
was
a
family
photograph
,
and
it
showed
a
beautiful
dark-haired
woman
,
who
could
have
been
Doctor
Gordon
's
sister
,
smiling
out
over
the
heads
of
two
blond
children
.
I
think
one
child
was
a
boy
and
one
was
a
girl
,
but
it
may
have
been
that
both
children
were
boys
or
that
both
were
girls
,
it
is
hard
to
tell
when
children
are
so
small
.
I
think
there
was
also
a
dog
in
the
picture
,
toward
the
bottom
--
a
kind
of
airedale
or
a
golden
retriever
--
but
it
may
have
only
been
the
pattern
in
the
woman
's
skirt
.
For
some
reason
the
photograph
made
me
furious
.
I
did
n't
see
why
it
should
be
turned
half
toward
me
unless
Doctor
Gordon
was
trying
to
show
me
right
away
that
he
was
married
to
some
glamorous
woman
and
I
'd
better
not
get
any
funny
ideas
.
Then
I
thought
,
how
could
this
Doctor
Gordon
help
me
anyway
,
with
a
beautiful
wife
and
beautiful
children
and
a
beautiful
dog
haloing
him
like
the
angels
on
a
Christmas
card
?
``
Suppose
you
try
and
tell
me
what
you
think
is
wrong
.
''
I
turned
the
words
over
suspiciously
,
like
round
,
sea-polished
pebbles
that
might
suddenly
put
out
a
claw
and
change
into
something
else
.
What
did
I
think
was
wrong
?
That
made
it
sound
as
if
nothing
was
really
wrong
,
I
only
thought
it
was
wrong
.
In
a
dull
,
flat
voice
--
to
show
I
was
not
beguiled
by
his
good
looks
or
his
family
photograph
--
I
told
Doctor
Gordon
about
not
sleeping
and
not
eating
and
not
reading
.
I
did
n't
tell
him
about
the
handwriting
,
which
bothered
me
most
of
all
.
That
morning
I
had
tried
to
write
a
letter
to
Doreen
,
down
in
West
Virginia
,
asking
whether
I
could
come
and
live
with
her
and
maybe
get
a
job
at
her
college
waiting
on
table
or
something
.
But
when
I
took
up
my
pen
,
my
hand
made
big
,
jerky
letters
like
those
of
a
child
,
and
the
lines
sloped
down
the
page
from
left
to
right
almost
diagonally
,
as
if
they
were
loops
of
string
lying
on
the
paper
,
and
someone
had
come
along
and
blown
them
askew
.
I
knew
I
could
n't
send
a
letter
like
that
,
so
I
tore
it
up
in
little
pieces
and
put
them
in
my
pocketbook
,
next
to
my
all-purpose
compact
,
in
case
the
psychiatrist
asked
to
see
them
.
But
of
course
Doctor
Gordon
did
n't
ask
to
see
them
,
as
I
had
n't
mentioned
them
,
and
I
began
to
feel
pleased
at
my
cleverness
.
I
thought
I
only
need
tell
him
what
I
wanted
to
,
and
that
I
could
control
the
picture
he
had
of
me
by
hiding
this
and
revealing
that
,
all
the
while
he
thought
he
was
so
smart
.
The
whole
time
I
was
talking
,
Doctor
Gordon
bent
his
head
as
if
he
were
praying
,
and
the
only
noise
apart
from
the
dull
,
flat
voice
was
the
tap
,
tap
,
tap
of
Doctor
Gordon
's
pencil
at
the
same
point
on
the
green
blotter
,
like
a
stalled
walking
stick
.
When
I
had
finished
,
Doctor
Gordon
lifted
his
head
.
''Where
did
you
say
you
went
to
college
?
''
Baffled
,
I
told
him
.
I
did
n't
see
where
college
fitted
in
.
``
Ah
!
''
Doctor
Gordon
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
staring
into
the
air
over
my
shoulder
with
a
reminiscent
smile
.
I
thought
he
was
going
to
tell
me
his
diagnosis
,
and
that
perhaps
I
had
judged
him
too
hastily
and
too
unkindly
.
But
he
only
said
,
``
I
remember
your
college
well
.
I
was
up
there
,
during
the
war
.
They
had
a
WAC
station
,
did
n't
they
?
Or
was
it
WAVES
?
''
I
said
I
did
n't
know
.
``
Yes
,
a
WAC
station
,
I
remember
now
.
I
was
doctor
for
the
lot
,
before
I
was
sent
overseas
.
My
,
they
were
a
pretty
bunch
of
girls
.
''
Doctor
Gordon
laughed
.
Then
,
in
one
smooth
move
,
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
strolled
toward
me
round
the
corner
of
his
desk
.
I
was
n't
sure
what
he
meant
to
do
,
so
I
stood
up
as
well
.
Doctor
Gordon
reached
for
the
hand
that
hung
at
my
right
side
and
shook
it
.
``
See
you
next
week
,
then
.
''
The
full
,
bosomy
elms
made
a
tunnel
of
shade
over
the
yellow
and
red
brick
fronts
along
Commonwealth
Avenue
,
and
a
trolley
car
was
threading
itself
toward
Boston
down
its
slim
,
silver
track
.
I
waited
for
the
trolley
to
pass
,
then
crossed
to
the
gray
Chevrolet
at
the
opposite
curb
.
I
could
see
my
mother
's
face
,
anxious
and
sallow
as
a
slice
of
lemon
,
peering
up
at
me
through
the
windshield
.
``
Well
,
what
did
he
say
?
''
I
pulled
the
car
door
shut
.
It
did
n't
catch
.
I
pushed
it
out
and
drew
it
in
again
with
a
dull
slam
.
``
He
said
he
'll
see
me
next
week
.
''
My
mother
sighed
.
Doctor
Gordon
cost
twenty-five
dollars
an
hour
.
``
Hi
there
,
what
's
your
name
?
''
``
Elly
Higginbottom
.
''
The
sailor
fell
into
step
beside
me
,
and
I
smiled
.
I
thought
there
must
be
as
many
sailors
on
the
Common
as
there
were
pigeons
.
They
seemed
to
come
out
of
a
dun-colored
recruiting
house
on
the
far
side
,
with
blue
and
white
``
Join
the
Navy
''
posters
stuck
up
on
billboards
round
it
and
all
over
the
inner
walls
.
``
Where
do
you
come
from
,
Elly
?
''
``
Chicago
.
''
I
had
never
been
to
Chicago
,
but
I
knew
one
or
two
boys
who
went
to
Chicago
University
,
and
it
seemed
the
sort
of
place
where
unconventional
,
mixed-up
people
would
come
from
.
``
You
sure
are
a
long
way
from
home
.
''
The
sailor
put
his
arm
around
my
waist
,
and
for
a
long
time
we
walked
around
the
Common
like
that
,
the
sailor
stroking
my
hip
through
the
green
dirndl
skirt
,
and
me
smiling
mysteriously
and
trying
not
to
say
anything
that
would
show
I
was
from
Boston
and
might
at
any
moment
meet
Mrs.
Willard
,
or
one
of
my
mother
's
other
friends
,
crossing
the
Common
after
tea
on
Beacon
Hill
or
shopping
in
Filene
's
Basement
.
I
thought
if
I
ever
did
get
to
Chicago
,
I
might
change
my
name
to
Elly
Higginbottom
for
good
.
Then
nobody
would
know
I
had
thrown
up
a
scholarship
at
a
big
eastern
women
's
college
and
mucked
up
a
month
in
New
York
and
refused
a
perfectly
solid
medical
student
for
a
husband
who
would
one
day
be
a
member
of
the
AMA
and
earn
pots
of
money
.
In
Chicago
,
people
would
take
me
for
what
I
was
.
I
would
be
simple
Elly
Higgenbottom
,
the
orphan
.
People
would
love
me
for
my
sweet
,
quiet
nature
.
They
would
n't
be
after
me
to
read
books
and
write
long
papers
on
the
twins
in
James
Joyce
.
And
one
day
I
might
just
marry
a
virile
,
but
tender
,
garage
mechanic
and
have
a
big
cowy
family
,
like
Dodo
Conway
.
If
I
happened
to
feel
like
it
.
``
What
do
you
want
to
do
when
you
get
out
of
the
Navy
?
''
I
asked
the
sailor
suddenly
.
It
was
the
longest
sentence
I
had
said
,
and
he
seemed
taken
aback
.
He
pushed
his
white
cupcake
cap
to
one
side
and
scratched
his
head
.
``
Well
,
I
dunno
,
Elly
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
might
just
go
to
college
on
the
G.I
.
Bill
''
I
paused
.
Then
I
said
suggestively
,
``
You
ever
thought
of
opening
a
garage
?
''
``
Nope
,
''
said
the
sailor
.
``
Never
have
.
''
I
peered
at
him
from
the
corner
of
my
eye
.
He
did
n't
look
a
day
over
sixteen
.
``
Do
you
know
how
old
I
am
?
''
I
said
accusingly
.
The
sailor
grinned
at
me
.
``
Nope
,
and
I
do
n't
care
either
.
''
It
occurred
to
me
that
this
sailor
was
really
remarkably
handsome
.
He
looked
Nordic
and
virginal
.
Now
I
was
simple-minded
it
seemed
I
attracted
clean
,
handsome
people
.
``
Well
,
I
'm
thirty
,
''
I
said
,
and
waited
.
``
Gee
,
Elly
,
you
do
n't
look
it
.
''
The
sailor
squeezed
my
hip
.
Then
he
glanced
quickly
from
left
to
right
.
``
Listen
,
Elly
,
if
we
go
round
to
those
steps
over
there
,
under
the
monument
,
I
can
kiss
you
.
''
At
that
moment
I
noticed
a
brown
figure
in
sensible
flat
brown
shoes
striding
across
the
Common
in
my
direction
.
From
the
distance
,
I
could
n't
make
out
any
features
on
the
dime-sized
face
,
but
I
knew
it
was
Mrs.
Willard
.
``
Could
you
please
tell
me
the
way
to
the
subway
?
''
I
said
to
the
sailor
in
a
loud
voice
.
``
Huh
?
''
``
The
subway
that
goes
out
to
the
Deer
Island
Prison
?
''
When
Mrs.
Willard
came
up
I
would
have
to
pretend
I
was
only
asking
the
sailor
directions
,
and
did
n't
really
know
him
at
all
.
``
Take
your
hands
off
me
,
''
I
said
between
my
teeth
.
``
Say
,
Elly
,
what
's
up
?
''
The
woman
approached
and
passed
by
without
a
look
or
a
nod
,
and
of
course
it
was
n't
Mrs.
Willard
.
Mrs.
Willard
was
at
her
cottage
in
the
Adirondacks
.
I
fixed
the
woman
's
receding
back
with
a
vengeful
stare
.
``
Say
,
Elly
.
.
.
''
``
I
thought
it
was
somebody
I
knew
,
''
I
said
.
``
Some
blasted
lady
from
this
orphan
home
in
Chicago
.
''
The
sailor
put
his
arm
around
me
again
.
``
You
mean
you
got
no
mom
and
dad
,
Elly
?
''
``
No
.
''
I
let
out
a
tear
that
seemed
ready
.
It
made
a
little
hot
track
down
my
cheek
.
``
Say
,
Elly
,
do
n't
cry
.
This
lady
,
was
she
mean
to
you
?
''
``
She
was
.
.
.
she
was
awful
.
''
The
tears
came
in
a
rush
,
then
,
and
while
the
sailor
was
holding
me
and
patting
them
dry
with
a
big
,
clean
,
white
linen
handkerchief
in
the
shelter
of
an
American
elm
,
I
thought
what
an
awful
woman
that
lady
in
the
brown
suit
had
been
,
and
how
she
,
whether
she
knew
it
or
not
,
was
responsible
for
my
taking
the
wrong
turn
here
and
the
wrong
path
there
and
for
everything
bad
that
happened
after
that
.
``
Well
,
Esther
,
how
do
you
feel
this
week
?
''
Doctor
Gordon
cradled
his
pencil
like
a
slim
,
silver
bullet
.
``
The
same
.
''
``
The
same
?
''
He
quirked
an
eyebrow
,
as
if
he
did
n't
believe
it
.
So
I
told
him
again
,
in
the
same
dull
,
flat
voice
,
only
it
was
angrier
this
time
,
because
he
seemed
so
slow
to
understand
,
how
I
had
n't
slept
for
fourteen
nights
and
how
I
could
n't
read
or
write
or
swallow
very
well
.
Doctor
Gordon
seemed
unimpressed
.
I
dug
into
my
pocketbook
and
found
the
scraps
of
my
letter
to
Doreen
.
I
took
them
out
and
let
them
flutter
on
to
Doctor
Gordon
's
immaculate
green
blotter
.
They
lay
there
,
dumb
as
daisy
petals
in
a
summer
meadow
.
``
What
,
''
I
said
,
``
do
you
think
of
that
?
''
I
thought
Doctor
Gordon
must
immediately
see
how
bad
the
handwriting
was
,
but
he
only
said
,
``
I
think
I
would
like
to
speak
to
your
mother
.
Do
you
mind
?
''
``
No
.
''
But
I
did
n't
like
the
idea
of
Doctor
Gordon
talking
to
my
mother
one
bit
.
I
thought
he
might
tell
her
I
should
be
locked
up
.
I
picked
up
every
scrap
of
my
letter
to
Doreen
,
so
Doctor
Gordon
could
n't
piece
them
together
and
see
I
was
planning
to
run
away
,
and
walked
out
of
his
office
without
another
word
.
I
watched
my
mother
grow
smaller
and
smaller
until
she
disappeared
into
the
door
of
Doctor
Gordon
's
office
building
.
Then
I
watched
her
grow
larger
and
larger
as
she
came
back
to
the
car
.
``
Well
?
''
I
could
tell
she
had
been
crying
.
My
mother
did
n't
look
at
me
.
She
started
the
car
.
Then
she
said
,
as
we
glided
under
the
cool
,
deep-sea
shade
of
the
elms
,
``
Doctor
Gordon
does
n't
think
you
've
improved
at
all
.
He
thinks
you
should
have
some
shock
treatments
at
his
private
hospital
in
Walton
.
''
I
felt
a
sharp
stab
of
curiosity
,
as
if
I
had
just
read
a
terrible
newspaper
headline
about
somebody
else
.
``
Does
he
mean
live
there
?
''
``
No
,
''
my
mother
said
,
and
her
chin
quivered
.
I
thought
she
must
be
lying
.
``
You
tell
me
the
truth
,
''
I
said
,
``
or
I
'll
never
speak
to
you
again
.
''
``
Do
n't
I
always
tell
you
the
truth
?
''
my
mother
said
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
SUICIDE
SAVED
FROM
7-STORY
LEDGE
!
After
two
hours
on
a
narrow
ledge
seven
stories
above
a
concrete
parking
lot
and
gathered
crowds
,
Mr.
George
Pollucci
let
himself
be
helped
to
safety
through
a
nearby
window
by
Sgt
.
Will
Kilmartin
of
the
Charles
Street
police
force
.
I
cracked
open
a
peanut
from
the
ten-cent
bag
I
had
bought
to
feed
the
pigeons
,
and
ate
it
.
It
tasted
dead
,
like
a
bit
of
old
tree
bark
.
I
brought
the
newspaper
close
up
to
my
eyes
to
get
a
better
view
of
George
Pollucci
's
face
,
spotlighted
lie
a
three-quarter
moon
against
a
vague
background
of
brick
and
black
sky
.
I
felt
he
had
something
important
to
tell
me
,
and
whatever
it
was
might
just
be
written
on
his
face
.
But
the
smudgy
crags
of
George
Pollucci
's
features
melted
away
as
I
peered
at
them
,
and
resolved
themselves
into
a
regular
pattern
of
dark
and
light
and
medium-gray
dots
.
The
inky-black
newspaper
paragraph
did
n't
tell
why
Mr.
Pollucci
was
on
the
ledge
,
or
what
Sgt
.
Kilmartin
did
to
him
when
he
finally
got
him
in
through
the
window
.
The
trouble
about
jumping
was
that
if
you
did
n't
pick
the
right
number
of
stories
,
you
might
still
be
alive
when
you
hit
bottom
.
I
thought
seven
stories
must
be
a
safe
distance
.
I
folded
the
paper
and
wedged
it
between
the
slats
of
the
park
bench
.
It
was
what
my
mother
called
a
scandal
sheet
,
full
of
the
local
murders
and
suicides
and
beatings
and
robbings
,
and
just
about
every
page
had
a
half-naked
lady
on
it
with
her
breasts
surging
over
the
edge
of
her
dress
and
her
legs
arranged
so
you
could
see
to
her
stocking
tops
.
I
did
n't
know
why
I
had
never
bought
any
of
these
papers
before
.
They
were
the
only
things
I
could
read
.
The
little
paragraphs
between
the
pictures
ended
before
the
letters
had
a
chance
to
get
cocky
and
wiggle
about
.
At
home
,
all
I
ever
saw
was
the
Christian
Science
Monitor
,
which
appeared
on
the
doorstep
at
five
o'clock
every
day
but
Sunday
and
treated
suicides
and
sex
crimes
and
airplane
crashes
as
if
they
did
n't
happen
.
A
big
white
swan
full
of
little
children
approached
my
bench
,
then
turned
around
a
bosky
islet
covered
with
ducks
and
paddled
back
under
the
dark
arch
of
the
bridge
.
Everything
I
looked
at
seemed
bright
and
extremely
tiny
.
I
saw
,
as
if
through
the
keyhole
of
a
door
I
could
n't
open
,
myself
and
my
younger
brother
,
knee-high
and
holding
rabbit-eared
balloons
,
climb
aboard
a
swanboat
and
fight
for
a
seat
at
the
edge
,
over
the
peanut-shell-paved
water
.
My
mouth
tasted
of
cleanness
and
peppermint
.
If
we
were
good
at
the
dentist
's
,
my
mother
always
bought
us
a
swanboat
ride
.
I
circled
the
Public
Garden
--
over
the
bridge
and
under
the
blue-green
monuments
,
past
the
American
flag
flowerbed
and
the
entrance
where
you
could
have
your
picture
taken
in
an
orange-and-white
striped
canvas
booth
for
twenty-five
cents
--
reading
the
names
of
the
trees
.
My
favorite
tree
was
the
Weeping
Scholar
Tree
.
I
thought
it
must
come
from
Japan
.
They
understood
things
of
the
spirit
in
Japan
.
They
disemboweled
themselves
when
anything
went
wrong
.
I
tried
to
imagine
how
they
would
go
about
it
.
They
must
have
an
extremely
sharp
knife
.
No
,
probably
two
extremely
sharp
knives
.
Then
they
would
sit
down
,
cross-legged
,
a
knife
in
either
hand
.
Then
they
would
cross
their
hands
and
point
a
knife
at
each
side
of
their
stomach
.
They
would
have
to
be
naked
,
or
the
knife
would
get
stuck
in
their
clothes
.
Then
in
one
quick
flash
,
before
they
had
time
to
think
twice
,
they
would
jab
the
knives
in
and
zip
them
round
,
one
on
the
upper
crescent
and
one
on
the
lower
crescent
,
making
a
full
circle
.
Then
their
stomach
skin
would
come
loose
,
like
a
plate
,
and
their
insides
would
fall
out
,
and
they
would
die
.
It
must
take
a
lot
of
courage
to
die
like
that
.
My
trouble
was
I
hated
the
sight
of
blood
.
I
thought
I
might
stay
in
the
park
all
night
.
The
next
morning
Dodo
Conway
was
driving
my
mother
and
me
to
Walton
,
and
if
I
was
to
run
away
before
it
was
too
late
,
now
was
the
time
.
I
looked
in
my
pocketbook
and
counted
out
a
dollar
bill
and
seventy-nine
cents
in
dunes
and
nickels
and
pennies
.
I
had
no
idea
how
much
it
would
cost
to
get
to
Chicago
,
and
I
did
n't
dare
go
to
the
bank
and
draw
out
all
my
money
,
because
I
thought
Doctor
Gordon
might
well
have
warned
the
bank
clerk
to
intercept
me
if
I
made
an
obvious
move
.
Hitchhiking
occurred
to
me
,
but
I
had
no
idea
which
of
all
the
routes
out
of
Boston
led
to
Chicago
.
It
's
easy
enough
to
find
directions
on
a
map
,
but
I
had
very
little
knowledge
of
directions
when
I
was
smack
in
the
middle
of
somewhere
.
Every
time
I
wanted
to
figure
what
was
east
or
what
was
west
it
seemed
to
be
noon
,
or
cloudy
,
which
was
no
help
at
all
,
or
nighttime
,
and
except
for
the
Big
Dipper
and
Cassiopeia
's
Chair
,
I
was
hopeless
at
stars
,
a
failing
which
always
disheartened
Buddy
Willard
.
I
decided
to
walk
to
the
bus
terminal
and
inquire
about
the
fares
to
Chicago
.
Then
I
might
go
to
the
bank
and
withdraw
precisely
that
amount
,
which
would
not
cause
so
much
suspicion
.
I
had
just
strolled
in
through
the
glass
doors
of
the
terminal
and
was
browsing
over
the
rack
of
colored
tour
leaflets
and
schedules
,
when
I
realized
that
the
bank
in
my
home
town
would
be
closed
,
as
it
was
already
mid-afternoon
,
and
I
could
n't
get
any
money
out
till
the
next
day
.
My
appointment
at
Walton
was
for
ten
o'clock
.
At
that
moment
,
the
loudspeaker
crackled
into
life
and
started
announcing
the
stops
of
a
bus
getting
ready
to
leave
in
the
parking
lot
outside
.
The
voice
on
the
loudspeaker
went
bockle
bockle
bockle
,
the
way
they
do
,
so
you
ca
n't
understand
a
word
,
and
then
,
in
the
middle
of
all
the
static
,
I
heard
a
familiar
name
clear
as
A
on
the
piano
in
the
middle
of
all
the
tuning
instruments
of
an
orchestra
.
It
was
a
stop
two
blocks
from
my
house
.
I
hurried
out
into
the
hot
,
dusty
,
end-of-July
afternoon
,
sweating
and
sandy-
mouthed
,
as
if
late
for
a
difficult
interview
,
and
boarded
the
red
bus
,
whose
motor
was
already
running
.
I
handed
my
fare
to
the
driver
,
and
silently
,
on
gloved
hinges
,
the
door
folded
shut
at
my
back
Twelve
DOCTOR
GORDON
'S
private
hospital
crowned
a
grassy
rise
at
the
end
of
a
long
,
secluded
drive
that
had
been
whitened
with
broken
quahog
shells
.
The
yellow
clapboard
walls
of
the
large
house
,
with
its
encircling
veranda
,
gleamed
in
the
sun
,
but
no
people
strolled
on
the
green
dome
of
the
lawn
.
As
my
mother
and
I
approached
the
summer
heat
bore
down
on
us
,
and
a
cicada
started
up
,
like
an
aerial
lawnmower
,
in
the
heart
of
a
copper
beech
tree
at
the
back
.
The
sound
of
the
cicada
only
served
to
underline
the
enormous
silence
.
A
nurse
met
us
at
the
door
.
``
Will
you
wait
in
the
living
room
,
please
.
Doctor
Gordon
will
be
with
you
presently
.
''
What
bothered
me
was
that
everything
about
the
house
seemed
normal
,
although
I
knew
it
must
be
chock-full
of
crazy
people
.
There
were
no
bars
on
the
windows
that
I
could
see
,
and
no
wild
or
disquieting
noises
.
Sunlight
measured
itself
out
in
regular
oblongs
on
the
shabby
,
but
soft
red
carpets
,
and
a
whiff
of
fresh-cut
grass
sweetened
the
air
.
I
paused
in
the
doorway
of
the
living
room
.
For
a
minute
I
thought
it
was
the
replica
of
a
lounge
in
a
guest
house
I
visited
once
on
an
island
off
the
coast
of
Maine
.
The
French
doors
let
in
a
dazzle
of
white
light
,
a
grand
piano
filled
the
far
corner
of
the
room
,
and
people
in
summer
clothes
were
sitting
about
at
card
tables
and
in
the
lopsided
wicker
armchairs
one
so
often
finds
at
down-at-
heel
seaside
resorts
.
Then
I
realized
that
none
of
the
people
were
moving
.
I
focused
more
closely
,
trying
to
pry
some
clue
from
their
stiff
postures
.
I
made
out
men
and
women
,
and
boys
and
girls
who
must
be
as
young
as
I
,
but
there
was
a
uniformity
to
their
faces
,
as
if
they
had
lain
for
a
long
time
on
the
shelf
,
out
of
the
sunlight
,
under
siftings
of
pale
,
fine
dust
.
Then
I
saw
that
some
of
the
people
were
indeed
moving
,
but
with
such
small
,
birdlike
gestures
I
had
not
at
first
discerned
them
.
A
gray-faced
man
was
counting
out
a
deck
of
cards
,
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
.
.
.
I
thought
he
must
be
seeing
if
it
was
a
full
pack
,
but
when
he
had
finished
counting
,
he
started
over
again
.
Next
to
him
,
a
fat
lady
played
with
a
string
of
wooden
beads
.
She
drew
all
the
beads
up
to
one
end
of
the
string
.
Then
click
,
click
,
click
,
she
let
them
fall
back
on
each
other
.
At
the
piano
,
a
young
girl
leafed
through
a
few
sheets
of
music
,
but
when
she
saw
me
looking
at
her
,
she
ducked
her
head
crossly
and
tore
the
sheets
in
half
.
My
mother
touched
my
arm
,
and
I
followed
her
into
the
room
.
We
sat
,
without
speaking
,
on
a
lumpy
sofa
that
creaked
each
time
one
stirred
.
Then
my
gaze
slid
over
the
people
to
the
blaze
of
green
beyond
the
diaphanous
curtains
,
and
I
felt
as
if
I
were
sitting
in
the
window
of
an
enormous
department
store
.
The
figures
around
me
were
n't
people
,
but
shop
dummies
,
painted
to
resemble
people
and
propped
up
in
attitudes
counterfeiting
life
.
I
climbed
after
Doctor
Gordon
's
dark-jacketed
back
.
Downstairs
,
in
the
hall
,
I
had
tried
to
ask
him
what
the
shock
treatment
would
be
like
,
but
when
I
opened
my
mouth
no
words
came
out
,
my
eyes
only
widened
and
stared
at
the
smiling
,
familiar
face
that
floated
before
me
like
a
plate
full
of
assurances
.
At
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
the
garnet-colored
carpet
stopped
.
A
plain
,
brown
linoleum
,
tacked
to
the
floor
,
took
its
place
,
and
extended
down
a
corridor
lined
with
shut
white
doors
.
As
I
followed
Doctor
Gordon
,
a
door
opened
somewhere
in
the
distance
,
and
I
heard
a
woman
shouting
.
All
at
once
a
nurse
popped
around
the
corner
of
the
corridor
ahead
of
us
leading
a
woman
in
a
blue
bathrobe
with
shaggy
,
waist-length
hair
.
Doctor
Gordon
stepped
back
,
and
I
flattened
against
the
wall
As
the
woman
was
dragged
by
,
waving
her
arms
and
struggling
in
the
grip
of
the
nurse
,
she
was
saying
,
``
I
'm
going
to
jump
out
of
the
window
,
I
'm
going
to
jump
out
of
the
window
,
I
'm
going
to
jump
out
of
the
window
.
''
Dumpy
and
muscular
in
her
smudge-fronted
uniform
,
the
wall-eyed
nurse
wore
such
thick
spectacles
that
four
eyes
peered
out
at
me
from
behind
the
round
,
twin
panes
of
glass
.
I
was
trying
to
tell
which
eyes
were
the
real
eyes
and
which
the
false
eyes
,
and
which
of
the
real
eyes
was
the
wall-eye
and
which
the
straight
eye
,
when
she
brought
her
face
up
to
mine
with
a
large
,
conspiratorial
grin
and
hissed
,
as
if
to
reassure
me
,
``
She
thinks
she
's
going
to
jump
out
the
window
but
she
ca
n't
jump
out
the
window
because
they
're
all
barred
!
''
And
as
Doctor
Gordon
led
me
into
a
bare
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
I
saw
that
the
windows
in
that
part
were
indeed
barred
,
and
that
the
room
door
and
the
closet
door
and
the
drawers
of
the
bureau
and
everything
that
opened
and
shut
was
fitted
with
a
keyhole
so
it
could
be
locked
up
.
I
lay
down
on
the
bed
.
The
wall-eyed
nurse
came
back
.
She
unclasped
my
watch
and
dropped
it
in
her
pocket
.
Then
she
started
tweaking
the
hairpins
from
my
hair
.
Doctor
Gordon
was
unlocking
the
closet
.
He
dragged
out
a
table
on
wheels
with
a
machine
on
it
and
rolled
it
behind
the
head
of
the
bed
.
The
nurse
started
swabbing
my
temples
with
a
smelly
grease
.
As
she
leaned
over
to
reach
the
side
of
my
head
nearest
the
wall
,
her
fat
breast
muffled
my
face
like
a
cloud
or
a
pillow
.
A
vague
,
medicinal
stench
emanated
from
her
flesh
.
``
Do
n't
worry
,
''
the
nurse
grinned
down
at
me
.
``
Their
first
time
everybody
's
scared
to
death
.
''
I
tried
to
smile
,
but
my
skin
had
gone
stiff
,
like
parchment
.
Doctor
Gordon
was
fitting
two
metal
plates
on
either
side
of
my
head
.
He
buckled
them
into
place
with
a
strap
that
dented
my
forehead
,
and
gave
me
a
wire
to
bite
.
I
shut
my
eyes
.
There
was
a
brief
silence
,
like
an
indrawn
breath
.
Then
something
bent
down
and
took
hold
of
me
and
shook
me
like
the
end
of
the
world
.
Whee-ee-ee-ee-ee
,
it
shrilled
,
through
an
air
crackling
with
blue
light
,
and
with
each
flash
a
great
jolt
drubbed
me
till
I
thought
my
bones
would
break
and
the
sap
fly
out
of
me
like
a
split
plant
.
I
wondered
what
terrible
thing
it
was
that
I
had
done
.
I
was
sitting
in
a
wicker
chair
,
holding
a
small
cocktail
glass
of
tomato
juice
.
The
watch
had
been
replaced
on
my
wrist
,
but
it
looked
odd
.
Then
I
realised
it
had
been
fastened
upside
down
.
I
sensed
the
unfamiliar
positioning
of
the
hairpins
in
my
hair
.
``
How
do
you
feel
?
''
An
old
metal
floor
lamp
surfaced
in
my
mind
.
One
of
the
few
relics
of
my
father
's
study
,
it
was
surmounted
by
a
copper
bell
which
held
the
light
bulb
,
and
from
which
a
frayed
,
tiger-colored
cord
ran
down
the
length
of
the
metal
stand
to
a
socket
in
the
wall
.
One
day
I
decided
to
move
this
lamp
from
the
side
of
my
mother
's
bed
to
my
desk
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
The
cord
would
be
long
enough
,
so
I
did
n't
unplug
it
.
I
closed
both
hands
around
the
lamp
and
the
fuzzy
cord
and
gripped
them
tight
Then
something
leapt
out
of
the
lamp
in
a
blue
flash
and
shook
me
till
my
teeth
rattled
,
and
I
tried
to
pull
my
hands
off
,
but
they
were
stuck
,
and
I
screamed
,
or
a
scream
was
torn
from
my
throat
,
for
I
did
n't
recognize
it
,
but
heard
it
soar
and
quaver
in
the
air
like
a
violently
disembodied
spirit
.
Then
my
hands
jerked
free
,
and
I
fell
back
onto
my
mother
's
bed
.
A
small
hole
,
blackened
as
if
with
pencil
lead
,
pitted
the
center
of
my
right
palm
.
``
How
do
you
feel
?
''
``
All
right
.
''
But
I
did
n't
.
I
felt
terrible
.
``
Which
college
did
you
say
you
went
to
?
''
I
said
what
college
it
was
.
``
Ah
!
''
Doctor
Gordon
's
face
lighted
with
a
slow
,
almost
tropical
smile
.
``
They
had
a
WAC
station
up
there
,
did
n't
they
,
during
the
war
?
''
My
mother
's
knuckles
were
bone-white
,
as
if
the
skin
had
worn
off
them
in
the
hour
of
waiting
.
She
looked
past
me
to
Doctor
Gordon
,
and
he
must
have
nodded
,
or
smiled
,
because
her
face
relaxed
.
``
A
few
more
shock
treatments
,
Mrs.
Greenwood
,
''
I
heard
Doctor
Gordon
say
,
``
and
I
think
you
'll
notice
a
wonderful
improvement
.
''
The
girl
was
still
sitting
on
the
piano
stool
,
the
torn
sheet
of
music
splayed
at
her
feet
like
a
dead
bird
.
She
stared
at
me
,
and
I
stared
back
.
Her
eyes
narrowed
.
She
stuck
out
her
tongue
.
My
mother
was
following
Doctor
Gordon
to
the
door
.
I
lingered
behind
,
and
when
their
backs
were
turned
,
I
rounded
on
the
girl
and
thumbed
both
ears
at
her
.
She
pulled
her
tongue
in
,
and
her
face
went
stony
.
I
walked
out
into
the
sun
.
Pantherlike
in
a
dapple
of
tree
shadow
,
Dodo
Conway
's
black
station
wagon
lay
in
wait
.
The
station
wagon
had
been
ordered
originally
by
a
wealthy
society
lady
,
black
,
without
a
speck
of
chrome
,
and
with
black
leather
upholstery
,
but
when
it
came
,
it
depressed
her
.
It
was
the
dead
spit
of
a
hearse
,
she
said
,
and
everybody
else
thought
so
too
,
and
nobody
would
buy
it
,
so
the
Conways
drove
it
home
,
cut-price
,
and
saved
themselves
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
.
Sitting
in
the
front
seat
,
between
Dodo
and
my
mother
,
I
felt
dumb
and
subdued
.
Every
time
I
tried
to
concentrate
,
my
mind
glided
off
,
like
a
skater
,
into
a
large
empty
space
,
and
pirouetted
there
,
absently
.
``
I
'm
through
with
that
Doctor
Gordon
,
''
I
said
,
after
we
had
left
Dodo
and
her
black
station
wagon
behind
the
pines
.
``
You
can
call
him
up
and
tell
him
I
'm
not
coming
next
week
.
''
My
mother
smiled
.
``
I
knew
my
baby
was
n't
like
that
.
''
I
looked
at
her
.
``
Like
what
?
''
``
Like
those
awful
people
.
Those
awful
dead
people
at
that
hospital
.
''
She
paused
.
``
I
knew
you
'd
decide
to
be
all
right
again
.
''
STARLET
SUCCUMBS
AFTER
68-HOUR
COMA
.
I
felt
in
my
pocketbook
among
the
paper
scraps
and
the
compact
and
the
peanut
shells
and
the
dimes
and
nickels
and
the
blue
jiffy
box
containing
nineteen
Gillette
blades
,
till
I
unearthed
the
snapshot
I
'd
had
taken
that
afternoon
in
the
orange-and-white
striped
booth
.
I
brought
it
up
next
to
the
smudgy
photograph
of
the
dead
girl
.
It
matched
,
mouth
for
mouth
,
nose
for
nose
.
The
only
difference
was
the
eyes
.
The
eyes
in
the
snapshot
were
open
,
and
those
in
the
newspaper
photograph
were
closed
.
But
I
knew
if
the
dead
girl
's
eyes
were
to
be
thumbed
wide
,
they
would
look
at
me
with
the
same
dead
,
black
,
vacant
expression
as
the
eyes
in
the
snapshot
.
I
stuffed
the
snapshot
back
in
my
pocketbook
.
``
I
will
just
sit
here
in
the
sun
on
this
park
bench
five
minutes
more
by
the
clock
on
that
building
over
there
,
''
I
told
myself
,
``
and
then
I
will
go
somewhere
and
do
it
.
''
I
summoned
my
little
chorus
of
voices
.
Does
n't
your
work
interest
you
,
Esther
?
You
know
,
Esther
,
you
've
got
the
perfect
setup
of
a
true
neurotic
.
You
'll
never
get
anywhere
like
that
,
you
'll
never
get
anywhere
like
that
,
you
'll
never
get
anywhere
like
that
.
Once
on
a
hot
summer
night
,
I
had
spent
an
hour
kissing
a
hairy
,
ape-shaped
law
student
from
Yale
because
I
felt
sorry
for
him
,
he
was
so
ugly
.
When
I
had
finished
,
he
said
,
``
I
have
you
typed
,
baby
.
You
'll
be
a
prude
at
forty
.
''
``
Factitious
!
''
my
creative
writing
professor
at
college
scrawled
on
a
story
of
mine
called
``
The
Big
Weekend
.
''
I
had
n't
known
what
factitious
meant
,
so
I
looked
it
up
in
the
dictionary
.
Factitious
,
artificial
,
sham
.
You
'll
never
get
anywhere
like
that
.
I
had
n't
slept
for
twenty-one
nights
.
I
thought
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
must
be
shadow
,
the
million
moving
shapes
and
cul-de-sacs
of
shadow
.
There
was
shadow
in
bureau
drawers
and
closets
and
suitcases
,
and
shadow
under
houses
and
trees
and
stones
,
and
shadow
at
the
back
of
people
's
eyes
and
smiles
,
and
shadow
,
miles
and
miles
and
miles
of
it
,
on
the
night
side
of
the
earth
.
I
looked
down
at
the
two
flesh-colored
Band-Aids
forming
a
cross
on
the
calf
of
my
right
leg
.
That
morning
I
had
made
a
start
.
I
had
locked
myself
in
the
bathroom
,
and
run
a
tub
full
of
warm
water
,
and
taken
out
a
Gillette
blade
.
When
they
asked
some
old
Roman
philosopher
or
other
how
he
wanted
to
die
,
he
said
he
would
open
his
veins
in
a
warm
bath
.
I
thought
it
would
be
easy
,
lying
in
the
tub
and
seeing
the
redness
flower
from
my
wrists
,
flush
after
flush
through
the
clear
water
,
till
I
sank
to
sleep
under
a
surf
gaudy
as
poppies
.
But
when
it
came
right
down
to
it
,
the
skin
of
my
wrist
looked
so
white
and
defenseless
that
I
could
n't
do
it
.
It
was
as
if
what
I
wanted
to
kill
was
n't
in
that
skin
or
the
thin
blue
pulse
that
jumped
under
my
thumb
,
but
somewhere
else
,
deeper
,
more
secret
,
a
whole
lot
harder
to
get
at
.
It
would
take
two
motions
.
One
wrist
,
then
the
other
wrist
.
Three
motions
,
if
you
counted
changing
the
razor
from
hand
to
hand
.
Then
I
would
step
into
the
tub
and
lie
down
.
I
moved
in
front
of
the
medicine
cabinet
.
If
I
looked
in
the
mirror
while
I
did
it
,
it
would
be
like
watching
somebody
else
,
in
a
book
or
a
play
.
But
the
person
in
the
mirror
was
paralyzed
and
too
stupid
to
do
a
thing
.
Then
I
thought
maybe
I
ought
to
spill
a
little
blood
for
practice
,
so
I
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
tub
and
crossed
my
right
ankle
over
my
left
knee
.
Then
I
lifted
my
right
hand
with
the
razor
and
let
it
drop
of
its
own
weight
,
like
a
guillotine
,
onto
the
calf
of
my
leg
.
I
felt
nothing
.
Then
I
felt
a
small
,
deep
thrill
,
and
a
bright
seam
of
red
welled
up
at
the
lip
of
the
slash
.
The
blood
gathered
darkly
,
like
fruit
,
and
rolled
down
my
ankle
into
the
cup
of
my
black
patent
leather
shoe
.
I
thought
of
getting
into
the
tub
then
,
but
I
realized
my
dallying
had
used
up
the
better
part
of
the
morning
,
and
that
my
mother
would
probably
come
home
and
find
me
before
I
was
done
.
So
I
bandaged
the
cut
,
packed
up
my
Gillette
blades
and
caught
the
eleven-thirty
bus
to
Boston
.
``
Sorry
,
baby
,
there
's
no
subway
to
the
Deer
Island
Prison
,
it
's
on
a
niland
.
''
``
No
,
it
's
not
on
an
island
,
it
used
to
be
on
an
island
,
but
they
filled
up
the
water
with
dirt
and
now
it
joins
on
to
the
mainland
.
''
``
There
's
no
subway
.
''
``
I
've
got
to
get
there
.
''
``
Hey
,
''
the
fat
man
in
the
ticket
booth
peered
at
me
through
the
grating
,
``
do
n't
cry
.
Who
you
got
there
,
honey
,
some
relative
?
''
People
shoved
and
bumped
by
me
in
the
artificially
lit
dark
,
hurrying
after
the
trains
that
rumbled
in
and
out
of
the
intestinal
tunnels
under
Scollay
Square
.
I
could
feel
the
tears
start
to
spurt
from
the
screwed-up
nozzles
of
my
eyes
.
``
It
's
my
father
.
''
The
fat
man
consulted
a
diagram
on
the
wall
of
his
booth
.
``
Here
's
how
you
do
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
take
a
car
from
that
track
over
there
and
get
off
at
Orient
Heights
and
then
hop
a
bus
with
The
Point
on
it
.
''
He
beamed
at
me
.
``
It
'll
run
you
straight
to
the
prison
gate
.
''
``
Hey
you
!
''
A
young
fellow
in
a
blue
uniform
waved
from
the
hut
.
I
waved
back
and
kept
on
going
.
``
Hey
you
!
''
I
stopped
and
walked
slowly
over
to
the
hut
that
perched
like
a
circular
living
room
on
the
waste
of
sands
.
``
Hey
,
you
ca
n't
go
any
further
.
That
's
prison
property
,
no
trespassers
allowed
.
''
``
I
thought
you
could
go
anyplace
along
the
beach
,
''
I
said
.
``
So
long
as
you
stayed
under
the
tideline
.
''
The
fellow
thought
a
minute
.
Then
he
said
,
``
Not
this
beach
.
''
He
had
a
pleasant
,
fresh
face
.
``
You
've
a
nice
place
here
,
''
I
said
.
``
It
's
like
a
little
house
.
''
He
glanced
back
into
the
room
,
with
its
braided
rug
and
chintz
curtains
.
He
smiled
.
``
We
even
got
a
coffee
pot
,
''
``
I
used
to
live
near
here
.
''
``
No
kidding
.
I
was
born
and
brought
up
in
this
town
myself
.
''
I
looked
across
the
sands
to
the
parking
lot
and
the
barred
gate
,
and
past
the
barred
gate
to
the
narrow
road
,
lapped
by
the
ocean
on
both
sides
,
that
led
out
to
the
one-
time
island
.
The
red
brick
buildings
of
the
prison
looked
friendly
,
like
the
buildings
of
a
seaside
college
.
On
a
green
hump
of
lawn
to
the
left
,
I
could
see
small
white
spots
and
slightly
larger
pink
spots
moving
about
.
I
asked
the
guard
what
they
were
,
and
he
said
,
``
Them
's
pigs
'n
'
chickens
.
''
I
was
thinking
that
if
I
'd
had
the
sense
to
go
on
living
in
that
old
town
I
might
just
have
met
this
prison
guard
in
school
and
married
him
and
had
a
parcel
of
little
kids
by
now
.
It
would
be
nice
,
living
by
the
sea
with
piles
of
little
kids
and
pigs
and
chickens
,
wearing
what
my
grandmother
called
wash
dresses
,
and
sitting
about
in
some
kitchen
with
bright
linoleum
and
fat
arms
,
drinking
pots
of
coffee
.
``
How
do
you
get
into
that
prison
?
''
``
You
get
a
pass
.
''
``
No
,
how
do
you
get
locked
in
?
''
``
Oh
,
''
the
guard
laughed
,
``
you
steal
a
car
,
you
rob
a
store
.
''
``
You
got
any
murderers
in
there
?
''
``
No
.
Murderers
go
to
a
big
state
place
.
''
``
Who
else
is
in
there
?
''
``
Well
,
the
first
day
of
winter
we
get
these
old
bums
out
of
Boston
.
They
heave
a
brick
through
a
window
,
and
then
they
get
picked
up
and
spend
the
winter
out
of
the
cold
,
with
TV
and
plenty
to
eat
,
and
basketball
games
on
the
weekend
.
''
``
That
's
nice
.
''
``
Nice
if
you
like
it
,
''
said
the
guard
.
I
said
good-bye
and
started
to
move
off
,
glancing
back
over
my
shoulder
only
once
.
The
guard
still
stood
in
the
doorway
of
his
observation
booth
,
and
when
I
turned
he
lifted
his
arm
in
a
salute
.
The
log
I
sat
on
was
lead-heavy
and
smelled
of
tar
.
Under
the
stout
,
gray
cylinder
of
the
water
tower
on
its
commanding
hill
,
the
sandbar
curved
out
into
the
sea
.
At
high
tide
the
bar
completely
submerged
itself
.
I
remembered
that
sandbar
well
.
It
harbored
,
in
the
crook
of
its
inner
curve
,
a
particular
shell
that
could
be
found
nowhere
else
on
the
beach
.
The
shell
was
thick
,
smooth
,
big
as
a
thumb
joint
,
and
usually
white
,
although
sometimes
pink
or
peach-colored
.
It
resembled
a
sort
of
modest
conch
.
``
Mummy
,
that
girl
's
still
sitting
there
.
''
I
looked
up
,
idly
,
and
saw
a
small
,
sandy
child
being
dragged
up
from
the
sea
's
edge
by
a
skinny
,
bird-eyed
woman
in
red
shorts
and
a
red-and-white
polka-dot
halter
.
I
had
n't
counted
on
the
beach
being
overrun
with
summer
people
.
In
the
ten
years
of
my
absence
,
fancy
blue
and
pink
and
pale
green
shanties
had
sprung
up
on
the
flat
sands
of
the
Point
like
a
crop
of
tasteless
mushrooms
,
and
the
silver
airplanes
and
cigar-
shaped
blimps
had
given
way
to
jets
that
scoured
the
rooftops
in
their
loud
offrush
from
the
airport
across
the
bay
.
I
was
the
only
girl
on
the
beach
in
a
skirt
and
high
heels
,
and
it
occurred
to
me
I
must
stand
out
.
I
had
removed
my
patent
leather
shoes
after
a
while
,
for
they
foundered
badly
in
the
sand
.
It
pleased
me
to
think
they
would
be
perched
there
on
the
silver
log
,
pointing
out
to
sea
,
like
a
sort
of
soul-compass
,
after
I
was
dead
.
I
fingered
the
box
of
razors
in
my
pocketbook
.
Then
I
thought
how
stupid
I
was
.
I
had
the
razors
,
but
no
warm
bath
.
I
considered
renting
a
room
.
There
must
be
a
boarding-house
among
all
those
summer
places
.
But
I
had
no
luggage
.
That
would
create
suspicion
.
Besides
,
in
a
boardinghouse
other
people
are
always
wanting
to
use
the
bathroom
.
I
'd
hardly
have
time
to
do
it
and
step
into
the
tub
when
somebody
would
be
pounding
at
the
door
.
The
gulls
on
their
wooden
stilts
at
the
tip
of
the
bar
miaowed
like
cats
.
Then
they
flapped
up
,
one
by
one
,
in
their
ash-colored
jackets
,
circling
my
head
and
crying
.
``
Say
,
lady
,
you
better
not
sit
out
here
,
the
tide
's
coming
in
.
''
The
small
boy
squatted
a
few
feet
away
.
He
picked
up
a
round
purple
stone
and
lobbed
it
into
the
water
.
The
water
swallowed
it
with
a
resonant
plop
.
Then
he
scrabbled
around
,
and
I
heard
the
dry
stones
clank
together
like
money
.
He
skimmed
a
flat
stone
over
the
dull
green
surface
,
and
it
skipped
seven
times
before
it
sliced
out
of
sight
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
go
home
?
''
I
said
.
The
boy
skipped
another
,
heavier
stone
.
It
sank
after
the
second
bounce
.
``
Do
n't
want
to
.
''
``
Your
mother
's
looking
for
you
.
''
``
She
is
not
.
''
He
sounded
worried
.
``
If
you
go
home
,
I
'll
give
you
some
candy
.
''
The
boy
hitched
closer
.
``
What
kind
?
''
But
I
knew
without
looking
into
my
pocketbook
that
all
I
had
was
peanut
shells
.
``
I
'll
give
you
some
money
to
buy
some
candy
.
''
``
Ar-thur
!
''
A
woman
was
indeed
coming
out
on
the
sandbar
,
slipping
and
no
doubt
cursing
to
herself
,
for
her
lips
went
up
and
down
between
her
clear
,
peremptory
calls
.
``
Ar-thur
!
''
She
shaded
her
eyes
with
one
hand
,
as
if
this
helped
her
discern
us
through
the
thickening
sea
dusk
.
I
could
sense
the
boy
's
interest
dwindle
as
the
pull
of
his
mother
increased
.
He
began
to
pretend
he
did
n't
know
me
.
He
kicked
over
a
few
stones
,
as
if
searching
for
something
,
and
edged
off
.
I
shivered
.
The
stones
lay
lumpish
and
cold
under
my
bare
feet
.
I
thought
longingly
of
the
black
shoes
on
the
beach
.
A
wave
drew
back
,
like
a
hand
,
then
advanced
and
touched
my
foot
.
The
drench
seemed
to
come
off
the
sea
floor
itself
,
where
blind
white
fish
ferried
themselves
by
their
own
light
through
the
great
polar
cold
.
I
saw
sharks
'
teeth
and
whales
'
earbones
littered
about
down
there
like
gravestones
.
I
waited
,
as
if
the
sea
could
make
my
decision
for
me
.
A
second
wave
collapsed
over
my
feet
,
lipped
with
white
froth
,
and
the
chill
gripped
my
ankles
with
a
mortal
ache
.
My
flesh
winced
,
in
cowardice
,
from
such
a
death
.
I
picked
up
my
pocketbook
and
started
back
over
the
cold
stones
to
where
my
shoes
kept
their
vigil
in
the
violet
light
.
Thirteen
``
Of
course
his
mother
killed
him
.
''
I
looked
at
the
mouth
of
the
boy
Jody
had
wanted
me
to
meet
.
His
lips
were
thick
and
pink
and
a
baby
face
nestled
under
the
silk
of
white-blond
hair
.
His
name
was
Cal
,
which
I
thought
must
be
short
for
something
,
but
I
could
n't
think
what
it
would
be
short
for
,
unless
it
was
California
.
``
How
can
you
be
sure
she
killed
him
?
''
I
said
.
Cal
was
supposed
to
be
very
intelligent
,
and
Jody
had
said
over
the
phone
that
he
was
cute
and
I
would
like
him
.
I
wondered
,
if
I
'd
been
my
old
self
,
if
I
would
have
liked
him
.
It
was
impossible
to
tell
.
``
Well
,
first
she
says
No
no
no
,
and
then
she
says
Yes
.
''
``
But
then
she
says
No
no
again
.
''
Cal
and
I
lay
side
by
side
on
an
orange-and-green
striped
towel
on
a
mucky
beach
across
the
swamps
from
Lynn
.
Jody
and
Mark
,
the
boy
she
was
pinned
to
,
were
swimming
.
Cal
had
n't
wanted
to
swim
,
he
had
wanted
to
talk
,
and
we
were
arguing
about
this
play
where
a
young
man
finds
out
he
has
a
brain
disease
,
on
account
of
his
father
fooling
around
with
unclean
women
,
and
in
the
end
his
brain
,
which
has
been
softening
all
along
,
snaps
completely
,
and
his
mother
is
debating
whether
to
kill
him
or
not
.
I
had
a
suspicion
that
my
mother
had
called
Jody
and
begged
her
to
ask
me
out
,
so
I
would
n't
sit
around
in
my
room
all
day
with
the
shades
drawn
.
I
did
n't
want
to
go
at
first
,
because
I
thought
Jody
would
notice
the
change
in
me
,
and
that
anybody
with
half
an
eye
would
see
I
did
n't
have
a
brain
in
my
head
.
But
all
during
the
drive
north
,
and
then
east
,
Jody
had
joked
and
laughed
and
chattered
and
not
seemed
to
mind
that
I
only
said
,
``
My
''
or
``
Gosh
''
or
``
You
do
n't
say
.
''
We
browned
hot
dogs
on
the
public
grills
at
the
beach
,
and
by
watching
Jody
and
Mark
and
Cal
very
carefully
I
managed
to
cook
my
hot
dog
just
the
right
amount
of
time
and
did
n't
burn
it
or
drop
it
into
the
fire
,
the
way
I
was
afraid
of
doing
.
Then
,
when
nobody
was
looking
,
I
buried
it
in
the
sand
.
After
we
ate
,
Jody
and
Mark
ran
down
to
the
water
hand-in-hand
,
and
I
lay
back
,
staring
into
the
sky
,
while
Cal
went
on
and
on
about
this
play
.
The
only
reason
I
remembered
this
play
was
because
it
had
a
mad
person
in
it
,
and
everything
I
had
ever
read
about
mad
people
stuck
in
my
mind
,
while
everything
else
flew
out
.
``
But
it
's
the
Yes
that
matters
,
''
Cal
said
.
``
It
's
the
Yes
she
'll
come
back
to
in
the
end
.
''
I
lifted
my
head
and
squinted
out
at
the
bright
blue
plate
of
the
sea
--
a
bright
blue
plate
with
a
dirty
rim
.
A
big
round
gray
rock
,
like
the
upper
half
of
an
egg
,
poked
out
of
the
water
about
a
mile
from
the
stony
headland
.
``
What
was
she
going
to
kill
him
with
?
I
forget
.
''
I
had
n't
forgotten
.
I
remembered
perfectly
well
,
but
I
wanted
to
hear
what
Cal
would
say
.
``
Morphia
powders
.
''
``
Do
you
suppose
they
have
morphia
powders
in
America
?
''
Cal
considered
a
minute
.
Then
he
said
,
``
I
would
n't
think
so
.
They
sound
awfully
old-fashioned
.
''
I
rolled
over
onto
my
stomach
and
squinted
at
the
view
in
the
other
direction
,
toward
Lynn
.
A
glassy
haze
rippled
up
from
the
fires
in
the
grills
and
the
heat
on
the
road
,
and
through
the
haze
,
as
through
a
curtain
of
clear
water
,
I
could
make
out
a
smudgy
skyline
of
gas
tanks
and
factory
stacks
and
derricks
and
bridges
.
It
looked
one
hell
of
a
mess
.
I
rolled
onto
my
back
again
and
made
my
voice
casual
.
``
If
you
were
going
to
kill
yourself
,
how
would
you
do
it
?
''
Cal
seemed
pleased
.
``
I
've
often
thought
of
that
.
I
'd
blow
my
brains
out
with
a
gun
.
''
I
was
disappointed
.
It
was
just
like
a
man
to
do
it
with
a
gun
.
A
fat
chance
I
had
of
laying
my
hands
on
a
gun
.
And
even
if
I
did
,
I
would
n't
have
a
clue
as
to
what
part
of
me
to
shoot
at
.
I
'd
already
read
in
the
papers
about
people
who
'd
tried
to
shoot
themselves
,
only
they
ended
up
shooting
an
important
nerve
and
getting
paralyzed
or
blasting
their
face
off
,
but
being
saved
,
by
surgeons
and
a
sort
of
miracle
,
from
dying
outright
.
The
risks
of
a
gun
seemed
great
.
``
What
kind
of
a
gun
?
''
``
My
father
's
shotgun
.
He
keeps
it
loaded
.
I
'd
just
have
to
walk
into
his
study
one
day
and
,
''
Cal
pointed
a
finger
to
his
temple
and
made
a
comical
,
screwed-up
face
,
``
click
!
''
He
widened
his
pale
gray
eyes
and
looked
at
me
.
``
Does
your
father
happen
to
live
near
Boston
?
''
I
asked
idly
.
``
Nope
,
in
Clacton-on-Sea
.
He
's
English
.
''
Jody
and
Mark
ran
up
hand-in-hand
,
dripping
and
shaking
off
water
drops
like
two
loving
puppies
.
I
thought
there
would
be
too
many
people
,
so
I
stood
up
and
pretended
to
yawn
.
``
I
guess
I
'll
go
for
a
swim
.
''
Being
with
Jody
and
Mark
and
Cal
was
beginning
to
weigh
on
my
nerves
,
like
a
dull
wooden
block
on
the
strings
of
a
piano
.
I
was
afraid
that
at
any
moment
my
control
would
snap
,
and
I
would
start
babbling
about
how
I
could
n't
read
and
could
n't
write
and
how
I
must
be
just
about
the
only
person
who
had
stayed
awake
for
a
solid
month
without
dropping
dead
of
exhaustion
,
A
smoke
seemed
to
be
going
up
from
my
nerves
like
the
smoke
from
the
grills
and
the
sun-saturated
road
.
The
whole
kndscape-beach
and
headland
and
sea
and
rock-
quavered
in
front
of
my
eyes
like
a
stage
backcloth
.
I
wondered
at
what
point
in
space
the
silly
,
sham
blue
of
the
sky
turned
black
.
``
You
swim
too
,
Cal
.
''
Jody
gave
Cal
a
playful
little
push
.
``
Ohhh
.
''
Cal
hid
his
face
in
the
towel
.
``
It
's
too
cold
.
''
I
started
to
walk
toward
the
water
.
Somehow
,
in
the
broad
,
shadowless
light
of
noon
,
the
water
looked
amiable
and
welcoming
.
I
thought
drowning
must
be
the
kindest
way
to
die
,
and
burning
the
worst
.
Some
of
those
babies
in
the
jars
that
Buddy
Willard
showed
me
had
gills
,
he
said
.
They
went
through
a
stage
where
they
were
just
like
fish
.
A
little
,
rubbishy
wavelet
,
full
of
candy
wrappers
and
orange
peel
and
seaweed
,
folded
over
my
foot
.
I
heard
the
sand
thud
behind
me
,
and
Cal
came
up
.
``
Let
's
swim
to
that
rock
out
there
.
''
I
pointed
at
it
``
Are
you
crazy
?
That
's
a
mile
out
.
''
``
What
are
you
?
''
I
said
.
``
Chicken
?
''
Cal
took
me
by
the
elbow
and
jostled
me
into
the
water
.
When
we
were
waist
high
,
he
pushed
me
under
.
I
surfaced
,
splashing
,
my
eyes
seared
with
salt
.
Underneath
,
the
water
was
green
and
semi-opaque
as
a
hunk
of
quartz
.
I
started
to
swim
,
a
modified
dogpaddle
,
keeping
my
face
toward
the
rock
.
Cal
did
a
slow
crawl
.
After
a
while
he
put
his
head
up
and
treaded
water
.
``
Ca
n't
make
it
.
''
He
was
panting
heavily
.
``
Okay
.
You
go
back
.
''
I
thought
I
would
swim
out
until
I
was
too
tired
to
swim
back
.
As
I
paddled
on
,
my
heartbeat
boomed
like
a
dull
motor
in
my
ears
.
I
am
I
am
I
am
.
That
morning
I
had
tried
to
hang
myself
.
I
had
taken
the
silk
cord
of
my
mother
's
yellow
bathrobe
as
soon
as
she
left
for
work
,
and
,
in
the
amber
shade
of
the
bedroom
,
fashioned
it
into
a
knot
that
slipped
up
and
down
on
itself
.
It
took
me
a
long
time
to
do
this
,
because
I
was
poor
at
knots
and
had
no
idea
how
to
make
a
proper
one
.
Then
I
hunted
around
for
a
place
to
attach
the
rope
.
The
trouble
was
,
our
house
had
the
wrong
kind
of
ceilings
.
The
ceilings
were
low
,
white
and
smoothly
plastered
,
without
a
light
fixture
or
a
wood
beam
in
sight
.
I
thought
with
longing
of
the
house
my
grandmother
had
before
she
sold
it
to
come
and
live
with
us
,
and
then
with
my
Aunt
Libby
.
My
grandmother
's
house
was
built
in
the
fine
,
nineteenth-century
style
,
with
lofty
rooms
and
sturdy
chandelier
brackets
and
high
closets
with
stout
rails
across
them
,
and
an
attic
where
nobody
ever
went
,
full
of
trunks
and
parrot
cages
and
dressmakers
'
dummies
and
overhead
beams
thick
as
a
ship
's
timbers
.
But
it
was
an
old
house
,
and
she
'd
sold
it
,
and
I
did
n't
know
anybody
else
with
a
house
like
that
.
After
a
discouraging
time
of
walking
about
with
the
silk
cord
dangling
from
my
neck
like
a
yellow
cat
's
tail
and
finding
no
place
to
fasten
it
,
I
sat
on
the
edge
of
my
mother
's
bed
and
tried
pulling
the
cord
tight
.
But
each
time
I
would
get
the
cord
so
tight
I
could
feel
a
rushing
in
my
ears
and
a
flush
of
blood
in
my
face
,
my
hands
would
weaken
and
let
go
,
and
I
would
be
all
right
again
.
Then
I
saw
that
my
body
had
all
sorts
of
little
tricks
,
such
as
making
my
hands
go
limp
at
the
crucial
second
,
which
would
save
it
,
time
and
again
,
whereas
if
I
had
the
whole
say
,
I
would
be
dead
in
a
flash
.
I
would
simply
have
to
ambush
it
with
whatever
sense
I
had
left
,
or
it
would
trap
me
in
its
stupid
cage
for
fifty
years
without
any
sense
at
all
.
And
when
people
found
out
my
mind
had
gone
,
as
they
would
have
to
,
sooner
or
later
,
in
spite
of
my
mother
's
guarded
tongue
,
they
would
persuade
her
to
put
me
into
an
asylum
where
I
could
be
cured
.
Only
my
case
was
incurable
.
I
had
bought
a
few
paperbacks
on
abnormal
psychology
at
the
drugstore
and
compared
my
symptoms
with
the
symptoms
in
the
books
,
and
sure
enough
,
my
symptoms
tallied
with
the
most
hopeless
cases
.
The
only
thing
I
could
read
,
besides
the
scandal
sheets
,
were
those
abnormal-
psychology
books
.
It
was
as
if
some
slim
opening
had
been
left
,
so
I
could
learn
all
I
needed
to
know
about
my
case
to
end
it
in
the
proper
way
.
I
wondered
,
after
the
hanging
fiasco
,
if
I
should
n't
just
give
it
up
and
turn
myself
over
to
the
doctors
,
and
then
I
remembered
Doctor
Gordon
and
his
private
shock
machine
.
Once
I
was
locked
up
they
could
use
that
on
me
all
the
time
.
And
I
thought
of
how
my
mother
and
brother
and
friends
would
visit
me
,
day
after
day
,
hoping
I
would
be
better
.
Then
their
visits
would
slacken
off
,
and
they
would
give
up
hope
.
They
would
grow
old
.
They
would
forget
me
.
They
would
be
poor
,
too
.
They
would
want
me
to
have
the
best
of
care
at
first
,
so
they
would
sink
all
their
money
in
a
private
hospital
like
Doctor
Gordon
's
.
Finally
,
when
the
money
was
used
up
,
I
would
be
moved
to
a
state
hospital
,
with
hundreds
of
people
like
me
,
in
a
big
cage
in
the
basement
.
The
more
hopeless
you
were
,
the
further
away
they
hid
you
.
Cal
had
turned
around
and
was
swimming
in
.
As
I
watched
,
he
dragged
himself
slowly
out
of
the
neck-deep
sea
.
Against
the
khaki-colored
sand
and
the
green
shore
wavelets
,
his
body
was
bisected
for
a
moment
,
like
a
white
worm
.
Then
it
crawled
completely
out
of
the
green
and
onto
the
khaki
and
lost
itself
among
dozens
and
dozens
of
other
worms
that
were
wriggling
or
just
lolling
about
between
the
sea
and
the
sky
.
I
paddled
my
hands
in
the
water
and
kicked
my
feet
.
The
egg-shaped
rock
did
n't
seem
to
be
any
nearer
than
it
had
been
when
Cal
and
I
had
looked
at
it
from
the
shore
.
Then
I
saw
it
would
be
pointless
to
swim
as
far
as
the
rock
,
because
my
body
would
take
that
excuse
to
climb
out
and
lie
in
the
sun
,
gathering
strength
to
swim
back
.
The
only
thing
to
do
was
to
drown
myself
then
and
there
.
So
I
stopped
.
I
brought
my
hands
to
my
breast
,
ducked
my
head
,
and
dived
,
using
my
hands
to
push
the
water
aside
.
The
water
pressed
in
on
my
eardrums
and
on
my
heart
.
I
fanned
myself
down
,
but
before
I
knew
where
I
was
,
the
water
had
spat
me
up
into
the
sun
,
the
world
was
sparkling
all
about
me
like
blue
and
green
and
yellow
semi-precious
stones
.
I
dashed
the
water
from
my
eyes
.
I
was
panting
,
as
after
a
strenuous
exertion
,
but
floating
,
without
effort
.
I
dived
,
and
dived
again
,
and
each
time
popped
up
like
a
cork
.
The
gray
rock
mocked
me
,
bobbing
on
the
water
easy
as
a
lifebuoy
.
I
knew
when
I
was
beaten
.
I
turned
back
.
The
flowers
nodded
like
bright
,
knowledgeable
children
as
I
trundled
them
down
the
hall
.
I
felt
silly
in
my
sage-green
volunteer
's
uniform
,
and
superfluous
,
unlike
the
white-uniformed
doctors
and
nurses
,
ot
even
the
brown-uniformed
scrubwomen
with
their
mops
and
their
buckets
of
grimy
water
,
who
passed
me
without
a
word
.
If
I
had
been
getting
paid
,
no
matter
how
little
,
I
could
at
least
count
this
a
proper
job
,
but
all
I
got
for
a
morning
of
pushing
round
magazines
and
candy
and
flowers
was
a
free
lunch
.
My
mother
said
the
cure
for
thinking
too
much
about
yourself
was
helping
somebody
who
was
worse
off
than
you
,
so
Teresa
had
arranged
for
me
to
sign
on
as
a
volunteer
at
our
local
hospital
.
It
was
difficult
to
be
a
volunteer
at
this
hospital
,
because
that
's
what
all
the
Junior
League
women
wanted
to
do
,
but
luckily
for
me
,
a
lot
of
them
were
away
on
vacation
.
I
had
hoped
they
would
send
me
to
a
ward
with
some
really
gruesome
cases
,
who
would
see
through
my
numb
,
dumb
face
to
how
I
meant
well
,
and
be
grateful
.
But
the
head
of
the
volunteers
,
a
society
lady
at
our
church
,
took
one
look
at
me
and
said
,
``
You
're
on
maternity
.
''
So
I
rode
the
elevator
up
three
flights
to
the
maternity
ward
and
reported
to
the
head
nurse
.
She
gave
me
the
trolley
of
flowers
.
I
was
supposed
to
put
the
right
vases
at
the
right
beds
in
the
right
rooms
.
But
before
I
came
to
the
door
of
the
first
room
I
noticed
that
a
lot
of
the
flowers
were
droopy
and
brown
at
the
edges
.
I
thought
it
would
be
discouraging
for
a
woman
who
'd
just
had
a
baby
to
see
somebody
plonk
down
a
big
bouquet
of
dead
flowers
in
front
of
her
,
so
I
steered
the
trolley
to
a
washbasin
in
an
alcove
in
the
hall
and
began
to
pick
out
all
the
flowers
that
were
dead
.
Then
I
picked
out
all
those
that
were
dying
.
There
was
no
wastebasket
in
sight
,
so
I
crumpled
the
flowers
up
and
laid
them
in
the
deep
white
basin
.
The
basin
felt
cold
as
a
tomb
.
I
smiled
.
This
must
be
how
they
laid
the
bodies
away
in
the
hospital
morgue
.
My
gesture
,
in
its
small
way
,
echoed
the
larger
gesture
of
the
doctors
and
nurses
.
I
swung
the
door
of
the
first
room
open
and
walked
in
,
dragging
my
trolley
.
A
couple
of
nurses
jumped
up
,
and
I
had
a
confused
impression
of
shelves
and
medicine
cabinets
.
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
one
of
the
nurses
demanded
sternly
.
I
could
n't
tell
one
from
the
other
,
they
all
looked
just
alike
.
``
I
'm
taking
the
flowers
round
.
''
The
nurse
who
had
spoken
put
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
led
me
out
of
the
room
,
maneuvering
the
trolley
with
her
free
,
expert
hand
.
She
flung
open
the
swinging
doors
of
the
room
next
to
that
one
and
bowed
me
in
.
Then
she
disappeared
.
I
could
hear
giggles
in
the
distance
till
a
door
shut
and
cut
them
off
.
There
were
six
beds
in
the
room
,
and
each
bed
had
a
woman
in
it
.
The
women
were
all
sitting
up
and
knitting
or
riffling
through
magazines
or
putting
their
hair
in
pin
curls
and
chattering
like
parrots
in
a
parrot
house
.
I
had
thought
they
would
be
sleeping
,
or
lying
quiet
and
pale
,
so
I
could
tiptoe
round
without
any
trouble
and
match
the
bed
numbers
to
the
numbers
inked
on
adhesive
tape
on
the
vases
,
but
before
I
had
a
chance
to
get
my
bearings
,
a
bright
,
jazzy
blonde
with
a
sharp
,
triangular
face
beckoned
to
me
.
I
approached
her
,
leaving
the
trolley
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
,
but
then
she
made
an
impatient
gesture
,
and
I
saw
she
wanted
me
to
bring
the
trolley
too
.
I
wheeled
the
trolley
over
to
her
bedside
with
a
helpful
smile
.
``
Hey
,
where
's
my
larkspur
?
''
A
large
,
flabby
lady
from
across
the
ward
raked
me
with
an
eagle
eye
.
The
sharp-faced
blonde
bent
over
the
trolley
.
``
Here
are
my
yellow
roses
,
''
she
said
,
``
but
they
're
all
mixed
up
with
some
lousy
iris
.
''
Other
voices
joined
the
voices
of
the
first
two
women
.
They
sounded
cross
and
loud
and
full
of
complaint
.
I
was
opening
my
mouth
to
explain
that
I
had
thrown
a
bunch
of
dead
larkspur
in
the
sink
,
and
that
some
of
the
vases
I
had
weeded
out
looked
skimpy
,
there
were
so
few
flowers
left
,
so
I
had
joined
a
few
of
the
bouquets
together
to
fill
them
out
,
when
the
swinging
door
flew
open
and
a
nurse
stalked
in
to
see
what
the
commotion
was
.
``
Listen
,
nurse
,
I
had
this
big
bunch
of
larkspur
Larry
brought
last
night
.
''
``
She
's
loused
up
my
yellow
roses
.
''
Unbuttoning
the
green
uniform
as
I
ran
,
I
stuffed
it
,
in
passing
,
into
the
washbasin
with
the
rubbish
of
dead
flowers
.
Then
I
took
the
deserted
side
steps
down
to
the
street
two
at
a
time
,
without
meeting
another
soul
``
Which
way
is
the
graveyard
?
''
The
Italian
in
the
black
leather
jacket
stopped
and
pointed
down
an
alley
behind
the
white
Methodist
church
.
I
remembered
the
Methodist
church
.
I
had
been
a
Methodist
for
the
first
nine
years
of
my
life
,
before
my
father
died
and
we
moved
and
turned
Unitarian
.
My
mother
had
been
a
Catholic
before
she
was
a
Methodist
.
My
grandmother
and
my
grandfather
and
my
Aunt
Libby
were
all
still
Catholics
.
My
Aunt
Libby
had
broken
away
from
the
Catholic
Church
at
the
same
time
my
mother
did
,
but
then
she
'd
fallen
in
love
with
an
Italian
Catholic
,
so
she
'd
gone
back
again
.
Lately
I
had
considered
going
into
the
Catholic
Church
myself
.
I
knew
the
Catholics
thought
killing
yourself
was
an
awful
sin
.
But
perhaps
,
if
this
was
so
,
they
might
have
a
good
way
to
persuade
me
out
of
it
Of
course
,
I
did
n't
believe
in
life
after
death
or
the
virgin
birth
or
the
Inquisition
or
the
infallibility
of
that
little
monkey-faced
Pope
or
anything
,
but
I
did
n't
have
to
let
the
priest
see
this
,
I
could
just
concentrate
on
my
sin
,
and
he
would
help
me
repent
.
The
only
trouble
was
,
Church
,
even
the
Catholic
Church
,
did
n't
take
up
the
whole
of
your
life
.
No
matter
how
much
you
knelt
and
prayed
,
you
still
had
to
eat
three
meals
a
day
and
have
a
job
and
live
in
the
world
.
I
thought
I
might
see
how
long
you
had
to
be
a
Catholic
before
you
became
a
nun
,
so
I
asked
my
mother
,
thinking
she
'd
know
the
best
way
to
go
about
it
.
My
mother
had
laughed
at
me
.
``
Do
you
think
they
'll
take
somebody
like
you
,
right
off
the
bat
?
Why
you
've
got
to
know
all
these
catechisms
and
credos
and
believe
in
them
,
lock
,
stock
and
barrel
.
A
girl
with
your
sense
!
''
Still
,
I
imagined
myself
going
to
some
Boston
priest
--
it
would
have
to
be
Boston
,
because
I
did
n't
want
any
priest
in
my
home
town
to
know
I
'd
thought
of
killing
myself
.
Priests
were
terrible
gossips
.
I
would
be
in
black
,
with
my
dead
white
face
,
and
I
would
throw
myself
at
this
priest
's
feet
and
say
,
``
O
Father
,
help
me
.
''
But
that
was
before
people
had
begun
to
look
at
me
in
a
funny
way
,
like
those
nurses
in
the
hospital
.
I
was
pretty
sure
the
Catholics
would
n't
take
in
any
crazy
nuns
.
My
Aunt
Libby
's
husband
had
made
a
joke
once
,
about
a
nun
that
a
nunnery
sent
to
Teresa
for
a
checkup
.
This
nun
kept
hearing
harp
notes
in
her
ears
and
a
voice
saying
over
and
over
,
``
Alleluia
!
''
Only
she
was
n't
sure
,
on
being
closely
questioned
,
whether
the
voice
was
saying
Alleluia
or
Arizona
.
The
nun
had
been
born
in
Arizona
.
I
think
she
ended
up
in
some
asylum
.
I
tugged
my
black
veil
down
to
my
chin
and
strode
in
through
the
wrought-iron
gates
.
I
thought
it
odd
that
in
all
the
time
my
father
had
been
buried
in
this
graveyard
,
none
of
us
had
ever
visited
him
.
My
mother
had
n't
let
us
come
to
his
funeral
because
we
were
only
children
then
,
and
he
had
died
in
the
hospital
,
so
the
graveyard
and
even
his
death
had
always
seemed
unreal
to
me
.
I
had
a
great
yearning
,
lately
,
to
pay
my
father
back
for
all
the
years
of
neglect
,
and
start
tending
his
grave
.
I
had
always
been
my
father
's
favorite
,
and
it
seemed
fitting
I
should
take
on
a
mourning
my
mother
had
never
bothered
with
.
I
thought
that
if
my
father
had
n't
died
,
he
would
have
taught
me
all
about
insects
,
which
was
his
specialty
at
the
university
.
He
would
also
have
taught
me
German
and
Greek
and
Latin
,
which
he
knew
,
and
perhaps
I
would
be
a
Lutheran
.
My
father
had
been
a
Lutheran
in
Wisconsin
,
but
they
were
out
of
style
in
New
England
,
so
he
had
become
a
lapsed
Lutheran
and
then
,
my
mother
said
,
a
bitter
atheist
.
The
graveyard
disappointed
me
.
It
lay
at
the
outskirts
of
the
town
,
on
low
ground
,
like
a
rubbish
dump
,
and
as
I
walked
up
and
down
the
gravel
paths
,
I
could
smell
the
stagnant
salt
marshes
in
the
distance
.
The
old
part
of
the
graveyard
was
all
right
,
with
its
worn
,
flat
stones
and
lichen-
bitten
monuments
,
but
I
soon
saw
my
father
must
be
buried
in
the
modern
part
with
dates
in
the
nineteen
forties
.
The
stones
in
the
modern
part
were
crude
and
cheap
,
and
here
and
there
a
grave
was
rimmed
with
marble
,
like
an
oblong
bathtub
full
of
dirt
,
and
rusty
metal
containers
stuck
up
about
where
the
person
's
navel
would
be
,
full
of
plastic
flowers
.
A
fine
drizzle
started
drifting
down
from
the
gray
sky
,
and
I
grew
very
depressed
.
I
could
n't
find
my
father
anywhere
.
Low
,
shaggy
clouds
scudded
over
that
part
of
the
horizon
where
the
sea
lay
,
behind
the
marshes
and
the
beach
shanty
settlements
,
and
raindrops
darkened
the
black
mackintosh
I
had
bought
that
morning
.
A
clammy
dampness
sank
through
to
my
skin
.
I
had
asked
the
salesgirl
,
``
Is
it
water-repellent
?
''
And
she
had
said
,
``
No
raincoat
is
ever
water-repellent
.
It
's
showerproofed
.
''
And
when
I
asked
her
what
showerproofed
was
,
she
told
me
I
had
better
buy
an
umbrella
.
But
I
had
n't
enough
money
for
an
umbrella
.
What
with
bus
fare
in
and
out
of
Boston
and
peanuts
and
newspapers
and
abnormal-psychology
books
and
trips
to
my
old
home
town
by
the
sea
,
my
New
York
fund
was
almost
exhausted
.
I
had
decided
that
when
there
was
no
more
money
in
my
bank
account
I
would
do
it
,
and
that
morning
I
'd
spent
the
last
of
it
on
the
black
raincoat
.
Then
I
saw
my
father
's
gravestone
.
It
was
crowded
right
up
by
another
gravestone
,
head
to
head
,
the
way
people
are
crowded
in
a
charity
ward
when
there
is
n't
enough
space
.
The
stone
was
of
a
mottled
pink
marble
,
like
canned
salmon
,
and
all
there
was
on
it
was
my
father
's
name
and
,
under
it
,
two
dates
,
separated
by
a
little
dash
.
At
the
foot
of
the
stone
I
arranged
the
rainy
armful
of
azaleas
I
had
picked
from
a
bush
at
the
gateway
of
the
graveyard
.
Then
my
legs
folded
under
me
,
and
I
sat
down
in
the
sopping
grass
.
I
could
n't
understand
why
I
was
crying
so
hard
.
Then
I
remembered
that
I
had
never
cried
for
my
father
's
death
.
My
mother
had
n't
cried
either
.
She
had
just
smiled
and
said
what
a
merciful
thing
it
was
for
him
he
had
died
,
because
if
he
had
lived
he
would
have
been
crippled
and
an
invalid
for
life
,
and
he
could
n't
have
stood
that
,
he
would
rather
have
died
than
had
that
happen
.
I
laid
my
face
to
the
smooth
face
of
the
marble
and
howled
my
loss
into
the
cold
salt
rain
.
I
knew
just
how
to
go
about
it
The
minute
the
car
tires
crunched
off
down
the
drive
and
the
sound
of
the
motor
faded
,
I
jumped
out
of
bed
and
hurried
into
my
white
blouse
and
green
figured
skirt
and
black
raincoat
.
The
raincoat
felt
damp
still
,
from
the
day
before
,
but
that
would
soon
cease
to
matter
.
I
went
downstairs
and
picked
up
a
pale
blue
envelope
from
the
dining
room
table
and
scrawled
on
the
back
,
in
large
,
painstaking
letters
:
I
am
going
for
a
long
walk
.
I
propped
the
message
where
my
mother
would
see
it
the
minute
she
came
in
.
Then
I
laughed
.
I
had
forgotten
the
most
Important
thing
.
I
ran
upstairs
and
dragged
a
chair
into
my
mother
's
closet
.
Then
I
climbed
up
and
reached
for
the
small
green
strongbox
on
the
top
shelf
.
I
could
have
torn
the
metal
cover
off
with
my
bare
hands
,
the
lock
was
so
feeble
,
but
I
wanted
to
do
things
in
a
calm
,
orderly
way
.
I
pulled
out
my
mother
's
upper
right-hand
bureau
drawer
and
slipped
the
blue
jewelry
box
from
its
hiding
place
under
the
scented
Irish
linen
handkerchiefs
.
I
unpinned
the
little
key
from
the
dark
velvet
.
Then
I
unlocked
the
strongbox
and
took
out
the
bottle
of
new
pills
.
There
were
more
than
I
had
hoped
.
There
were
at
least
fifty
.
If
I
had
waited
until
my
mother
doled
them
out
to
me
,
night
by
night
,
it
would
have
taken
me
fifty
nights
to
save
up
enough
.
And
in
fifty
nights
,
college
would
have
opened
,
and
my
brother
would
have
come
back
from
Germany
,
and
it
would
be
too
late
.
I
pinned
the
key
back
in
the
jewelry
box
among
the
clutter
of
inexpensive
chains
and
rings
,
put
the
jewelry
box
back
in
the
drawer
under
the
handkerchiefs
,
returned
the
strongbox
to
the
closet
shelf
and
set
the
chair
on
the
rug
in
the
exact
spot
I
had
dragged
it
from
.
Then
I
went
downstairs
and
into
the
kitchen
.
I
turned
on
the
tap
and
poured
myself
a
tall
glass
of
water
.
Then
I
took
the
glass
of
water
and
the
bottle
of
pills
and
went
down
into
the
cellar
.
A
dim
,
undersea
light
filtered
through
the
slits
of
the
cellar
windows
.
Behind
the
oil
burner
,
a
dark
gap
showed
in
the
wall
at
about
shoulder
height
and
ran
back
under
the
breezeway
,
out
of
sight
.
The
breezeway
had
been
added
to
the
house
after
the
cellar
was
dug
,
and
built
out
over
this
secret
,
earth-bottomed
crevice
.
A
few
old
,
rotting
fireplace
logs
blocked
the
hole
mouth
.
I
shoved
them
back
a
bit
.
Then
I
set
the
glass
of
water
and
the
bottle
of
pills
side
by
side
on
the
flat
surface
of
one
of
the
logs
and
started
to
heave
myself
up
.
It
took
me
a
good
while
to
heft
my
body
into
the
gap
,
but
at
last
,
after
many
tries
,
I
managed
it
,
and
crouched
at
the
mouth
of
the
darkness
,
like
a
troll
.
The
earth
seemed
friendly
under
my
bare
feet
,
but
cold
.
I
wondered
how
long
it
had
been
since
this
particular
square
of
soil
had
seen
the
sun
.
Then
,
one
after
the
other
,
I
lugged
the
heavy
,
dust-covered
logs
across
the
hole
mouth
.
The
dark
felt
thick
as
velvet
.
I
reached
for
the
glass
and
bottle
,
and
carefully
,
on
my
knees
,
with
bent
head
,
crawled
to
the
farthest
wall
Cobwebs
touched
my
face
with
the
softness
of
moths
.
Wrapping
my
black
coat
round
me
like
my
own
sweet
shadow
,
I
unscrewed
the
bottle
of
pills
and
started
taking
them
swiftly
,
between
gulps
of
water
,
one
by
one
by
one
.
At
first
nothing
happened
,
but
as
I
approached
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
,
red
and
blue
lights
began
to
flash
before
my
eyes
.
The
bottle
slid
from
my
fingers
and
I
lay
down
.
The
silence
drew
off
,
baring
the
pebbles
and
shells
and
all
the
tatty
wreckage
of
my
life
.
Then
,
at
the
rim
of
vision
,
it
gathered
itself
,
and
in
one
sweeping
tide
,
rushed
me
to
sleep
.
Fourteen
It
was
completely
dark
.
I
felt
the
darkness
,
but
nothing
else
,
and
my
head
rose
,
feeling
it
,
like
the
head
of
a
worm
.
Someone
was
moaning
.
Then
a
great
,
hard
weight
smashed
against
my
cheek
like
a
stone
wall
and
the
moaning
stopped
.
The
silence
surged
back
,
smoothing
itself
as
black
water
smooths
to
its
old
surface
calm
over
a
dropped
stone
.
A
cool
wind
rushed
by
.
I
was
being
transported
at
enormous
speed
down
a
tunnel
into
the
earth
.
Then
the
wind
stopped
.
There
was
a
rumbling
,
as
of
many
voices
,
protesting
and
disagreeing
in
the
distance
.
Then
the
voices
stopped
.
A
chisel
cracked
down
on
my
eye
,
and
a
slit
of
light
opened
,
like
a
mouth
or
a
wound
,
till
the
darkness
clamped
shut
on
it
again
.
I
tried
to
roll
away
from
the
direction
of
the
light
,
but
hands
wrapped
round
my
limbs
like
mummy
bands
,
and
I
could
n't
move
.
I
began
to
think
I
must
be
in
an
underground
chamber
,
lit
by
blinding
lights
,
and
that
the
chamber
was
full
of
people
who
for
some
reason
were
holding
me
down
.
Then
the
chisel
struck
again
,
and
the
light
leapt
into
my
head
,
and
through
the
thick
,
warm
,
furry
dark
,
a
voice
cried
,
``
Mother
!
''
Air
breathed
and
played
over
my
face
.
I
felt
the
shape
of
a
room
around
me
,
a
big
room
with
open
windows
.
A
pillow
molded
itself
under
my
head
,
and
my
body
floated
,
without
pressure
,
between
thin
sheets
.
Then
I
felt
warmth
,
like
a
hand
on
my
face
.
I
must
be
lying
in
the
sun
.
If
I
opened
my
eyes
,
I
would
see
colors
and
shapes
bending
in
upon
me
like
nurses
.
I
opened
my
eyes
.
It
was
completely
dark
.
Somebody
was
breathing
beside
me
.
``
I
ca
n't
see
,
''
I
said
.
A
cheery
voice
spoke
out
of
the
dark
.
``
There
are
lots
of
blind
people
in
the
world
.
You
'll
marry
a
nice
blind
man
someday
.
''
The
man
with
the
chisel
had
come
back
.
``
Why
do
you
bother
?
''
I
said
.
``
It
's
no
use
.
''
``
You
mus
n't
talk
like
that
.
''
His
fingers
probed
at
the
great
,
aching
boss
over
my
left
eye
.
Then
he
loosened
something
,
and
a
ragged
gap
of
light
appeared
,
like
the
hole
in
a
wall
.
A
man
's
hand
peered
round
the
edge
of
it
.
``
Can
you
see
me
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
``
Can
you
see
anything
else
?
''
Then
I
remembered
.
``
I
ca
n't
see
anything
.
''
The
gap
narrowed
and
went
dark
.
``
I
'm
blind
.
''
``
Nonsense
!
Who
told
you
that
?
''
``
The
nurse
.
''
The
man
snorted
.
He
finished
taping
the
bandage
back
over
my
eye
.
``
You
are
a
very
lucky
girl
Your
sight
is
perfectly
intact
.
''
``
Somebody
to
see
you
.
''
The
nurse
beamed
and
disappeared
.
My
mother
came
smiling
round
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
She
was
wearing
a
dress
with
purple
cartwheels
on
it
and
she
looked
awful
.
A
big
tall
boy
followed
her
.
At
first
I
could
n't
make
out
who
it
was
,
because
my
eye
only
opened
a
short
way
,
but
then
I
saw
it
was
my
brother
.
``
They
said
you
wanted
to
see
me
.
''
My
mother
perched
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
laid
a
hand
on
my
leg
.
She
looked
loving
and
reproachful
,
and
I
wanted
her
to
go
away
.
``
I
did
n't
think
I
said
anything
.
''
``
They
said
you
called
for
me
.
''
She
seemed
ready
to
cry
.
Her
face
puckered
up
and
quivered
like
a
pale
jelly
.
``
How
are
you
?
''
my
brother
said
.
I
looked
my
mother
in
the
eye
.
``
The
same
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
have
a
visitor
.
''
``
I
do
n't
want
a
visitor
.
''
The
nurse
bustled
out
and
whispered
to
somebody
In
the
hall
.
Then
she
came
back
.
``
He
'd
very
much
like
to
see
you
.
''
I
looked
down
at
the
yellow
legs
sticking
out
of
the
unfamiliar
white
silk
pajamas
they
had
dressed
me
in
.
The
skin
shook
flabbily
when
I
moved
,
as
if
there
was
n't
a
muscle
in
it
,
and
it
was
covered
with
a
short
,
thick
stubble
of
black
hair
.
``
Who
is
it
?
''
``
Somebody
you
know
.
''
``
What
's
his
name
?
''
``
George
Bakewell
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
any
George
Bakewell
.
''
``
He
says
he
knows
you
.
''
Then
the
nurse
went
out
,
and
a
very
familiar
boy
came
in
and
said
,
``
Mind
if
I
sit
on
the
edge
of
your
bed
?
''
He
was
wearing
a
white
coat
,
and
I
could
see
a
stethoscope
poking
out
of
his
pocket
.
I
thought
it
must
be
somebody
I
knew
dressed
up
as
a
doctor
.
I
had
meant
to
cover
my
legs
if
anybody
came
in
,
but
now
I
saw
it
was
too
late
,
so
I
let
them
stick
out
,
just
as
they
were
,
disgusting
and
ugly
.
``
That
's
me
,
''
I
thought
.
``
That
's
what
I
am
.
''
``
You
remember
me
,
do
n't
you
,
Esther
?
''
I
squinted
at
the
boy
's
face
through
the
crack
of
my
good
eye
.
The
other
eye
had
n't
opened
yet
,
but
the
eye
doctor
said
it
would
be
all
right
in
a
few
days
.
The
boy
looked
at
me
as
if
I
were
some
exciting
new
zoo
animal
and
he
was
about
to
burst
out
laughing
.
``
You
remember
me
,
do
n't
you
,
Esther
?
''
He
spoke
slowly
,
the
way
one
speaks
to
a
dull
child
.
``
I
'm
George
Bakewell
.
I
go
to
your
church
.
You
dated
my
roommate
once
at
Amherst
.
''
I
thought
I
placed
the
boy
's
face
then
.
It
hovered
dimly
at
the
rim
of
memory
--
the
sort
of
face
to
which
I
would
never
bother
to
attach
a
name
.
``
What
are
you
doing
here
?
''
``
I
'm
houseman
at
this
hospital
.
''
How
could
this
George
Bakewell
have
become
a
doctor
so
suddenly
?
I
wondered
.
He
did
n't
really
know
me
,
either
.
He
just
wanted
to
see
what
a
girl
who
was
crazy
enough
to
kill
herself
looked
like
.
I
turned
my
face
to
the
wall
.
``
Get
out
,
''
I
said
.
``
Get
the
hell
out
and
do
n't
come
back
.
''
``
I
want
to
see
a
mirror
.
''
The
nurse
hummed
busily
as
she
opened
one
drawer
after
another
,
stuffing
the
new
underclothes
and
blouses
and
skirts
and
pajamas
my
mother
had
bought
me
into
the
black
patent
leather
overnight
case
.
``
Why
ca
n't
I
see
a
mirror
?
''
I
had
been
dressed
in
a
sheath
,
striped
gray
and
white
,
like
mattress
ticking
,
with
a
wide
,
shiny
red
belt
,
and
they
had
propped
me
up
in
an
armchair
.
``
Why
ca
n't
I
?
''
``
Because
you
better
not
.
''
The
nurse
shut
the
lid
of
the
overnight
case
with
a
little
snap
.
``
Why
?
''
``
Because
you
do
n't
look
very
pretty
.
''
``
Oh
,
just
let
me
see
.
''
The
nurse
sighed
and
opened
the
top
bureau
drawer
.
She
took
out
a
large
mirror
in
a
wooden
frame
that
matched
the
wood
of
the
bureau
and
handed
it
to
me
.
At
first
I
did
n't
see
what
the
trouble
was
.
It
was
n't
a
mirror
at
all
,
but
a
picture
.
You
could
n't
tell
whether
the
person
in
the
picture
was
a
man
or
a
woman
,
because
their
hair
was
shaved
off
and
sprouted
in
bristly
chicken-feather
tufts
all
over
their
head
.
One
side
of
the
person
's
face
was
purple
,
and
bulged
out
in
a
shapeless
way
,
shading
to
green
along
the
edges
,
and
then
to
a
sallow
yellow
.
The
person
's
mouth
was
pale
brown
,
with
a
rose-colored
sore
at
either
corner
.
The
most
startling
thing
about
the
face
was
its
supernatural
conglomeration
of
bright
colors
.
I
smiled
.
The
mouth
in
the
mirror
cracked
into
a
grin
.
A
minute
after
the
crash
another
nurse
ran
in
.
She
took
one
look
at
the
broken
mirror
,
and
at
me
,
standing
over
the
blind
,
white
pieces
,
and
hustled
the
young
nurse
out
of
the
room
.
``
Did
n't
I
tell
you
,
''
I
could
hear
her
say
.
``
But
I
only
.
.
.
''
``
Did
n't
I
tell
you
!
''
I
listened
with
mild
interest
.
Anybody
could
drop
a
mirror
.
I
did
n't
see
why
they
should
get
so
stirred
up
.
The
other
,
older
nurse
came
back
into
the
room
.
She
stood
there
,
arms
folded
,
staring
hard
at
me
.
``
Seven
years
'
bad
luck
''
``
What
?
''
``
I
said
,
''
the
nurse
raised
her
voice
,
as
if
speaking
to
a
deaf
person
,
``
seven
years
'
bad
luck
.
''
The
young
nurse
returned
with
a
dustpan
and
brush
and
began
to
sweep
up
the
glittery
splinters
.
``
That
's
only
a
superstition
,
''
I
said
then
.
``
Huh
!
''
The
second
nurse
addressed
herself
to
the
nurse
on
her
hands
and
knees
as
if
I
was
n't
there
.
``
At
you-know-where
they
'll
take
care
of
her
!
''
From
the
back
window
of
the
ambulance
I
could
see
street
after
familiar
street
funneling
off
into
a
summery
green
distance
.
My
mother
sat
on
one
side
of
me
,
and
my
brother
on
the
other
.
I
had
pretended
I
did
n't
know
why
they
were
moving
me
from
the
hospital
in
my
home
town
to
a
city
hospital
,
to
see
what
they
would
say
.
``
They
want
you
to
be
in
a
special
ward
,
''
my
mother
said
.
``
They
do
n't
have
that
sort
of
ward
at
our
hospital
.
''
``
I
liked
it
where
I
was
.
''
My
mother
's
mouth
tightened
.
``
You
should
have
behaved
better
,
then
.
''
``
What
?
''
``
You
should
n't
have
broken
that
mirror
.
Then
maybe
they
'd
have
let
you
stay
.
''
But
of
course
I
knew
the
mirror
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
I
sat
in
bed
with
the
covers
up
to
my
neck
.
``
Why
ca
n't
I
get
up
?
I
'm
not
sick
.
''
``
Ward
rounds
,
''
the
nurse
said
.
``
You
can
get
up
after
ward
rounds
.
''
She
shoved
the
bed
curtains
back
and
revealed
a
fat
young
Italian
woman
in
the
next
bed
.
The
Italian
woman
had
a
mass
of
tight
black
curls
,
starting
at
her
forehead
,
that
rose
in
a
mountainous
pompadour
and
cascaded
down
her
back
.
Whenever
she
moved
,
the
huge
arrangement
of
hair
moved
with
her
,
as
if
made
of
stiff
black
paper
.
The
woman
looked
at
me
and
giggled
.
``
Why
are
you
here
?
''
She
did
n't
wait
for
an
answer
.
``
I
'm
here
on
account
of
my
French-Canadian
mother-in-law
.
''
She
giggled
again
.
``
My
husband
knows
I
ca
n't
stand
her
,
and
still
he
said
she
could
come
and
visit
us
,
and
when
she
came
,
my
tongue
stuck
out
of
my
head
,
I
could
n't
stop
it
.
They
ran
me
into
Emergency
and
then
they
put
me
up
here
,
''
she
lowered
her
voice
,
``
along
with
the
nuts
.
''
Then
she
said
,
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you
?
''
I
turned
her
my
full
face
,
with
the
bulging
purple
and
green
eye
.
``
I
tried
to
kill
myself
.
''
The
woman
stared
at
me
.
Then
,
hastily
,
she
snatched
up
a
movie
magazine
from
her
bed
table
and
pretended
to
be
reading
.
The
swinging
door
opposite
my
bed
flew
open
,
and
a
whole
troop
of
young
boys
and
girls
in
white
coats
came
in
,
with
an
older
,
gray-haired
man
.
They
were
all
smiling
with
bright
,
artificial
smiles
.
They
grouped
themselves
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
.
``
And
how
are
you
feeling
this
morning
,
Miss
Greenwood
?
''
I
tried
to
decide
which
one
of
them
had
spoken
.
I
hate
saying
anything
to
a
group
of
people
.
When
I
talk
to
a
group
of
people
I
always
have
to
single
out
one
and
talk
to
him
,
and
all
the
while
I
am
talking
I
feel
the
others
are
peering
at
me
and
taking
unfair
advantage
.
I
also
hate
people
to
ask
cheerfully
how
you
are
when
they
know
you
're
feeling
like
hell
and
expect
you
to
say
``
Fine
.
''
``
I
feel
lousy
.
''
``
Lousy
.
Hmm
,
''
somebody
said
,
and
a
boy
ducked
his
head
with
a
little
smile
.
Somebody
else
scribbled
something
on
a
clipboard
.
Then
somebody
pulled
a
straight
,
solemn
face
and
said
,
``
And
why
do
you
feel
lousy
?
''
I
thought
some
of
the
boys
and
girls
in
that
bright
group
might
well
be
friends
of
Buddy
Willard
.
They
would
know
I
knew
him
,
and
they
would
be
curious
to
see
me
,
and
afterward
they
would
gossip
about
me
among
themselves
.
I
wanted
to
be
where
nobody
I
knew
could
ever
come
.
``
I
ca
n't
sleep
.
.
.
''
They
interrupted
me
.
``
But
the
nurse
says
you
slept
last
night
.
''
I
looked
around
the
crescent
of
fresh
,
strange
faces
.
``
I
ca
n't
read
.
''
I
raised
my
voice
.
``
I
ca
n't
eat
.
''
It
occurred
to
me
I
'd
been
eating
ravenously
ever
since
I
came
to
.
The
people
in
the
group
had
turned
from
me
and
were
murmuring
in
low
voices
to
each
other
.
Finally
,
the
gray-haired
man
stepped
out
.
``
Thank
you
,
Miss
Greenwood
.
You
will
be
seen
by
one
of
the
staff
doctors
presently
.
''
Then
the
group
moved
on
to
the
bed
of
the
Italian
woman
.
``
And
how
are
you
feeling
today
,
Mrs.
.
.
''
somebody
said
,
and
the
name
sounded
long
and
full
of
I
's
,
like
Mrs.
Tomolillo
.
Mrs.
Tomolillo
giggled
.
``
Oh
,
I
'm
fine
,
doctor
.
I
'm
just
fine
.
''
Then
she
lowered
her
voice
and
whispered
something
I
could
n't
hear
.
One
or
two
people
in
the
group
glanced
in
my
direction
.
Then
somebody
said
,
``
All
right
,
Mrs.
Tomolillo
,
''
and
somebody
stepped
out
and
pulled
the
bed
curtain
between
us
like
a
white
wall
I
sat
on
one
end
of
a
wooden
bench
in
the
grassy
square
between
the
four
brick
walls
of
the
hospital
.
My
mother
,
in
her
purple
cartwheel
dress
,
sat
at
the
other
end
.
She
had
her
head
propped
in
her
hand
,
index
finger
on
her
cheek
and
thumb
under
her
chin
.
Mrs.
Tomolillo
was
sitting
with
some
dark-haired
,
laughing
Italians
on
the
nest
bench
down
.
Every
time
my
mother
moved
,
Mrs.
Tomolillo
imitated
her
.
Now
Mrs.
Tomolillo
was
sitting
with
her
index
finger
on
her
cheek
and
her
thumb
under
her
chin
,
and
her
head
tilted
wistfully
to
one
side
.
``
Do
n't
move
,
''
I
told
my
mother
in
a
low
voice
.
``
That
woman
's
imitating
you
.
''
My
mother
turned
to
glance
round
,
but
quick
as
a
wink
,
Mrs.
Tomolillo
dropped
her
fat
white
hands
in
her
lap
and
started
talking
vigorously
to
her
friends
.
``
Why
no
,
she
's
not
,
''
my
mother
said
.
``
She
's
not
even
paying
any
attention
to
us
.
''
But
the
minute
my
mother
turned
round
to
me
again
,
Mrs.
Tomolillo
matched
the
tips
of
her
fingers
together
the
way
my
mother
had
just
done
and
cast
a
black
,
mocking
look
at
me
.
The
lawn
was
white
with
doctors
.
All
the
time
my
mother
and
I
had
been
sitting
there
,
in
the
narrow
cone
of
sun
that
shone
down
between
the
tall
brick
walls
,
doctors
had
been
coming
up
to
me
and
introducing
themselves
.
``
I
'm
Doctor
Soandso
,
I
'm
Doctor
Soandso
.
''
Some
of
them
looked
so
young
I
knew
they
could
n't
be
proper
doctors
,
and
one
of
them
had
a
queer
name
that
sounded
just
like
Doctor
Syphilis
,
so
I
began
to
look
out
for
suspicious
,
fake
names
,
and
sure
enough
,
a
dark-haired
fellow
who
looked
very
like
Doctor
Gordon
,
except
that
he
had
black
skin
where
Doctor
Gordon
's
skin
was
white
,
came
up
and
said
,
``
I
'm
Doctor
Pancreas
,
''
and
shook
my
hand
.
After
introducing
themselves
,
the
doctors
all
stood
within
listening
distance
,
only
I
could
n't
tell
my
mother
that
they
were
taking
down
every
word
we
said
without
their
hearing
me
,
so
I
leaned
over
and
whispered
into
her
ear
.
My
mother
drew
back
sharply
.
``
Oh
,
Esther
,
I
wish
you
would
cooperate
.
They
say
you
do
n't
cooperate
.
They
say
you
wo
n't
talk
to
any
of
the
doctors
or
make
anything
in
Occupational
Therapy
.
.
.
''
``
I
've
got
to
get
out
of
here
,
''
I
told
her
meaningly
.
``
Then
I
'd
be
all
right
.
You
got
me
in
here
,
''
I
said
.
``
You
get
me
out
.
''
I
thought
if
only
I
could
persuade
my
mother
to
get
me
out
of
the
hospital
I
could
work
on
her
sympathies
,
like
that
boy
with
brain
disease
in
the
play
,
and
convince
her
what
was
the
best
thing
to
do
.
To
my
surprise
,
my
mother
said
,
``
All
right
,
I
'll
try
to
get
you
out
--
even
if
only
to
a
better
place
.
If
I
try
to
get
you
out
,
''
she
laid
a
hand
on
my
knee
,
``
promise
you
'll
be
good
?
''
I
spun
round
and
glared
straight
at
Doctor
Syphilis
,
who
stood
at
my
elbow
taking
notes
on
a
tiny
,
almost
invisible
pad
.
``
I
promise
,
''
I
said
in
a
loud
,
conspicuous
voice
.
The
Negro
wheeled
the
food
cart
into
the
patients
'
dining
room
.
The
Psychiatric
Ward
at
the
hospital
was
very
small
--
just
two
corridors
in
an
L-shape
,
lined
with
rooms
,
and
an
alcove
of
beds
behind
the
OT
shop
,
where
I
was
,
and
a
little
area
with
a
table
and
a
few
seats
by
a
window
in
the
corner
of
the
L
,
which
was
our
lounge
and
dining
room
.
Usually
it
was
a
shrunken
old
white
man
that
brought
our
food
,
but
today
it
was
a
Negro
.
The
Negro
was
with
a
woman
in
blue
stiletto
heels
,
and
she
was
telling
him
what
to
do
.
The
Negro
kept
grinning
and
chuckling
in
a
silly
way
.
Then
he
carried
a
tray
over
to
our
table
with
three
lidded
tin
tureens
on
it
,
and
started
banging
the
tureens
down
.
The
woman
left
the
room
,
locking
the
door
behind
her
.
All
the
time
the
Negro
was
banging
down
the
tureens
and
then
the
dinted
silver
and
the
thick
,
white
china
plates
,
he
gawped
at
us
with
big
,
rolling
eyes
.
I
could
tell
we
were
his
first
crazy
people
.
Nobody
at
the
table
made
a
move
to
take
the
lids
off
the
tin
tureens
,
and
the
nurse
stood
back
to
see
if
any
of
us
would
take
the
lids
off
before
she
came
to
do
it
.
Usually
Mrs.
Tomolillo
had
taken
the
lids
off
and
dished
out
everybody
's
food
like
a
little
mother
,
but
then
they
sent
her
home
,
and
nobody
seemed
to
want
to
take
her
place
.
I
was
starving
,
so
I
lifted
the
lid
off
the
first
bowl
.
``
That
's
very
nice
of
you
,
Esther
,
''
the
nurse
said
pleasantly
.
``
Would
you
like
to
take
some
beans
and
pass
them
round
to
the
others
?
''
I
dished
myself
out
a
helping
of
green
string
beans
and
turned
to
pass
the
tureen
to
the
enormous
red-headed
woman
at
my
right
.
This
was
the
first
time
the
red-headed
woman
had
been
allowed
up
to
the
table
.
I
had
seen
her
once
,
at
,
the
end
of
the
L-shaped
corridor
,
standing
in
front
of
an
open
door
with
bars
on
the
square
,
inset
windows
.
She
had
been
yelling
and
laughing
in
a
rude
way
and
slapping
her
thighs
at
the
passing
doctors
,
and
the
white-jacketed
attendant
who
took
care
of
the
people
in
that
end
of
the
ward
was
leaning
against
the
radiator
,
laughing
himself
sick
.
The
red-headed
woman
snatched
the
tureen
from
me
and
upended
it
on
her
plate
.
Beans
mountained
up
in
front
of
her
and
scattered
over
onto
her
lap
and
onto
the
floor
like
stiff
,
green
straws
.
``
Oh
,
Mrs
.
Mole
!
''
the
nurse
said
in
a
sad
voice
.
``
I
think
you
better
eat
in
your
room
today
.
''
And
she
returned
most
of
the
beans
to
the
tureen
and
gave
it
to
the
person
next
to
Mrs.
Mole
and
led
Mrs.
Mole
off
.
All
the
way
down
the
hall
to
her
room
,
Mrs.
Mole
kept
turning
round
and
making
leering
faces
at
us
,
and
ugly
,
oinking
noises
.
The
Negro
had
come
back
and
was
starting
to
collect
the
empty
plates
of
people
who
had
n't
dished
out
any
beans
yet
.
``
We
're
not
done
,
''
I
told
him
.
``
You
can
just
wait
.
''
``
Mah
,
mah
!
''
The
Negro
widened
his
eyes
in
mock
wonder
.
He
glanced
round
.
The
nurse
had
not
yet
returned
from
locking
up
Mrs.
Mole
.
The
Negro
made
me
an
insolent
bow
.
``
Miss
Mucky-Muck
,
''
he
said
under
his
breath
.
I
lifted
the
lid
off
the
second
tureen
and
uncovered
a
wedge
of
macaroni
,
stone-
cold
and
stuck
together
in
a
gluey
paste
.
The
third
and
last
tureen
was
chock-full
of
baked
beans
.
Now
I
knew
perfectly
well
you
did
n't
serve
two
kinds
of
beans
together
at
a
meal
.
Beans
and
carrots
,
or
beans
and
peas
,
maybe
,
but
never
beans
and
beans
.
The
Negro
was
just
trying
to
see
how
much
we
would
take
.
The
nurse
came
back
,
and
the
Negro
edged
off
at
a
distance
.
I
ate
as
much
as
I
could
of
the
baked
beans
.
Then
I
rose
from
the
table
,
passing
round
to
the
side
where
the
nurse
could
n't
see
me
below
the
waist
,
and
behind
the
Negro
,
who
was
clearing
the
dirty
plates
.
I
drew
my
foot
back
and
gave
him
a
sharp
,
hard
kick
on
the
calf
of
the
leg
.
The
Negro
leapt
away
with
a
yelp
and
rolled
his
eyes
at
me
.
``
Oh
Miz
,
oh
Miz
,
''
he
moaned
,
rubbing
his
leg
.
``
You
should
n't
of
done
that
,
you
should
n't
,
you
reely
should
n't
.
''
``
That
's
what
you
get
,
''
I
said
,
and
stared
him
in
the
eye
.
``
Do
n't
you
want
to
get
up
today
?
''
``
No
.
''
I
huddled
down
more
deeply
in
the
bed
and
pulled
the
sheet
up
over
my
head
.
Then
I
lifted
a
corner
of
the
sheet
and
peered
out
.
The
nurse
was
shaking
down
the
thermometer
she
had
just
removed
from
my
mouth
.
``
You
see
,
it
's
normal
.
''
I
had
looked
at
the
thermometer
before
she
came
to
collect
it
,
the
way
I
always
did
.
``
You
see
,
it
's
normal
,
what
do
you
keep
taking
it
for
?
''
I
wanted
to
tell
her
that
if
only
something
were
wrong
with
my
body
it
would
be
fine
,
I
would
rather
have
anything
wrong
with
my
body
than
something
wrong
with
my
head
,
but
the
idea
seemed
so
involved
and
wearisome
that
I
did
n't
say
anything
.
I
only
burrowed
down
further
in
the
bed
.
Then
,
through
the
sheet
,
I
felt
a
slight
,
annoying
pressure
on
my
leg
.
I
peeped
out
.
The
nurse
had
set
her
tray
of
thermometers
on
my
bed
while
she
turned
her
back
and
took
the
pulse
of
the
person
who
lay
next
to
me
,
in
Mrs.
Tomolillo
's
place
.
A
heavy
naughtiness
pricked
through
my
veins
,
irritating
and
attractive
as
the
hurt
of
a
loose
tooth
.
I
yawned
and
stirred
,
as
if
about
to
turn
over
,
and
edged
my
foot
under
the
box
.
``
Oh
!
''
The
nurse
's
cry
sounded
like
a
cry
for
help
,
and
another
nurse
came
running
.
``
Look
what
you
've
done
!
''
I
poked
my
head
out
of
the
covers
and
stared
over
the
edge
of
the
bed
.
Around
the
overturned
enamel
tray
,
a
star
of
thermometer
shards
glittered
,
and
balls
of
mercury
trembled
like
celestial
dew
.
``
I
'm
sorry
,
''
I
said
.
``
It
was
an
accident
.
''
The
second
nurse
fixed
me
with
a
baleful
eye
.
``
You
did
it
on
purpose
.
I
saw
you
.
''
Then
she
hurried
off
,
and
almost
immediately
two
attendants
came
and
wheeled
me
,
bed
and
all
,
down
to
Mrs.
Mole
's
old
room
,
but
not
before
I
had
scooped
up
a
ball
of
mercury
.
Soon
after
they
had
locked
the
door
,
I
could
see
the
Negro
's
face
,
a
molasses-
colored
moon
,
risen
at
the
window
grating
,
but
I
pretended
not
to
notice
.
I
opened
my
fingers
a
crack
,
like
a
child
with
a
secret
,
and
smiled
at
the
silver
globe
cupped
in
my
palm
.
If
I
dropped
it
,
it
would
break
into
a
million
little
replicas
of
itself
,
and
if
I
pushed
them
near
each
other
,
they
would
fuse
,
without
a
crack
,
into
one
whole
again
.
I
smiled
and
smiled
at
the
small
silver
ball
.
I
could
n't
imagine
what
they
had
done
with
Mrs.
Mole
.
Fifteen
PHILOMENA
GUINEA
'S
black
Cadillac
eased
through
the
tight
,
five
o'clock
traffic
like
a
ceremonial
car
.
Soon
it
would
cross
one
of
the
brief
bridges
that
arched
the
Charles
,
and
I
would
,
without
thinking
,
open
the
door
and
plunge
out
through
the
stream
of
traffic
to
the
rail
of
the
bridge
.
One
jump
and
the
water
would
be
over
my
head
.
Idly
I
twisted
a
Kleenex
to
small
,
pill-sized
pellets
between
my
fingers
and
watched
my
chance
.
I
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
back
seat
of
the
Cadillac
,
my
mother
on
one
side
of
me
,
and
my
brother
on
the
other
,
both
leaning
slightly
forward
,
like
diagonal
bars
,
one
across
each
car
door
.
In
front
of
me
I
could
see
the
Spam-colored
expanse
of
the
chauffeur
's
neck
,
sandwiched
between
a
blue
cap
and
the
shoulders
of
a
blue
jacket
and
,
next
to
him
,
like
a
frail
,
exotic
bird
,
the
silver
hair
and
emerald-feathered
hat
of
Philomena
Guinea
,
the
famous
novelist
.
I
was
n't
quite
sure
why
Mrs
.
Guinea
had
turned
up
.
All
I
knew
was
that
she
had
interested
herself
in
my
case
and
that
at
one
time
,
at
the
peak
of
her
career
,
she
had
been
in
an
asylum
as
well
My
mother
said
that
Mrs
.
Guinea
had
sent
her
a
telegram
from
the
Bahamas
,
where
she
read
about
me
in
a
Boston
paper
.
Mrs
.
Guinea
had
telegrammed
,
``
Is
there
a
boy
in
the
case
?
''
If
there
was
a
boy
in
the
case
,
Mrs
.
Guinea
could
n't
,
of
course
,
have
anything
to
do
with
it
.
But
my
mother
had
telegrammed
back
,
``
No
,
it
is
Esther
's
writing
.
She
thinks
she
will
never
write
again
.
''
So
Mrs
.
Guinea
had
flown
back
to
Boston
and
taken
me
out
of
the
cramped
city
hospital
ward
,
and
now
she
was
driving
me
to
a
private
hospital
that
had
grounds
and
golf
courses
and
gardens
,
like
a
country
club
,
where
she
would
pay
for
me
,
as
if
I
had
a
scholarship
,
until
the
doctors
she
knew
of
there
had
made
me
well
.
My
mother
told
me
I
should
be
grateful
.
She
said
I
had
used
up
almost
all
her
money
,
and
if
it
were
n't
for
Mrs
.
Guinea
she
did
n't
know
where
I
'd
be
.
I
knew
where
I
'd
be
though
.
I
'd
be
in
the
big
state
hospital
in
the
country
,
cheek
by
jowl
to
this
private
place
.
I
knew
I
should
be
grateful
to
Mrs
.
Guinea
,
only
I
could
n't
feel
a
thing
.
If
Mrs
.
Guinea
had
given
me
a
ticket
to
Europe
,
or
a
round-the-world
cruise
,
it
would
n't
have
made
one
scrap
of
difference
to
me
,
because
wherever
I
sat
--
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
or
at
a
street
café
in
Paris
or
Bangkok
--
I
would
be
sitting
under
the
same
glass
bell
jar
,
stewing
in
my
own
sour
air
.
Blue
sky
opened
its
dome
above
the
river
,
and
the
river
was
dotted
with
sails
.
I
readied
myself
,
but
immediately
my
mother
and
my
brother
each
laid
one
hand
on
a
door
handle
.
The
tires
hummed
briefly
over
the
grill
of
the
bridge
.
Water
,
sails
,
blue
sky
and
suspended
gulls
flashed
by
like
an
improbable
postcard
,
and
we
were
across
.
I
sank
back
in
the
gray
,
plush
seat
and
closed
my
eyes
.
The
air
of
the
bell
jar
wadded
round
me
and
I
could
n't
stir
.
I
had
my
own
room
again
.
It
reminded
me
of
the
room
in
Doctor
Gordon
's
hospital
--
a
bed
,
a
bureau
,
a
closet
,
a
table
and
chair
.
A
window
with
a
screen
,
but
no
bars
.
My
room
was
on
the
first
floor
,
and
the
window
,
a
short
distance
above
the
pine-needle-padded
ground
,
overlooked
a
wooded
yard
ringed
by
a
red
brick
wall
.
If
I
jumped
I
would
n't
even
bruise
my
knees
.
The
inner
surface
of
the
tall
wall
seemed
smooth
as
glass
.
The
journey
over
the
bridge
had
unnerved
me
.
I
had
missed
a
perfectly
good
chance
.
The
river
water
passed
me
by
like
an
untouched
drink
.
I
suspected
that
even
if
my
mother
and
brother
had
not
been
there
I
would
have
made
no
move
to
jump
.
When
I
enrolled
in
the
main
building
of
the
hospital
,
a
slim
young
woman
had
come
and
introduced
herself
.
``
My
name
is
Doctor
Nolan
.
I
am
to
be
Esther
's
doctor
.
''
I
was
surprised
to
have
a
woman
.
I
did
n't
think
they
had
woman
psychiatrists
.
This
woman
was
a
cross
between
Myrna
Loy
and
my
mother
.
She
wore
a
white
blouse
and
a
full
skirt
gathered
at
the
waist
by
a
wide
leather
belt
,
and
stylish
,
crescent-shaped
spectacles
.
But
after
a
nurse
had
led
me
across
the
lawn
to
the
gloomy
brick
building
called
Caplan
,
where
I
would
live
,
Doctor
Nolan
did
n't
come
to
see
me
,
a
whole
lot
of
strange
men
came
instead
.
I
lay
on
my
bed
under
the
thick
white
blanket
,
and
they
entered
my
room
,
one
by
one
,
and
introduced
themselves
.
I
could
n't
understand
why
there
should
be
so
many
of
them
,
or
why
they
would
want
to
introduce
themselves
,
and
I
began
to
think
they
were
testing
me
,
to
see
if
I
noticed
there
were
too
many
of
them
,
and
I
grew
wary
.
Finally
,
a
handsome
,
white-haired
doctor
came
in
and
said
he
was
the
director
of
the
hospital
.
Then
he
started
talking
about
the
Pilgrims
and
Indians
and
who
had
the
land
after
them
,
and
what
rivers
ran
nearby
,
and
who
had
built
the
first
hospital
,
and
how
it
had
burned
down
,
and
who
had
built
the
next
hospital
,
until
I
thought
he
must
be
waiting
to
see
when
I
would
interrupt
him
and
tell
him
I
knew
all
that
about
rivers
and
Pilgrims
was
a
lot
of
nonsense
.
But
then
I
thought
some
of
it
might
be
true
,
so
I
tried
to
sort
out
what
was
likely
to
be
true
and
what
was
n't
,
only
before
I
could
do
that
,
he
had
said
good-bye
.
I
waited
till
I
heard
the
voices
of
all
the
doctors
die
away
.
Then
I
threw
back
the
white
blanket
and
put
on
my
shoes
and
walked
out
into
the
hall
.
Nobody
stopped
me
,
so
I
walked
round
the
corner
of
my
wing
of
the
hall
and
down
another
,
longer
hall
,
past
an
open
dining
room
.
A
maid
in
a
green
uniform
was
setting
the
tables
for
supper
.
There
were
white
linen
tablecloths
and
glasses
and
paper
napkins
.
I
stored
the
fact
that
they
were
real
glasses
in
the
corner
of
my
mind
the
way
a
squirrel
stores
a
nut
.
At
the
city
hospital
we
had
drunk
out
of
paper
cups
and
had
no
knives
to
cut
our
meat
.
The
meat
had
always
been
so
overcooked
we
could
cut
it
with
a
fork
.
Finally
I
arrived
at
a
big
lounge
with
shabby
furniture
and
a
threadbare
rug
.
A
girl
with
a
round
pasty
face
and
short
black
hair
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
,
reading
a
magazine
.
She
reminded
me
of
a
Girl
Scout
leader
I
'd
had
once
.
I
glanced
at
her
feet
,
and
sure
enough
,
she
wore
those
flat
brown
leather
shoes
with
fringed
tongues
lapping
down
over
the
front
that
are
supposed
to
be
so
sporty
,
and
the
ends
of
the
laces
were
knobbed
with
little
imitation
acorns
.
The
girl
raised
her
eyes
and
smiled
.
``
I
'm
Valerie
.
Who
are
you
?
''
I
pretended
I
had
n't
heard
and
walked
out
of
the
lounge
to
the
end
of
the
next
wing
.
On
the
way
,
I
passed
a
waist-high
door
behind
which
I
saw
some
nurses
.
``
Where
is
everybody
?
''
``
Out
.
''
The
nurse
was
writing
something
over
and
over
on
little
pieces
of
adhesive
tape
.
I
leaned
across
the
gate
of
the
door
to
see
what
she
was
writing
,
and
it
was
E.
Greenwood
,
E.
Greenwood
,
E.
Greenwood
,
E.
Greenwood
.
``
Out
where
?
''
``
Oh
,
OT
,
the
golf
course
,
playing
badminton
.
''
I
noticed
a
pile
of
clothes
on
a
chair
beside
the
nurse
.
They
were
the
same
clothes
the
nurse
in
the
first
hospital
had
been
packing
into
the
patent
leather
case
when
I
broke
the
mirror
.
The
nurses
began
sticking
the
labels
onto
the
clothes
.
I
walked
back
to
the
lounge
.
I
could
n't
understand
what
these
people
were
doing
,
playing
badminton
and
golf
.
They
must
n't
be
really
sick
at
all
,
to
do
that
.
I
sat
down
near
Valerie
and
observed
her
carefully
.
Yes
,
I
thought
,
she
might
just
as
well
be
in
a
Girl
Scout
camp
.
She
was
reading
her
tatty
copy
of
Vogue
with
intense
interest
.
''What
the
hell
is
she
doing
here
?
''
I
wondered
.
``
There
's
nothing
the
matter
with
her
.
''
``
Do
you
mind
if
I
smoke
?
''
Doctor
Nolan
leaned
back
in
the
armchair
next
to
my
bed
.
I
said
no
,
I
liked
the
smell
of
smoke
.
I
thought
if
Doctor
Nolan
smoked
,
she
might
stay
longer
.
This
was
the
first
time
she
had
come
to
talk
with
me
.
When
she
left
I
would
simply
lapse
into
the
old
blankness
.
``
Tell
me
about
Doctor
Gordon
,
''
Doctor
Nolan
said
suddenly
.
``
Did
you
like
him
?
''
I
gave
Doctor
Nolan
a
wary
look
.
I
thought
the
doctors
must
all
be
in
it
together
,
and
that
somewhere
in
this
hospital
,
in
a
hidden
corner
,
there
reposed
a
machine
exactly
like
Doctor
Gordon
's
,
ready
to
jolt
me
out
of
my
skin
.
``
No
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
did
n't
like
him
at
all
.
''
``
That
's
interesting
.
Why
?
''
``
I
did
n't
like
what
he
did
to
me
.
''
``
Did
to
you
?
''
I
told
Doctor
Nolan
about
the
machine
,
and
the
blue
flashes
,
and
the
jolting
and
the
noise
.
While
I
was
telling
her
she
went
very
still
.
``
That
was
a
mistake
,
''
she
said
then
.
``
It
's
not
supposed
to
be
like
that
.
''
I
stared
at
her
.
``
If
it
's
done
properly
,
''
Doctor
Nolan
said
,
``
it
's
like
going
to
sleep
.
''
``
If
anyone
does
that
to
me
again
I
'll
kill
myself
.
''
Doctor
Nolan
said
firmly
,
``
You
wo
n't
have
any
shock
treatments
here
.
Or
if
you
do
,
''
she
amended
,
``
I
'll
tell
you
about
it
beforehand
,
and
I
promise
you
it
wo
n't
be
anything
like
what
you
had
before
.
Why
,
''
she
finished
,
``
some
people
even
like
them
.
''
After
Doctor
Nolan
had
gone
I
found
a
box
of
matches
on
the
windowsill
.
It
was
n't
an
ordinary-size
box
,
but
an
extremely
tiny
box
.
I
opened
it
and
exposed
a
row
of
little
white
sticks
with
pink
tips
.
I
tried
to
light
one
,
and
it
crumpled
in
my
hand
.
I
could
n't
think
why
Doctor
Nolan
would
have
left
me
such
a
stupid
thing
.
Perhaps
she
wanted
to
see
if
I
would
give
it
back
.
Carefully
I
stored
the
toy
matches
in
the
hem
of
my
new
wool
bathrobe
.
If
Doctor
Nolan
asked
me
for
the
matches
,
I
would
say
I
'd
thought
they
were
made
of
candy
and
had
eaten
them
.
A
new
woman
had
moved
into
the
room
next
to
mine
.
I
thought
she
must
be
the
only
person
in
the
building
who
was
newer
than
I
was
,
so
she
would
n't
know
how
really
bad
I
was
,
the
way
the
rest
did
.
I
thought
I
might
go
in
and
make
friends
.
The
woman
was
lying
on
her
bed
in
a
purple
dress
that
fastened
at
the
neck
with
a
cameo
brooch
and
reached
midway
between
her
knees
and
her
shoes
.
She
had
rusty
hair
knotted
in
a
schoolmarmish
bun
,
and
thin
,
silver-rimmed
spectacles
attached
to
her
breast
pocket
with
a
black
elastic
.
``
Hello
,
''
I
said
conversationally
,
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
.
``
My
name
's
Esther
,
what
's
your
name
?
''
The
woman
did
n't
stir
,
just
stared
up
at
the
ceiling
.
I
felt
hurt
.
I
thought
maybe
Valerie
or
somebody
had
told
her
when
she
first
came
in
how
stupid
I
was
.
A
nurse
popped
her
head
in
at
the
door
.
``
Oh
,
there
you
are
,
''
she
said
to
me
.
``
Visiting
Miss
Norris
.
How
nice
!
''
And
she
disappeared
again
.
I
do
n't
know
how
long
I
sat
there
,
watching
the
woman
in
purple
and
wondering
if
her
pursed
pink
lips
would
open
,
and
if
they
did
open
,
what
they
would
say
.
Finally
,
without
speaking
or
looking
at
me
,
Miss
Norris
swung
her
feet
in
their
high
,
black
,
buttoned
boots
over
the
other
side
of
the
bed
and
walked
out
of
the
room
.
I
thought
she
might
be
trying
to
get
rid
of
me
in
a
subtle
way
.
Quietly
,
at
a
little
distance
,
I
followed
her
down
the
hall
.
Miss
Norris
reached
the
door
of
the
dining
room
and
paused
.
All
the
way
to
the
dining
room
she
had
walked
precisely
,
placing
her
feet
in
the
very
center
of
the
cabbage
roses
that
twined
through
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
.
She
waited
a
moment
and
then
,
one
by
one
,
lifted
her
feet
over
the
doorsill
and
into
the
dining
room
as
though
stepping
over
an
invisible
shin-high
stile
.
She
sat
down
at
one
of
the
round
,
linen-covered
tables
and
unfolded
a
napkin
in
her
lap
.
``
It
's
not
supper
for
an
hour
yet
,
''
the
cook
called
out
of
the
kitchen
.
But
Miss
Norris
did
n't
answer
.
She
just
stared
straight
ahead
of
her
in
a
polite
way
.
I
pulled
up
a
chair
opposite
her
at
the
table
and
unfolded
a
napkin
.
We
did
n't
speak
,
but
sat
there
,
in
a
dose
,
sisterly
silence
,
until
the
gong
for
supper
sounded
down
the
hall
``
Lie
down
,
''
the
nurse
said
.
``
I
'm
going
to
give
you
another
injection
.
''
I
rolled
over
on
my
stomach
on
the
bed
and
hitched
up
my
skirt
.
Then
I
pulled
down
the
trousers
of
my
silk
pajamas
.
``
My
word
,
what
all
have
you
got
under
there
?
''
``
Pajamas
.
So
I
wo
n't
have
to
bother
getting
in
and
out
of
them
all
the
time
.
''
The
nurse
made
a
little
ducking
noise
.
Then
she
said
,
``
Which
side
?
''
It
was
an
old
joke
.
I
raised
my
head
and
glanced
back
at
my
bare
buttocks
.
They
were
bruised
purple
and
green
and
blue
from
past
injections
.
The
left
side
looked
darker
than
the
right
``
The
right
.
''
``
You
name
it
.
''
The
nurse
jabbed
the
needle
in
,
and
I
winced
,
savoring
the
tiny
hurt
.
Three
times
each
day
the
nurses
injected
me
,
and
about
an
hour
after
each
injection
they
gave
me
a
cup
of
sugary
fruit
juice
and
stood
by
,
watching
me
drink
it
.
``
Lucky
you
,
''
Valerie
said
.
``
You
're
on
insulin
.
''
``
Nothing
happens
.
''
``
Oh
,
it
will
.
I
've
had
it
.
Tell
me
when
you
get
a
reaction
.
''
But
I
never
seemed
to
get
any
reaction
.
I
just
grew
fatter
and
fatter
.
Already
I
filled
the
new
,
too-big
clothes
my
mother
had
bought
,
and
when
I
peered
down
at
my
plump
stomach
and
my
broad
hips
I
thought
it
was
a
good
thing
Mrs
.
Guinea
had
n't
seen
me
like
this
,
because
I
looked
just
as
if
I
were
going
to
have
a
baby
.
``
Have
you
seen
my
scars
?
''
Valerie
pushed
aside
her
black
bang
and
indicated
two
pale
marks
,
one
on
either
side
of
her
forehead
,
as
if
at
some
time
she
had
started
to
sprout
horns
,
but
cut
them
off
.
We
were
walking
,
just
the
two
of
us
,
with
the
Sports
Therapist
in
the
asylum
gardens
.
Nowadays
I
was
let
out
on
walk
privileges
more
and
more
often
.
They
never
let
Miss
Norris
out
at
all
.
Valerie
said
Miss
Norris
should
n't
be
in
Caplan
,
but
in
a
building
for
worse
people
called
Wymark
.
``
Do
you
know
what
these
scars
are
?
''
Valerie
persisted
.
``
No
.
What
are
they
?
''
``
I
've
had
a
lobotomy
.
''
I
looked
at
Valerie
in
awe
,
appreciating
for
the
first
time
her
perpetual
marble
calm
.
``
How
do
you
feel
?
''
``
Fine
.
I
'm
not
angry
any
more
.
Before
,
I
was
always
angry
.
I
was
in
Wymark
before
,
and
now
I
'm
in
Caplan
.
I
can
go
to
town
,
now
,
or
shopping
or
to
a
movie
,
along
with
a
nurse
.
''
``
What
will
you
do
when
you
get
out
?
''
``
Oh
,
I
'm
not
leaving
,
''
Valerie
laughed
.
``
I
like
it
here
.
''
``
Moving
day
!
''
``
Why
should
I
be
moving
?
''
The
nurse
went
on
blithely
opening
and
shutting
my
drawers
,
emptying
the
closet
and
folding
my
belongings
into
the
black
overnight
case
.
I
thought
they
must
at
last
be
moving
me
to
Wymark
.
``
Oh
,
you
're
only
moving
to
the
front
of
the
house
,
''
the
nurse
said
cheerfully
.
``
You
'll
like
it
.
There
's
lots
more
sun
.
''
When
we
came
out
into
the
hall
,
I
saw
that
Miss
Norris
was
moving
too
.
A
nurse
,
young
and
cheerful
as
my
own
,
stood
in
the
doorway
of
Miss
Norris
's
room
,
helping
Miss
Norris
into
a
purple
coat
with
a
scrawny
squirrel-fur
collar
.
Hour
after
hour
I
had
been
keeping
watch
by
Miss
Norris
's
bedside
,
refusing
the
diversion
of
OT
and
walks
and
badminton
matches
and
even
the
weekly
movies
,
which
I
enjoyed
,
and
which
Miss
Norris
never
went
to
,
simply
to
brood
over
the
pale
,
speechless
circlet
of
her
lips
.
I
thought
how
exciting
it
would
be
if
she
opened
her
mouth
and
spoke
,
and
I
rushed
out
into
the
hall
and
announced
this
to
the
nurses
.
They
would
praise
me
for
encouraging
Miss
Norris
,
and
I
would
probably
be
allowed
shopping
privileges
and
movie
privileges
downtown
,
and
my
escape
would
be
assured
.
But
in
all
my
hours
of
vigil
Miss
Norris
had
n't
said
a
word
.
``
Where
are
you
moving
to
?
''
I
asked
her
now
.
The
nurse
touched
Miss
Norris
's
elbow
,
and
Miss
Norris
jerked
into
motion
like
a
doll
on
wheels
.
``
She
's
going
to
Wymark
,
''
my
nurse
told
me
in
a
low
voice
.
``
I
'm
afraid
Miss
Norris
is
n't
moving
up
like
you
.
''
I
watched
Miss
Norris
lift
one
foot
,
and
then
the
other
,
over
the
invisible
stile
that
barred
the
front
doorsill
.
``
I
've
a
surprise
for
you
,
''
the
nurse
said
as
she
installed
me
in
a
sunny
room
in
the
front
wing
overlooking
the
green
golf
links
.
``
Somebody
you
know
's
just
come
today
.
''
``
Somebody
I
know
?
''
The
nurse
laughed
.
``
Do
n't
look
at
me
like
that
.
It
's
not
a
policeman
.
''
Then
,
as
I
did
n't
say
anything
,
she
added
,
``
She
says
she
's
an
old
friend
of
yours
.
She
lives
next
door
.
Why
do
n't
you
pay
her
a
visit
?
''
I
thought
the
nurse
must
be
joking
,
and
that
if
I
knocked
on
the
door
next
to
mine
I
would
hear
no
answer
,
but
go
in
and
find
Miss
Norris
,
buttoned
into
her
purple
,
squirrel-collared
coat
and
lying
on
the
bed
,
her
mouth
blooming
out
of
the
quiet
vase
of
her
body
like
the
bud
of
a
rose
.
Still
,
I
went
out
and
knocked
on
the
neighboring
door
.
``
Come
in
!
''
called
a
gay
voice
.
I
opened
the
door
a
crack
and
peered
into
the
room
.
The
big
,
horsey
girl
in
jodhpurs
sitting
by
the
window
glanced
up
with
a
broad
smile
.
``
Esther
!
''
She
sounded
out
of
breath
,
as
if
she
had
been
running
a
long
,
long
distance
and
only
just
come
to
a
halt
.
``
How
nice
to
see
you
.
They
told
me
you
were
here
.
''
``
Joan
?
''
I
said
tentatively
,
then
``
Joan
!
''
in
confusion
and
disbelief
.
Joan
beamed
,
revealing
her
large
,
gleaming
,
unmistakable
teeth
.
``
It
's
really
me
.
I
thought
you
'd
be
surprised
.
''
Sixteen
Joan
's
room
,
with
its
closet
and
bureau
and
table
and
chair
and
white
blanket
with
the
big
blue
C
on
it
,
was
a
mirror
image
of
my
own
.
It
occurred
to
me
that
Joan
,
hearing
where
I
was
,
had
engaged
a
room
at
the
asylum
on
pretense
,
simply
as
a
joke
.
That
would
explain
why
she
had
told
the
nurse
I
was
her
friend
.
I
had
never
known
Joan
,
except
at
a
cool
distance
.
``
How
did
you
get
here
?
''
I
curled
up
on
Joan
's
bed
.
``
I
read
about
you
,
''
Joan
said
.
``
What
?
''
``
I
read
about
you
,
and
I
ran
away
,
''
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
I
said
evenly
.
``
Well
,
''
Joan
leaned
back
in
the
chintz-flowered
asylum
armchair
,
``
I
had
a
summer
job
working
for
the
chapter
head
of
some
fraternity
,
like
the
Masons
,
you
know
,
but
not
the
Masons
,
and
I
felt
terrible
.
I
had
these
bunions
,
I
could
hardly
walk
--
in
the
last
days
I
had
to
wear
rubber
boots
to
work
,
instead
of
shoes
,
and
you
can
imagine
what
that
did
to
my
morale
.
.
.
''
I
thought
either
Joan
must
be
crazy
--
wearing
rubber
boots
to
work
--
or
she
must
be
trying
to
see
how
crazy
I
was
,
believing
all
that
.
Besides
,
only
old
people
ever
got
bunions
.
I
decided
to
pretend
I
thought
she
was
crazy
,
and
that
I
was
only
humoring
her
along
.
``
I
always
feel
lousy
without
shoes
,
''
I
said
with
an
ambiguous
smile
.
``
Did
your
feet
hurt
much
?
''
``
Terribly
.
And
my
boss
--
he
'd
just
separated
from
his
wife
,
he
could
n't
come
right
out
and
get
a
divorce
,
because
that
would
n't
go
with
this
fraternal
order
--
my
boss
kept
buzzing
me
in
every
other
minute
,
and
each
time
I
moved
my
feet
hurt
like
the
devil
,
but
the
second
I
'd
sit
down
at
my
desk
again
,
buzz
went
the
buzzer
,
and
he
'd
have
something
else
he
wanted
to
get
off
his
chest
.
.
.
''
``
Why
did
n't
you
quit
?
''
``
Oh
,
I
did
quit
,
more
or
less
.
I
stayed
off
work
on
sick
leave
.
I
did
n't
go
out
.
I
did
n't
see
anyone
.
I
stowed
the
telephone
in
a
drawer
and
never
answered
it
...
``
Then
my
doctor
sent
me
to
a
psychiatrist
at
this
big
hospital
I
had
an
appointment
for
twelve
o'clock
,
and
I
was
in
an
awful
state
.
Finally
,
at
half
past
twelve
,
the
receptionist
came
out
and
told
me
the
doctor
had
gone
to
lunch
.
She
asked
me
if
I
wanted
to
wait
,
and
I
said
yes
.
''
``
Did
he
come
back
?
''
The
story
sounded
rather
involved
for
Joan
to
have
made
up
out
of
whole
cloth
,
but
I
led
her
on
,
to
see
what
would
come
of
it
.
``
Oh
yes
.
I
was
going
to
kill
myself
,
mind
you
.
I
said
'If
this
doctor
does
n't
do
the
trick
,
that
's
the
end
.
'
Well
,
the
receptionist
led
me
down
a
long
hall
,
and
just
as
we
got
to
the
door
she
turned
to
me
and
said
,
'You
wo
n't
mind
if
there
are
a
few
students
with
the
doctor
,
will
you
?
'
What
could
I
say
?
'Oh
no
,
'
I
said
.
I
walked
in
and
found
nine
pairs
of
eyes
fixed
on
me
.
Nine
!
Eighteen
separate
eyes
.
``
Now
,
if
that
receptionist
had
told
me
there
were
going
to
be
nine
people
in
that
room
,
I
'd
have
walked
out
on
the
spot
.
But
there
I
was
,
and
it
was
too
late
to
do
a
thing
about
it
.
Well
,
on
this
particular
day
I
happened
to
be
wearing
a
fur
coat
.
.
.
''
``
In
August
?
''
``
Oh
,
it
was
one
of
those
cold
,
wet
days
,
and
I
thought
,
my
first
psychiatrist
--
you
know
.
Anyway
,
this
psychiatrist
kept
eyeing
that
fur
coat
the
whole
time
I
talked
to
him
,
and
I
could
just
see
what
he
thought
of
my
asking
to
pay
the
student
's
cut
rate
instead
of
the
full
fee
.
I
could
see
the
dollar
signs
in
his
eyes
.
Well
,
I
told
him
I
do
n't
know
whatall
-
-
about
the
bunions
and
the
telephone
in
the
drawer
and
how
I
wanted
to
kill
myself
--
and
then
he
asked
me
to
wait
outside
while
he
discussed
my
case
with
the
others
,
and
when
he
called
me
back
in
,
you
know
what
he
said
?
''
``
What
?
''
``
He
folded
his
hands
together
and
looked
at
me
and
said
,
'Miss
Gilling
,
we
have
decided
that
you
would
benefit
by
group
therapy
.
'
``
``
Group
therapy
?
''
I
thought
I
must
sound
phony
as
an
echo
chamber
,
but
Joan
did
n't
pay
any
notice
.
``
That
's
what
he
said
.
Can
you
imagine
me
wanting
to
kill
myself
,
and
coming
round
to
chat
about
it
with
a
whole
pack
of
strangers
,
and
most
of
them
no
better
than
myself
.
.
.
''
``
That
's
crazy
.
''
I
was
growing
involved
in
spite
of
myself
.
``
That
's
not
even
human
.
''
``
That
's
just
what
I
said
.
I
went
straight
home
and
wrote
that
doctor
a
letter
.
I
wrote
him
one
beautiful
letter
about
how
a
man
like
that
had
no
business
setting
himself
up
to
help
sick
people
.
.
.
''
``
Did
you
get
any
answer
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
.
That
was
the
day
I
read
about
you
.
''
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
``
Oh
,
''
Joan
said
,
``
about
how
the
police
thought
you
were
dead
and
all
.
I
've
got
a
pile
of
clippings
somewhere
.
''
She
heaved
herself
up
,
and
I
had
a
strong
horsey
whiff
that
made
my
nostrils
prickle
.
Joan
had
been
a
champion
horse-jumper
at
the
annual
college
gymkhana
,
and
I
wondered
if
she
had
been
sleeping
in
a
stable
.
Joan
rummaged
in
her
open
suitcase
and
came
up
with
a
fistful
of
clippings
.
``
Here
,
have
a
look
.
''
The
first
clipping
showed
a
big
,
blown-up
picture
of
a
girl
with
black-shadowed
eyes
and
black
lips
spread
in
a
grin
.
I
could
n't
imagine
where
such
a
tarty
picture
had
been
taken
until
I
noticed
the
Bloomingdale
earrings
and
the
Bloomingdale
necklace
glinting
out
of
it
with
bright
,
white
highlights
,
like
imitation
stars
.
SCHOLARSHIP
GIRL
MISSING
.
MOTHER
WORRIED
The
article
under
the
picture
told
how
this
girl
had
disappeared
from
her
home
on
August
17th
,
wearing
a
green
skirt
and
a
white
blouse
,
and
had
left
a
note
saying
she
was
taking
a
long
walk
.
When
Miss
Greenwood
had
not
returned
by
midnight
,
it
said
,
her
mother
called
the
town
police
.
The
next
clipping
showed
a
picture
of
my
mother
and
brother
and
me
grouped
together
in
our
backyard
and
smiling
.
I
could
n't
think
who
had
taken
that
picture
either
,
until
I
saw
I
was
wearing
dungarees
and
white
sneakers
and
remembered
that
was
what
I
wore
in
my
spinach-picking
summer
,
and
how
Dodo
Conway
had
dropped
by
and
taken
some
family
snaps
of
the
three
of
us
one
hot
afternoon
.
Mrs.
Greenwood
asked
that
this
picture
be
printed
in
hopes
that
it
will
encourage
her
daughter
to
return
home
.
SLEEPING
PILLS
FEARED
MISSING
WITH
GIRL
A
dark
,
midnight
picture
of
about
a
dozen
moon-faced
people
in
a
wood
.
I
thought
the
people
at
the
end
of
the
row
looked
queer
and
unusually
short
until
I
realized
they
were
not
people
,
but
dogs
.
Bloodhounds
used
in
search
for
missing
girl
.
Police
Sgt
.
Bill
Mindly
says
:
It
does
n't
look
good
.
GIRL
FOUND
ALIVE
!
The
last
picture
showed
policemen
lifting
a
long
,
limp
blanket
roll
with
a
featureless
cabbage
head
into
the
back
of
an
ambulance
.
Then
it
told
how
my
mother
had
been
down
in
the
cellar
,
doing
the
week
's
laundry
,
when
she
heard
faint
groans
coming
from
a
disused
hole
.
.
.
I
laid
the
clippings
on
the
white
spread
of
the
bed
.
``
You
keep
them
,
''
Joan
said
.
``
You
ought
to
stick
them
in
a
scrapbook
.
''
I
folded
the
clippings
and
slipped
them
in
my
pocket
.
``
I
read
about
you
,
''
Joan
went
on
.
``
Not
how
they
found
you
,
but
everything
up
to
that
,
and
I
put
all
my
money
together
and
took
the
first
plane
to
New
York
.
''
``
Why
New
York
?
''
``
Oh
,
I
thought
it
would
be
easier
to
kill
myself
in
New
York
.
''
``
What
did
you
do
?
''
Joan
grinned
sheepishly
and
stretched
out
her
hands
,
palm
up
.
Like
a
miniature
mountain
range
,
large
reddish
weals
upheaved
across
the
white
flesh
of
her
wrists
.
``
How
did
you
do
that
?
''
For
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
me
Joan
and
I
might
have
something
in
common
.
``
I
shoved
my
fists
through
my
roommate
's
window
.
''
``
What
roommate
?
''
``
My
old
college
roommate
.
She
was
working
in
New
York
,
and
I
could
n't
think
of
anyplace
else
to
stay
,
and
besides
,
I
'd
hardly
any
money
left
,
so
I
went
to
stay
with
her
.
My
parents
found
me
there
--
she
'd
written
them
I
was
acting
funny
--
and
my
father
flew
straight
down
and
brought
me
back
.
''
``
But
you
're
all
right
now
.
''
I
made
it
a
statement
.
Joan
considered
me
with
her
bright
,
pebble-gray
eyes
.
``
I
guess
so
,
''
she
said
.
``
Are
n't
you
?
''
I
had
fallen
asleep
after
the
evening
meal
.
I
was
awakened
by
a
loud
voice
.
Mrs.
Bannister
,
Mrs.
Bannister
,
Mrs.
Bannister
,
Mrs.
Bannister
.
As
I
pulled
out
of
sleep
,
I
found
I
was
beating
on
the
bedpost
with
my
hands
and
calling
.
The
sharp
,
wry
figure
of
Mrs.
Bannister
,
the
night
nurse
,
scurried
into
view
.
``
Here
,
we
do
n't
want
you
to
break
this
.
''
She
unfastened
the
band
of
my
watch
.
``
What
's
the
matter
?
What
happened
?
''
Mrs.
Bannister
's
face
twisted
into
a
quick
smile
.
``
You
've
had
a
reaction
.
''
``
A
reaction
?
''
``
Yes
,
how
do
you
feel
?
''
``
Funny
.
Sort
of
light
and
airy
.
''
Mrs.
Bannister
helped
me
sit
up
.
``
You
'll
be
better
now
.
You
'll
be
better
in
no
time
.
Would
you
like
some
hot
milk
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
And
when
Mrs.
Bannister
held
the
cup
to
my
lips
,
I
fanned
the
hot
milk
out
on
my
tongue
as
it
went
down
,
tasting
it
luxuriously
,
the
way
a
baby
tastes
its
mother
.
``
Mrs.
Bannister
tells
me
you
had
a
reaction
.
''
Doctor
Nolan
seated
herself
in
the
armchair
by
the
window
and
took
out
a
tiny
box
of
matches
.
The
box
looked
exactly
like
the
one
I
had
hidden
in
the
hem
of
my
bathrobe
,
and
for
a
moment
I
wondered
if
a
nurse
had
discovered
it
there
and
given
it
back
to
Doctor
Nolan
on
the
quiet
.
Doctor
Nolan
scraped
a
match
on
the
side
of
the
box
.
A
hot
yellow
flame
jumped
into
life
,
and
I
watched
her
suck
it
up
into
the
cigarette
.
``
Mrs.
B.
says
you
felt
better
.
''
``
I
did
for
a
while
.
Now
I
'm
the
same
again
.
''
``
I
've
news
for
you
.
''
I
waited
.
Every
day
now
,
for
I
did
n't
know
how
many
days
,
I
had
spent
the
mornings
and
afternoons
and
evenings
wrapped
up
in
my
white
blanket
on
the
deck
chair
in
the
alcove
,
pretending
to
read
.
I
had
a
dim
notion
that
Doctor
Nolan
was
allowing
me
a
certain
number
of
days
and
then
she
would
say
just
what
Doctor
Gordon
had
said
:
``
I
'm
sorry
,
you
do
n't
seem
to
have
improved
,
I
think
you
'd
better
have
some
shock
treatment
.
.
.
''
``
Well
,
do
n't
you
want
to
hear
what
it
is
?
''
``
What
?
''
I
said
dully
,
and
braced
myself
.
``
You
're
not
to
have
any
more
visitors
for
a
while
.
''
I
stared
at
Doctor
Nolan
in
surprise
.
``
Why
that
's
wonderful
.
''
``
I
thought
you
'd
be
pleased
.
''
She
smiled
.
Then
I
looked
,
and
Doctor
Nolan
looked
,
at
the
wastebasket
beside
my
bureau
.
Out
of
the
wastebasket
poked
the
blood-red
buds
of
a
dozen
long-stemmed
roses
.
That
afternoon
my
mother
had
come
to
visit
me
.
My
mother
was
only
one
in
a
long
stream
of
visitors
--
my
former
employer
,
the
lady
Christian
Scientist
,
who
walked
on
the
lawn
with
me
and
talked
about
the
mist
going
up
from
the
earth
in
the
Bible
,
and
the
mist
being
error
,
and
my
whole
trouble
being
that
I
believed
in
the
mist
,
and
the
minute
I
stopped
believing
in
it
,
it
would
disappear
and
I
would
see
I
had
always
been
well
,
and
the
English
teacher
I
had
in
high
school
who
came
and
tried
to
teach
me
how
to
play
Scrabble
,
because
he
thought
it
might
revive
my
old
interest
in
words
,
and
Philomena
Guinea
herself
,
who
was
n't
at
all
satisfied
with
what
the
doctors
were
doing
and
kept
telling
them
so
.
I
hated
these
visits
.
I
would
be
sitting
in
my
alcove
or
in
my
room
,
and
a
smiling
nurse
would
pop
in
and
announce
one
or
another
of
the
visitors
.
Once
they
'd
even
brought
the
minister
of
thef
Unitarian
church
,
whom
I
'd
never
really
liked
at
all
.
He
was
terribly
nervous
the
whole
time
,
and
I
could
tell
he
thought
I
was
crazy
as
a
loon
,
because
I
told
him
I
believed
in
hell
,
and
that
certain
people
,
like
me
,
had
to
live
in
hell
before
they
died
,
to
make
up
for
missing
out
on
it
after
death
,
since
they
did
n't
believe
in
life
after
death
,
and
what
each
person
believed
happened
to
him
when
he
died
.
I
hated
these
visits
,
because
I
kept
feeling
the
visitors
measuring
my
fat
and
stringy
hair
against
what
I
had
been
and
what
they
wanted
me
to
be
,
and
I
knew
they
went
away
utterly
confounded
.
I
thought
if
they
left
me
alone
I
might
have
some
peace
.
My
mother
was
the
worst
.
She
never
scolded
me
,
but
kept
begging
me
,
with
a
sorrowful
face
,
to
tell
her
what
she
had
done
wrong
.
She
said
she
was
sure
the
doctors
thought
she
had
done
something
wrong
because
they
asked
her
a
lot
of
questions
about
my
toilet
training
,
and
I
had
been
perfectly
trained
at
a
very
early
age
and
given
her
no
trouble
whatsoever
.
That
afternoon
my
mother
had
brought
me
the
roses
.
``
Save
them
for
my
funeral
,
''
I
'd
said
.
My
mother
's
face
puckered
,
and
she
looked
ready
to
cry
.
``
But
Esther
,
do
n't
you
remember
what
day
it
is
today
?
''
``
No
.
''
I
thought
it
might
be
Saint
Valentine
's
day
.
``
It
's
your
birthday
.
''
And
that
was
when
I
had
dumped
the
roses
in
the
waste-basket
.
``
That
was
a
silly
thing
for
her
to
do
,
''
I
said
to
Doctor
Nolan
.
Doctor
Nolan
nodded
.
She
seemed
to
know
what
I
meant
.
``
I
hate
her
,
''
I
said
,
and
waited
for
the
blow
to
fall
.
But
Doctor
Nolan
only
smiled
at
me
as
if
something
had
pleased
her
very
,
very
much
,
and
said
,
``
I
suppose
you
do
.
''
Seventeen
``
You
're
a
lucky
girl
today
.
''
The
young
nurse
cleared
my
breakfast
tray
away
and
left
me
wrapped
in
my
white
blanket
like
a
passenger
taking
the
sea
air
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
.
``
Why
am
I
lucky
?
''
``
Well
,
I
'm
not
sure
if
you
're
supposed
to
know
yet
,
but
today
,
you
're
moving
to
Belsize
.
''
The
nurse
looked
at
me
expectantly
.
``
Belsize
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
ca
n't
go
there
.
''
``
Why
not
?
''
``
I
'm
not
ready
.
I
'm
not
well
enough
.
''
``
Of
course
,
you
're
well
enough
.
Do
n't
worry
,
they
would
n't
be
moving
you
if
you
were
n't
well
enough
.
''
After
the
nurse
left
,
I
tried
to
puzzle
out
this
new
move
on
Doctor
Nolan
's
part
.
What
was
she
trying
to
prove
?
I
had
n't
changed
.
Nothing
had
changed
.
And
Belsize
was
the
best
house
of
all
.
From
Belsize
people
went
back
to
work
and
back
to
school
and
back
to
their
homes
.
Joan
would
be
at
Belsize
.
Joan
with
her
physics
books
and
her
golf
clubs
and
her
badminton
rackets
and
her
breathy
voice
.
Joan
,
marking
the
gulf
between
me
and
the
nearly
well
ones
.
Ever
since
Joan
left
Caplan
I
'd
followed
her
progress
through
the
asylum
grapevine
.
Joan
had
walk
privileges
,
Joan
had
shopping
privileges
,
Joan
had
town
privileges
.
I
gathered
all
my
news
of
Joan
into
a
little
,
bitter
heap
,
though
I
received
it
with
surface
gladness
.
Joan
was
the
beaming
double
of
my
old
best
self
,
specially
designed
to
follow
and
torment
me
.
Perhaps
Joan
would
be
gone
when
I
got
to
Belsize
.
At
least
at
Belsize
I
could
forget
about
shock
treatments
.
At
Caplan
a
lot
of
the
women
had
shock
treatments
.
I
could
tell
which
ones
they
were
,
because
they
did
n't
get
their
breakfast
trays
with
the
rest
of
us
.
They
had
their
shock
treatments
while
we
breakfasted
in
our
rooms
,
and
then
they
came
into
the
lounge
,
quiet
and
extinguished
,
led
like
children
by
the
nurses
,
and
ate
their
breakfasts
there
.
Each
morning
,
when
I
heard
the
nurse
knock
with
my
tray
,
an
immense
relief
flooded
through
me
,
because
I
knew
I
was
out
of
danger
for
that
day
.
I
did
n't
see
how
Doctor
Nolan
could
tell
you
went
to
sleep
during
a
shock
treatment
if
she
'd
never
had
a
shock
treatment
herself
.
How
did
she
know
the
person
did
n't
just
look
as
if
he
was
asleep
,
while
all
the
time
,
inside
,
he
was
feeling
the
blue
volts
and
the
noise
?
Piano
music
sounded
from
the
end
of
the
hall
.
At
supper
I
sat
quietly
,
listening
to
the
chatter
of
the
Belsize
women
.
They
were
all
fashionably
dressed
and
carefully
made
up
,
and
several
of
them
were
married
.
Some
of
them
had
been
shopping
downtown
,
and
others
had
been
out
visiting
friends
,
and
all
during
supper
they
kept
tossing
back
and
forth
these
private
jokes
.
``
I
'd
call
Jack
,
''
a
woman
named
DeeDee
said
,
``
only
I
'm
afraid
he
would
n't
be
home
.
I
know
just
where
I
could
call
him
,
though
,
and
he
'd
be
in
,
all
right
.
''
The
short
,
spry
blonde
woman
at
my
table
laughed
.
``
I
almost
had
Doctor
Loring
where
I
wanted
him
today
.
''
She
widened
her
starey
blue
eyes
like
a
little
doll
.
``
I
would
n't
mind
trading
old
Percy
in
for
a
new
model
.
''
At
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
,
Joan
was
wolfing
her
Spam
and
broiled
tomato
with
great
appetite
.
She
seemed
perfectly
at
home
among
these
women
and
treated
me
coolly
,
with
a
slight
sneer
,
like
a
dim
and
inferior
acquaintance
.
I
had
gone
to
bed
right
after
supper
,
but
then
I
heard
the
piano
music
and
pictured
Joan
and
DeeDee
and
Loubelle
,
the
blonde
woman
,
and
the
rest
of
them
,
laughing
and
gossiping
about
me
in
the
living
room
behind
my
back
.
They
would
be
saying
how
awful
it
was
to
have
people
like
me
in
Belsize
and
that
I
should
be
in
Wymark
instead
.
I
decided
to
put
a
lid
on
their
nasty
talk
.
Draping
my
blanket
loosely
around
my
shoulders
,
like
a
stole
,
I
wandered
down
the
hall
toward
the
light
and
the
gay
noise
.
For
the
rest
of
the
evening
I
listened
to
DeeDee
thump
out
some
of
her
own
songs
on
the
grand
piano
,
while
the
other
women
sat
round
playing
bridge
and
chatting
,
just
the
way
they
would
in
a
college
dormitory
,
only
most
of
them
were
ten
years
over
college
age
.
One
of
them
,
a
great
,
tall
,
gray-haired
woman
with
a
booming
bass
voice
,
named
Mrs.
Savage
,
had
gone
to
Vassar
.
I
could
tell
right
away
she
was
a
society
woman
,
because
she
talked
about
nothing
but
debutantes
.
It
seemed
she
had
two
or
three
daughters
,
and
that
year
they
were
all
going
to
be
debutantes
,
only
she
had
loused
up
their
debutante
party
by
signing
herself
into
the
asylum
.
DeeDee
had
one
song
she
called
``
The
Milkman
''
and
everybody
kept
saying
she
ought
to
get
it
published
,
it
would
be
a
hit
.
First
her
hands
would
clop
out
a
little
melody
on
the
keys
,
like
the
hoofbeats
of
a
slow
pony
,
and
next
another
melody
came
in
,
like
the
milkman
whistling
,
and
then
the
two
melodies
went
on
together
.
``
That
's
very
nice
,
''
I
said
in
a
conversational
voice
.
Joan
was
leaning
on
one
corner
of
the
piano
and
leafing
through
a
new
issue
of
some
fashion
magazine
,
and
DeeDee
smiled
up
at
her
as
if
the
two
of
them
shared
a
secret
.
``
Oh
,
Esther
,
''
Joan
said
then
,
holding
up
the
magazine
,
``
is
n't
this
you
?
''
DeeDee
stopped
playing
.
``
Let
me
see
.
''
She
took
the
magazine
,
peered
at
the
page
Joan
pointed
to
,
and
then
glanced
back
at
me
.
``
Oh
no
,
''
DeeDee
said
.
``
Surely
not
.
''
She
looked
at
the
magazine
again
,
then
at
me
.
``
Never
!
''
``
Oh
,
but
it
is
Esther
,
is
n't
it
,
Esther
?
''
Joan
said
.
Loubelle
and
Mrs.
Savage
drifted
over
,
and
pretending
I
knew
what
it
was
all
about
,
I
moved
to
the
piano
with
them
.
The
magazine
photograph
showed
a
girl
in
a
strapless
evening
dress
of
fuzzy
white
stuff
,
grinning
fit
to
split
,
with
a
whole
lot
of
boys
bending
around
her
.
The
girl
was
holding
a
glass
full
of
a
transparent
drink
and
seemed
to
have
her
eyes
fixed
over
my
shoulder
on
something
that
stood
behind
me
,
a
little
to
my
left
.
A
faint
breath
fanned
the
back
of
my
neck
.
I
wheeled
round
.
The
night
nurse
had
come
in
,
unnoticed
,
on
her
soft
rubber
soles
.
``
No
kidding
,
''
she
said
,
``
is
that
really
you
?
''
``
No
,
it
's
not
me
.
Joan
's
quite
mistaken
.
It
's
somebody
else
.
''
``
Oh
,
say
it
's
you
!
''
DeeDee
cried
.
But
I
pretended
I
did
n't
hear
her
and
turned
away
.
Then
Loubelle
begged
the
nurse
to
make
a
fourth
at
bridge
,
and
I
drew
up
a
chair
to
watch
,
although
I
did
n't
know
the
first
thing
about
bridge
,
because
I
had
n't
had
time
to
pick
it
up
at
college
,
the
way
all
the
wealthy
girls
did
.
I
stared
at
the
flat
poker
faces
of
the
kings
and
jacks
and
queens
and
listened
to
the
nurse
talking
about
her
hard
life
.
``
You
ladies
do
n't
know
what
it
is
,
holding
down
two
jobs
,
''
she
said
.
``
Nights
I
'm
over
here
,
watching
you
.
.
.
''
Loubelle
giggled
.
``
Oh
,
we
're
good
.
We
're
the
best
of
the
lot
,
and
you
know
it
.
''
``
Oh
,
you
're
all
right
''
The
nurse
passed
round
a
packet
of
spearmint
gum
,
then
unfolded
a
pink
strap
from
its
tinfoil
wrapper
herself
.
``
You
're
all
right
,
it
's
those
boobies
at
the
state
place
that
worry
me
off
my
feet
.
''
``
Do
you
work
in
both
places
then
?
''
I
asked
with
sudden
interest
.
``
You
bet
.
''
The
nurse
gave
me
a
straight
look
,
and
I
could
see
she
thought
I
had
no
business
in
Belsize
at
all
.
``
You
would
n't
like
it
over
there
one
bit
,
Lady
Jane
.
''
I
found
it
strange
that
the
nurse
should
call
me
Lady
Jane
when
she
knew
what
my
name
was
perfectly
well
.
``
Why
?
''
I
persisted
.
``
Oh
,
it
's
not
a
nice
place
,
like
this
.
This
is
a
regular
country
club
.
Over
there
they
've
got
nothing
.
No
OT
to
talk
of
,
no
walks
.
.
.
''
``
Why
have
n't
they
got
walks
?
''
``
Not
enough
em-ploy-ees
.
''
The
nurse
scooped
in
a
trick
and
Loubelle
groaned
.
``
Believe
me
,
ladies
,
when
I
collect
enough
do-re-mi
to
buy
me
a
car
,
I
'm
clearing
out
.
''
``
Will
you
clear
out
of
here
,
too
?
''
Joan
wanted
to
know
.
``
You
bet
.
Only
private
cases
from
then
on
.
When
I
feel
like
it
.
.
.
''
But
I
'd
stopped
listening
.
I
felt
the
nurse
had
been
instructed
to
show
me
my
alternatives
.
Either
I
got
better
,
or
I
fell
,
down
,
down
,
like
a
burning
,
then
burnt-out
star
,
from
Belsize
,
to
Caplan
,
to
Wymark
and
finally
,
after
Doctor
Nolan
and
Mrs
.
Guinea
had
given
me
up
,
to
the
state
place
next
door
.
I
gathered
my
blanket
round
me
and
pushed
back
my
chair
.
``
You
cold
?
''
the
nurse
demanded
rudely
.
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
,
moving
off
down
the
hall
.
``
I
'm
frozen
stiff
.
''
I
woke
warm
and
placid
in
my
white
cocoon
.
A
shaft
of
pale
,
wintry
sunlight
dazzled
the
mirror
and
the
glasses
on
the
bureau
and
the
metal
doorknobs
.
From
across
the
hall
came
the
early-morning
clatter
of
the
maids
in
the
kitchen
,
preparing
the
breakfast
trays
.
I
heard
the
nurse
knock
on
the
door
next
to
mine
,
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
.
Mrs.
Savage
's
sleepy
voice
boomed
out
,
and
the
nurse
went
in
to
her
with
the
jingling
tray
.
I
thought
,
with
a
mild
stir
of
pleasure
,
of
the
steaming
blue
china
coffee
pitcher
and
the
blue
china
breakfast
cup
and
the
fat
blue
china
cream
jug
with
the
white
daisies
on
it
I
was
beginning
to
resign
myself
.
If
I
was
going
to
fall
,
I
would
hang
on
to
my
small
comforts
,
at
least
,
as
long
as
I
possibly
could
.
The
nurse
rapped
on
my
door
and
,
without
waiting
for
an
answer
,
breezed
in
.
It
was
a
new
nurse
--
they
were
always
changing
--
with
a
lean
,
sand-colored
face
and
sandy
hair
,
and
large
freckles
polka-dotting
her
bony
nose
.
For
some
reason
the
sight
of
this
nurse
made
me
sick
at
heart
,
and
it
was
only
as
she
strode
across
the
room
to
snap
up
the
green
blind
that
I
realized
part
of
her
strangeness
came
from
being
empty-handed
.
I
opened
my
mouth
to
ask
for
my
breakfast
tray
,
but
silenced
myself
immediately
.
The
nurse
would
be
mistaking
me
for
somebody
else
.
New
nurses
often
did
that
.
Somebody
in
Belsize
must
be
having
shock
treatments
,
unknown
to
me
,
and
the
nurse
had
,
quite
understandably
,
confused
me
with
her
.
I
waited
until
the
nurse
had
made
her
little
circuit
of
my
room
,
patting
,
straightening
,
arranging
,
and
taken
the
next
tray
in
to
Loubelle
one
door
farther
down
the
hall
.
Then
I
shoved
my
feet
into
my
slippers
,
dragging
my
blanket
with
me
,
for
the
morning
was
bright
,
but
very
cold
,
and
crossed
quickly
to
the
kitchen
.
The
pink-
uniformed
maid
was
filling
a
row
of
blue
china
coffee
pitchers
from
a
great
,
battered
kettle
on
the
stove
.
I
looked
with
love
at
the
lineup
of
waiting
trays
--
the
white
paper
napkins
,
folded
in
their
crisp
,
isosceles
triangles
,
each
under
the
anchor
of
its
silver
fork
,
the
pale
domes
of
soft-boiled
eggs
in
the
blue
egg
cups
,
the
scalloped
glass
shells
of
orange
marmalade
.
All
I
had
to
do
was
reach
out
and
claim
my
tray
,
and
the
world
would
be
perfectly
normal
.
``
There
's
been
a
mistake
,
''
I
told
the
maid
,
leaning
over
the
counter
and
speaking
in
a
low
,
confidential
tone
.
``
The
new
nurse
forgot
to
bring
me
in
my
breakfast
tray
today
.
''
I
managed
a
bright
smile
,
to
show
there
were
no
hard
feelings
.
``
What
's
the
name
?
''
``
Greenwood
.
Esther
Greenwood
.
''
``
Greenwood
,
Greenwood
,
Greenwood
.
''
The
maid
's
warty
index
finger
slid
down
the
list
of
names
of
the
patients
in
Belsize
tacked
upon
the
kitchen
wall
``
Greenwood
,
no
breakfast
today
.
''
I
caught
the
rim
of
the
counter
with
both
hands
.
``
There
must
be
a
mistake
.
Are
you
sure
it
's
Greenwood
?
''
``
Greenwood
,
''
the
maid
said
decisively
as
the
nurse
came
in
.
The
nurse
looked
questioningly
from
me
to
the
maid
.
``
Miss
Greenwood
wanted
her
tray
,
''
the
maid
said
,
avoiding
my
eyes
.
``
Oh
,
''
the
nurse
smiled
at
me
,
``
you
'll
be
getting
your
tray
later
on
this
morning
,
Miss
Greenwood
.
You
.
.
.
''
But
I
did
n't
wait
to
hear
what
the
nurse
said
.
I
strode
blindly
out
into
the
hall
,
not
to
my
room
,
because
that
was
where
they
would
come
to
get
me
,
but
to
the
alcove
,
greatly
inferior
to
the
alcove
at
Caplan
,
but
an
alcove
,
nevertheless
,
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
hall
,
where
Joan
and
Loubelle
and
DeeDee
and
Mrs.
Savage
would
not
come
.
I
curled
up
in
the
far
corner
of
the
alcove
with
the
blanket
over
my
head
.
It
was
n't
the
shock
treatment
that
struck
me
,
so
much
as
the
bare-faced
treachery
of
Doctor
Nolan
.
I
liked
Doctor
Nolan
,
I
loved
her
,
I
had
given
her
my
trust
on
a
platter
and
told
her
everything
,
and
she
had
promised
,
faithfully
,
to
warn
me
ahead
of
time
if
ever
I
had
to
have
another
shock
treatment
.
If
she
had
told
me
the
night
before
I
would
have
lain
awake
all
night
,
of
course
,
full
of
dread
and
foreboding
,
but
by
morning
I
would
have
been
composed
and
ready
.
I
would
have
gone
down
the
hall
between
two
nurses
,
past
DeeDee
and
Loubelle
and
Mrs.
Savage
and
Joan
,
with
dignity
,
like
a
person
coolly
resigned
to
execution
.
The
nurse
bent
over
me
and
called
my
name
.
I
pulled
away
and
crouched
farther
into
the
corner
.
The
nurse
disappeared
.
I
knew
she
would
return
,
in
a
minute
,
with
two
burly
men
attendants
,
and
they
would
bear
me
,
howling
and
hitting
,
past
the
smiling
audience
now
gathered
in
the
lounge
.
Doctor
Nolan
put
her
arm
around
me
and
hugged
me
like
a
mother
.
``
You
said
you
'd
tell
me
!
''
I
shouted
at
her
through
the
dishevelled
blanket
.
``
But
I
am
telling
you
,
''
Doctor
Nolan
said
.
``
I
've
come
specially
early
to
tell
you
,
and
I
'm
taking
you
over
myself
.
''
I
peered
at
her
through
swollen
lids
.
``
Why
did
n't
you
tell
me
last
night
?
''
``
I
only
thought
it
would
keep
you
awake
.
If
I
'd
known
.
.
.
''
``
You
said
you
'd
tell
me
.
''
``
Listen
,
Esther
,
''
Doctor
Nolan
said
.
``
I
'm
going
over
with
you
.
I
'll
be
there
the
whole
time
,
so
everything
will
happen
right
,
the
way
I
promised
.
I
'll
be
there
when
you
wake
up
,
and
I
'll
bring
you
back
again
.
''
I
looked
at
her
.
She
seemed
very
upset
I
waited
a
minute
.
Then
I
said
,
``
Promise
you
'll
be
there
.
''
``
I
promise
.
''
Doctor
Nolan
took
out
a
white
handkerchief
and
wiped
my
face
.
Then
she
hooked
her
arm
in
my
arm
,
like
an
old
friend
,
and
helped
me
up
,
and
we
started
down
the
hall
.
My
blanket
tangled
about
my
feet
,
so
I
let
it
drop
,
but
Doctor
Nolan
did
n't
seem
to
notice
.
We
passed
Joan
,
coming
out
of
her
room
,
and
I
gave
her
a
meaning
,
disdainful
smile
and
she
ducked
back
and
waited
until
we
had
gone
by
.
Then
Doctor
Nolan
unlocked
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
led
me
down
a
flight
of
stairs
into
the
mysterious
basement
corridors
that
linked
,
in
an
elaborate
network
of
tunnels
and
burrows
,
all
the
various
buildings
of
the
hospital
.
The
walls
were
bright
,
white
lavatory
tile
with
bald
bulbs
set
at
intervals
in
the
black
ceiling
.
Stretchers
and
wheelchairs
were
beached
here
and
there
against
the
hissing
,
knocking
pipes
that
ran
and
branched
in
an
intricate
nervous
system
along
the
glittering
walls
.
I
hung
on
to
Doctor
Nolan
's
arm
like
death
,
and
every
so
often
she
gave
me
an
encouraging
squeeze
.
Finally
,
we
stopped
at
a
green
door
with
Electrotherapy
printed
on
it
in
black
letters
.
I
held
back
,
and
Doctor
Nolan
waited
.
Then
I
said
,
``
Let
's
get
it
over
with
,
''
and
we
went
in
.
The
only
people
in
the
waiting
room
besides
Doctor
Nolan
and
me
were
a
pallid
man
in
a
shabby
maroon
bathrobe
and
his
accompanying
nurse
.
``
Do
you
want
to
sit
down
?
''
Doctor
Nolan
pointed
at
a
wooden
bench
,
but
my
legs
felt
full
of
heaviness
,
and
I
thought
how
hard
it
would
be
to
hoist
myself
from
a
sitting
position
when
the
shock
treatment
people
came
in
.
``
I
'd
rather
stand
.
''
At
last
a
tall
,
cadaverous
woman
in
a
white
smock
entered
the
room
from
an
inner
door
.
I
thought
that
she
would
go
up
and
take
the
man
in
the
maroon
bathrobe
,
as
he
was
first
,
so
I
was
surprised
when
she
came
toward
me
.
``
Good
morning
,
Doctor
Nolan
,
''
the
woman
said
,
putting
her
arm
around
my
shoulders
.
``
Is
this
Esther
?
''
``
Yes
,
Miss
Huey
.
Esther
,
this
is
Miss
Huey
,
she
'll
take
good
care
of
you
.
I
've
told
her
about
you
.
''
I
thought
the
woman
must
be
seven
feet
tall
.
She
bent
over
me
in
a
kind
way
,
and
I
could
see
that
her
face
,
with
the
buck
teeth
protruding
in
the
center
,
had
at
one
time
been
badly
pitted
with
acne
.
It
looked
like
maps
of
the
craters
on
the
moon
.
``
I
think
we
can
take
you
right
away
,
Esther
,
''
Miss
Huey
said
.
``
Mr.
Anderson
wo
n't
mind
waiting
,
will
you
,
Mr
.
Anderson
?
''
Mr.
Anderson
did
n't
say
a
word
,
so
with
Miss
Huey
's
arm
around
my
shoulder
,
and
Doctor
Nolan
following
,
I
moved
into
the
next
room
.
Through
the
slits
of
my
eyes
,
which
I
did
n't
dare
open
too
far
,
lest
the
full
view
strike
me
dead
,
I
saw
the
high
bed
with
its
white
,
drumtight
sheet
,
and
the
machine
behind
the
bed
,
and
the
masked
person
--
I
could
n't
tell
whether
it
was
a
man
or
a
woman
--
behind
the
machine
,
and
other
masked
people
flanking
the
bed
on
both
sides
.
Miss
Huey
helped
me
climb
up
and
lie
down
on
my
back
.
``
Talk
to
me
,
''
I
said
.
Miss
Huey
began
to
talk
in
a
low
,
soothing
voice
,
smoothing
the
salve
on
my
temples
and
fitting
the
small
electric
buttons
on
either
side
of
my
head
.
``
You
'll
be
perfectly
all
right
,
you
wo
n't
feel
a
thing
,
just
bite
down
.
.
.
''
And
she
set
something
on
my
tongue
and
in
panic
I
bit
down
,
and
darkness
wiped
me
out
like
chalk
on
a
blackboard
.
Eighteen
``
ESTHER
.
''
I
woke
out
of
a
deep
,
drenched
sleep
,
and
the
first
thing
I
saw
was
Doctor
Nolan
's
face
swimming
in
front
of
me
and
saying
,
``
Esther
,
Esther
.
''
I
rubbed
my
eyes
with
an
awkward
hand
.
Behind
Doctor
Nolan
I
could
see
the
body
of
a
woman
wearing
a
rumpled
black-and-white
checked
robe
and
flung
out
on
a
cot
as
if
dropped
from
a
great
height
.
But
before
I
could
take
in
any
more
,
Doctor
Nolan
led
me
through
a
door
into
a
fresh
,
blue-skied
air
.
All
the
heat
and
fear
purged
itself
.
I
felt
surprisingly
at
peace
.
The
bell
jar
hung
,
suspended
,
a
few
feet
above
my
head
.
I
was
open
to
the
circulating
air
.
``
It
was
like
I
told
you
it
would
be
,
was
n't
it
?
''
said
Doctor
Nolan
,
as
we
walked
back
to
Belsize
together
through
the
crunch
of
brown
leaves
.
``
Yes
.
''
``
Well
,
it
will
always
be
like
that
,
''
she
said
firmly
.
``
You
will
be
having
shock
treatments
three
times
a
week
--
Tuesday
,
Thursday
and
Saturday
.
''
I
gulped
in
a
long
draught
of
air
.
``
For
how
long
?
''
``
That
depends
,
''
Doctor
Nolan
said
,
``
on
you
and
me
.
''
I
took
up
the
silver
knife
and
cracked
off
the
cap
of
my
egg
.
Then
I
put
down
the
knife
and
looked
at
it
.
I
tried
to
think
what
I
had
loved
knives
for
,
but
my
mind
slipped
from
the
noose
of
the
thought
and
swung
,
like
a
bird
,
in
the
center
of
empty
air
.
Joan
and
DeeDee
were
sitting
side
by
side
on
the
piano
bench
,
and
DeeDee
was
teaching
Joan
to
play
the
bottom
half
of
``
Chopsticks
''
while
she
played
the
top
.
I
thought
how
sad
it
was
Joan
looked
so
horsey
,
with
such
big
teeth
and
eyes
like
two
gray
,
goggly
pebbles
.
Why
,
she
could
n't
even
keep
a
boy
like
Buddy
Willard
.
And
DeeDee
's
husband
was
obviously
living
with
some
mistress
or
other
and
turning
her
sour
as
an
old
fusty
cat
.
``
I
've
got
a
let-ter
,
''
Joan
chanted
,
poking
her
tousled
head
inside
my
door
.
``
Good
for
you
.
''
I
kept
my
eyes
on
my
book
.
Ever
since
the
shock
treatments
had
ended
,
after
a
brief
series
of
five
,
and
I
had
town
privileges
,
Joan
hung
about
me
like
a
large
and
breathless
fruitfly
--
as
if
the
sweetness
of
recovery
were
something
she
could
suck
up
by
mere
nearness
.
They
had
taken
away
her
physics
books
and
the
piles
of
dusty
spiral
pads
full
of
lecture
notes
that
had
ringed
her
room
,
and
she
was
confined
to
grounds
again
.
``
Do
n't
you
want
to
know
who
it
's
from
?
''
Joan
edged
into
the
room
and
sat
down
on
my
bed
.
I
wanted
to
tell
her
to
get
the
hell
out
,
she
gave
me
the
creeps
,
only
I
could
n't
do
it
.
``
All
right
.
''
I
stuck
my
finger
in
my
place
and
shut
the
book
.
``
Who
from
?
''
Joan
slipped
out
a
pale
blue
envelope
from
her
skirt
pocket
and
waved
it
teasingly
.
``
Well
,
is
n't
that
a
coincidence
!
''
I
said
.
``
What
do
you
mean
,
a
coincidence
?
''
I
went
over
to
my
bureau
,
picked
up
a
pale
blue
envelope
and
waved
it
at
Joan
like
a
parting
handkerchief
.
``
I
got
a
letter
too
.
I
wonder
if
they
're
the
same
.
''
``
He
's
better
,
''
Joan
said
.
``
He
's
out
of
the
hospital
.
''
There
was
a
little
pause
.
``
Are
you
going
to
marry
him
?
''
``
No
,
''
I
said
.
``
Are
you
?
''
Joan
grinned
evasively
.
``
I
did
n't
like
him
much
,
anyway
.
''
``
Oh
?
''
``
No
,
it
was
his
family
I
liked
.
''
``
You
mean
Mr.
and
Mrs
.
Willard
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
Joan
's
voice
slid
down
my
spine
like
a
draft
.
``
I
loved
them
.
They
were
so
nice
,
so
happy
,
nothing
like
my
parents
.
I
went
over
to
see
them
all
the
time
,
''
she
paused
,
``
until
you
came
.
''
``
I
'm
sorry
.
''
Then
I
added
,
``
Why
did
n't
you
go
on
seeing
them
,
if
you
liked
them
so
much
?
''
``
Oh
,
I
could
n't
,
''
Joan
said
.
``
Not
with
you
dating
Buddy
.
It
would
have
looked
.
.
.
I
do
n't
know
,
funny
.
''
I
considered
.
``
I
suppose
so
.
''
``
Are
you
,
''
Joan
hesitated
,
``
going
to
let
him
come
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
At
first
I
had
thought
it
would
be
awful
having
Buddy
come
and
visit
me
at
the
asylum
--
he
would
probably
only
come
to
gloat
and
hobnob
with
the
other
doctors
.
But
then
it
seemed
to
me
it
would
be
a
step
,
placing
him
,
renouncing
him
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
I
had
nobody
--
telling
him
there
was
no
simultaneous
interpreter
,
nobody
,
but
that
he
was
the
wrong
one
,
that
I
had
stopped
hanging
on
.
``
Are
you
?
''
``
Yes
,
''
Joan
breathed
.
``
Maybe
he
'll
bring
his
mother
.
I
'm
going
to
ask
him
to
bring
his
mother
.
.
.
''
``
His
mother
?
''
Joan
pouted
.
``
I
like
Mrs.
Willard
.
Mrs.
Willard
's
a
wonderful
,
wonderful
woman
.
She
's
been
a
real
mother
to
me
.
''
I
had
a
picture
of
Mrs.
Willard
,
with
her
heather-mixture
tweeds
and
her
sensible
shoes
and
her
wise
,
maternal
maxims
.
Mr.
Willard
was
her
little
boy
,
and
his
voice
was
high
and
dear
,
like
a
little
boy
's
.
Joan
and
Mrs.
Willard
.
Joan
.
.
.
and
Mrs.
Willard
.
.
.
I
had
knocked
on
DeeDee
's
door
that
morning
,
wanting
to
borrow
some
two-part
sheet
music
.
I
waited
a
few
minutes
and
then
,
hearing
no
answer
and
thinking
DeeDee
must
be
out
,
and
I
could
pick
up
the
music
from
her
bureau
,
I
pushed
the
door
open
and
stepped
into
the
room
.
At
Belsize
,
even
at
Belsize
,
the
doors
had
locks
,
but
the
patients
had
no
keys
.
A
shut
door
meant
privacy
,
and
was
respected
,
like
a
locked
door
.
One
knocked
,
and
knocked
again
,
then
went
away
.
I
remembered
this
as
I
stood
,
my
eyes
half-useless
after
the
brilliance
of
the
hall
,
in
the
room
's
deep
,
musky
dark
.
As
my
vision
cleared
,
I
saw
a
shape
rise
from
the
bed
.
Then
somebody
gave
a
low
giggle
.
The
shape
adjusted
its
hair
,
and
two
pale
,
pebble
eyes
regarded
me
through
the
gloom
.
DeeDee
lay
back
on
the
pillows
,
bare-legged
under
her
green
wool
dressing
gown
,
and
watched
me
with
a
little
mocking
smile
.
A
cigarette
glowed
between
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
.
``
I
just
wanted
.
.
.
''
I
said
.
``
I
know
,
''
said
DeeDee
.
``
The
music
.
''
``
Hello
,
Esther
,
''
Joan
said
then
,
and
her
cornhusk
voice
made
me
want
to
puke
.
``
Wait
for
me
,
Esther
,
I
'll
come
play
the
bottom
part
with
you
.
''
Now
Joan
said
stoutly
,
``
I
never
really
liked
Buddy
Willard
.
He
thought
he
knew
everything
.
He
thought
he
knew
everything
about
women
.
.
.
''
I
looked
at
Joan
.
In
spite
of
the
creepy
feeling
,
and
in
spite
of
my
old
,
ingrained
dislike
,
Joan
fascinated
me
.
It
was
like
observing
a
Martian
,
or
a
particularly
warty
toad
.
Her
thoughts
were
not
my
thoughts
,
nor
her
feelings
my
feelings
,
but
we
were
close
enough
so
that
her
thoughts
and
feelings
seemed
a
wry
,
black
image
of
my
own
.
Sometimes
I
wondered
if
I
had
made
Joan
up
.
Other
times
I
wondered
if
she
would
continue
to
pop
in
at
every
crisis
of
my
life
to
remind
me
of
what
I
had
been
,
and
what
I
had
been
through
,
and
carry
on
her
own
separate
but
similar
crisis
under
my
nose
.
``
I
do
n't
see
what
women
see
in
other
women
,
''
I
'd
told
Doctor
Nolan
in
my
interview
that
noon
.
``
What
does
a
woman
see
in
a
woman
that
she
ca
n't
see
in
a
man
?
''
Doctor
Nokn
paused
.
Then
she
said
,
``
Tenderness
.
''
That
shut
me
up
.
``
I
like
you
,
''
Joan
was
saying
.
``
I
like
you
better
than
Buddy
.
''
And
as
she
stretched
out
on
my
bed
with
a
silly
smile
,
I
remembered
a
minor
scandal
at
our
college
dormitory
when
a
fat
,
matronly-breasted
senior
,
homely
as
a
grandmother
and
a
pious
Religion
major
,
and
a
tall
,
gawky
freshman
with
a
history
of
being
deserted
at
an
early
hour
in
all
sorts
of
ingenious
ways
by
her
blind
dates
,
started
seeing
too
much
of
each
other
.
They
were
always
together
,
and
once
somebody
had
come
upon
them
embracing
,
the
story
went
,
in
the
fat
girl
's
room
.
``
But
what
were
they
doing
?
''
I
had
asked
.
Whenever
I
thought
about
men
and
men
,
and
women
and
women
,
I
could
never
really
imagine
what
they
would
be
actually
doing
.
``
Oh
,
''
the
spy
had
said
,
``
Milly
was
sitting
on
the
chair
and
Theodora
was
lying
on
the
bed
,
and
Milly
was
stroking
Theodora
's
hair
.
''
I
was
disappointed
.
I
had
thought
I
would
have
some
revelation
of
specific
evil
.
I
wondered
if
all
women
did
with
other
women
was
lie
and
hug
.
Of
course
,
the
famous
woman
poet
at
my
college
lived
with
another
woman
--
a
stumpy
old
Classical
scholar
with
a
cropped
Dutch
cut
.
And
when
I
had
told
the
poet
I
might
well
get
married
and
have
a
pack
of
children
someday
,
she
stared
at
me
in
horror
.
``
But
what
about
your
career
?
''
she
had
cried
.
My
head
ached
.
Why
did
I
attract
these
weird
old
women
?
There
was
the
famous
poet
,
and
Philomena
Guinea
,
and
Jay
Cee
,
and
the
Christian
Scientist
lady
and
lord
knows
who
,
and
they
all
wanted
to
adopt
me
in
some
way
,
and
,
for
the
price
of
their
care
and
influence
,
have
me
resemble
them
.
``
I
like
you
.
''
``
That
's
tough
,
Joan
,
''
I
said
,
picking
up
my
book
.
``
Because
I
do
n't
like
you
.
You
make
me
puke
,
if
you
want
to
know
.
''
And
I
walked
out
of
the
room
,
leaving
Joan
lying
,
lumpy
as
an
old
horse
,
across
my
bed
.
I
waited
for
the
doctor
,
wondering
if
I
should
bolt
.
I
knew
what
I
was
doing
was
illegal
--
in
Massachusetts
,
anyway
,
because
the
state
was
cram-jam
full
of
Catholics
--
but
Doctor
Nolan
said
this
doctor
was
an
old
friend
of
hers
,
and
a
wise
man
.
``
What
's
your
appointment
for
?
''
the
brisk
,
white-uniformed
receptionist
wanted
to
know
,
ticking
my
name
off
on
a
notebook
list
.
``
What
do
you
mean
,
for
?
''
I
had
n't
thought
anybody
but
the
doctor
himself
would
ask
me
that
,
and
the
communal
waiting
room
was
full
of
other
patients
waiting
for
other
doctors
,
most
of
them
pregnant
or
with
babies
,
and
I
felt
their
eyes
on
my
flat
,
virgin
stomach
.
The
receptionist
glanced
up
at
me
,
and
I
blushed
.
``
A
fitting
,
is
n't
it
?
''
she
said
kindly
.
``
I
only
wanted
to
make
sure
so
I
'd
know
what
to
charge
you
.
Are
you
a
student
?
''
``
Ye-es
.
''
``
That
will
only
be
half-price
then
.
Five
dollars
,
instead
of
ten
.
Shall
I
bill
you
?
''
I
was
about
to
give
my
home
address
,
where
I
would
probably
be
by
the
time
the
bill
arrived
,
but
then
I
thought
of
my
mother
opening
the
bill
and
seeing
what
it
was
for
.
The
only
other
address
I
had
was
the
innocuous
box
number
which
people
used
who
did
n't
want
to
advertise
the
fact
they
lived
in
an
asylum
.
But
I
thought
the
receptionist
might
recognize
the
box
number
,
so
I
said
,
``
I
better
pay
now
,
''
and
peeled
five
dollar
notes
off
the
roll
in
my
pocketbook
.
The
five
dollars
was
part
of
what
Philomena
Guinea
had
sent
me
as
a
sort
of
get-
well
present
.
I
wondered
what
she
would
think
if
she
knew
to
what
use
her
money
was
being
put
.
Whether
she
knew
it
or
not
,
Philomena
Guinea
was
buying
my
freedom
,
``
What
I
hate
is
the
thought
of
being
under
a
man
's
thumb
,
''
I
had
told
Doctor
Nolan
.
``
A
man
does
n't
have
a
worry
in
the
world
,
while
I
've
got
a
baby
hanging
over
my
head
like
a
big
stick
,
to
keep
me
in
line
.
''
``
Would
you
act
differently
if
you
did
n't
have
to
worry
about
a
baby
?
''
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
,
``
but
.
.
.
''
and
I
told
Doctor
Nolan
about
the
married
woman
lawyer
and
her
Defense
of
Chastity
.
Doctor
Nolan
waited
until
I
was
finished
.
Then
she
burst
out
laughing
.
``
Propaganda
!
''
she
said
,
and
scribbled
the
name
and
address
of
this
doctor
on
a
prescription
pad
.
I
leafed
nervously
through
an
issue
of
Baby
Talk
.
The
fat
,
bright
faces
of
babies
beamed
up
at
me
,
page
after
page
--
bald
babies
,
chocolate-colored
babies
,
Eisenhower-
faced
babies
,
babies
rolling
over
for
the
first
time
,
babies
reaching
for
rattles
,
babies
eating
their
first
spoonful
of
solid
food
,
babies
doing
all
the
little
tricky
things
it
takes
to
grow
up
,
step
by
step
,
into
an
anxious
and
unsettling
world
.
I
smelt
a
mingling
of
Pablum
and
sour
milk
and
salt-cod-stinky
diapers
and
felt
sorrowful
and
tender
.
HOW
easy
having
babies
seemed
to
the
women
around
me
!
Why
was
I
so
unmaternal
and
apart
?
Why
could
n't
I
dream
of
devoting
myself
to
baby
after
fat
puling
baby
like
Dodo
Conway
?
If
I
had
to
wait
on
a
baby
all
day
,
I
would
go
mad
.
I
looked
at
the
baby
in
the
lap
of
the
woman
opposite
.
I
had
no
idea
how
old
it
was
,
I
never
did
,
with
babies
--
for
all
I
knew
it
could
talk
a
blue
streak
and
had
twenty
teeth
behind
its
pursed
,
pink
lips
.
It
held
its
little
wobby
head
up
on
its
shoulders
--
it
did
n't
seem
to
have
a
neck
--
and
observed
me
with
a
wise
,
Platonic
expression
.
The
baby
's
mother
smiled
and
smiled
,
holding
that
baby
as
if
it
were
the
first
wonder
of
the
world
.
I
watched
the
mother
and
the
baby
for
some
clue
to
their
mutual
satisfaction
,
but
before
I
had
discovered
anything
,
the
doctor
called
me
in
.
``
You
'd
like
a
fitting
,
''
he
said
cheerfully
,
and
I
thought
with
relief
that
he
was
n't
the
sort
of
doctor
to
ask
awkward
questions
.
I
had
toyed
with
the
idea
of
telling
him
I
planned
to
be
married
to
a
sailor
as
soon
as
his
ship
docked
at
the
Charlestown
Navy
Yard
,
and
the
reason
I
did
n't
have
an
engagement
ring
was
because
we
were
too
poor
,
but
at
the
last
moment
I
rejected
that
appealing
story
and
simply
said
``
Yes
.
''
I
climbed
up
on
the
examination
table
,
thinking
:
``
I
am
climbing
to
freedom
,
freedom
from
fear
,
freedom
from
marrying
the
wrong
person
,
like
Buddy
Willard
,
just
because
of
sex
,
freedom
from
the
Florence
Crittenden
Homes
where
all
the
poor
girls
go
who
should
have
been
fitted
out
like
me
,
because
what
they
did
,
they
would
do
anyway
,
regardless
.
.
.
''
As
I
rode
back
to
the
asylum
with
my
box
in
the
plain
brown
paper
wrapper
on
my
lap
I
might
have
been
Mrs
.
Anybody
coming
back
from
a
day
in
town
with
a
Schrafft
's
cake
for
her
maiden
aunt
or
a
Filene
's
Basement
hat
.
Gradually
the
suspicion
that
Catholics
had
X-ray
eyes
diminished
,
and
I
grew
easy
.
I
had
done
well
by
my
shopping
privileges
,
I
thought
.
I
was
my
own
woman
.
The
next
step
was
to
find
the
proper
sort
of
man
.
Nineteen
``
I
'm
going
to
be
a
psychiatrist
.
''
Joan
spoke
with
her
usual
breathy
enthusiasm
.
We
were
drinking
apple
cider
in
the
Belsize
lounge
.
``
Oh
,
''
I
said
dryly
,
``
that
's
nice
.
''
``
I
've
had
a
long
talk
with
Doctor
Quinn
,
and
she
thinks
it
's
perfectly
possible
.
''
Doctor
Quinn
was
Joan
's
psychiatrist
,
a
bright
,
shrewd
,
single
lady
,
and
I
often
thought
if
I
had
been
assigned
to
Doctor
Quinn
I
would
be
still
in
Caplan
or
,
more
probably
,
Wymark
.
Doctor
Quinn
had
an
abstract
quality
that
appealed
to
Joan
,
but
it
gave
me
the
polar
chills
.
Joan
chattered
on
about
Egos
and
Ids
,
and
I
turned
my
mind
to
something
else
,
to
the
brown
,
unwrapped
package
in
my
bottom
drawer
.
I
never
talked
about
Egos
and
Ids
with
Doctor
Nolan
.
I
did
n't
know
just
what
I
talked
about
really
.
``
.
.
.
I
'm
going
to
live
out
,
now
.
''
I
tuned
in
on
Joan
then
.
``
Where
?
''
I
demanded
,
trying
to
hide
my
envy
.
Doctor
Nolan
said
my
college
would
take
me
back
for
the
second
semester
,
on
her
recommendation
and
Philomena
Guinea
's
scholarship
,
but
as
the
doctors
vetoed
my
living
with
my
mother
in
the
interim
,
I
was
staying
on
at
the
asylum
until
the
winter
term
began
.
Even
so
,
I
felt
it
unfair
of
Joan
to
beat
me
through
the
gates
.
``
Where
?
''
I
persisted
.
``
They
're
not
letting
you
live
on
your
own
,
are
they
?
''
Joan
had
only
that
week
been
given
town
privileges
again
.
``
Oh
no
,
of
course
not
.
I
'm
living
in
Cambridge
with
Nurse
Kennedy
.
Her
roommate
's
just
got
married
,
and
she
needs
someone
to
share
the
apartment
.
''
``
Cheers
.
''
I
raised
my
apple
cider
glass
,
and
we
clinked
.
In
spite
of
my
profound
reservations
,
I
thought
I
would
always
treasure
Joan
.
It
was
as
if
we
had
been
forced
together
by
some
overwhelming
circumstance
,
like
war
or
plague
,
and
shared
a
world
of
our
own
.
``
When
are
you
leaving
?
''
``
On
the
first.of
the
month
.
''
``
Nice
.
''
Joan
grew
wistful
``
You
'll
come
visit
me
,
wo
n't
you
,
Esther
?
''
``
Of
course
.
''
But
I
thought
,
``
Not
likely
.
''
``
It
hurts
,
''
I
said
.
``
Is
it
supposed
to
hurt
?
''
Irwin
did
n't
say
anything
.
Then
he
said
,
``
Sometimes
it
hurts
.
''
I
had
met
Irwin
on
the
steps
of
the
Widener
Library
.
I
was
standing
at
the
top
of
the
long
flight
,
overlooking
the
red
brick
buildings
that
walled
the
snow-filled
quad
and
preparing
to
catch
the
trolley
back
to
the
asylum
,
when
a
tall
young
man
with
a
rather
ugly
and
bespectacled
,
but
intelligent
face
,
came
up
and
said
,
``
Could
you
please
tell
me
the
time
?
''
I
glanced
at
my
watch
.
``
Five
past
four
.
''
Then
the
man
shifted
his
arms
around
the
load
of
books
he
was
carrying
before
him
like
a
dinner
tray
and
revealed
a
bony
wrist
.
``
Why
,
you
've
a
watch
yourself
!
''
The
man
looked
ruefully
at
his
watch
.
He
lifted
it
and
shook
it
by
his
ear
.
``
Does
n't
work
.
''
He
smiled
engagingly
.
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
I
was
about
to
say
,
``
Back
to
the
asylum
,
''
but
the
man
looked
promising
,
so
I
changed
my
mind
.
``
Home
.
''
``
Would
you
like
some
coffee
first
?
''
I
hesitated
.
I
was
due
at
the
asylum
for
supper
and
I
did
n't
want
to
be
late
so
close
to
being
signed
out
of
there
for
good
.
``
A
very
small
cup
of
coffee
?
''
I
decided
to
practice
my
new
,
normal
personality
on
this
man
who
,
in
the
course
of
my
hesitations
,
told
me
his
name
was
Irwin
and
that
he
was
a
very
well-paid
professor
of
mathematics
,
so
I
said
,
``
All
right
,
''
and
,
matching
my
stride
to
Irwin
's
,
strolled
down
the
long
,
ice-encrusted
flight
at
his
side
.
It
was
only
after
seeing
Irwin
's
study
that
I
decided
to
seduce
him
.
Irwin
lived
in
a
murky
,
comfortable
basement
apartment
in
one
of
the
rundown
streets
of
outer
Cambridge
and
drove
me
there
--
for
a
beer
,
he
said
--
after
three
cups
of
bitter
coffee
in
a
student
cafe
.
We
sat
in
his
study
on
stuffed
brown
leather
chairs
,
surrounded
by
stacks
of
dusty
,
incomprehensible
books
with
huge
formulas
inset
artistically
on
the
page
like
poems
.
While
I
was
sipping
my
first
glass
of
beer
--
I
have
never
really
cared
for
cold
beer
in
midwinter
,
but
I
accepted
the
glass
to
have
something
solid
to
hold
on
to
--
the
doorbell
rang
.
Irwin
seemed
embarrassed
.
``
I
think
it
may
be
a
lady
.
''
Irwin
had
a
queer
,
old-world
habit
of
calling
women
ladies
.
``
Fine
,
fine
,
''
I
gestured
largely
.
``
Bring
her
in
.
''
Irwin
shook
his
head
.
``
You
would
upset
her
.
''
I
smiled
into
my
amber
cylinder
of
cold
beer
.
The
doorbell
rang
again
with
a
peremptory
jab
.
Irwin
sighed
and
rose
to
answer
it
.
The
minute
he
disappeared
,
I
whipped
into
the
bathroom
and
,
concealed
behind
the
dirty
,
aluminum-colored
Venetian
blind
,
watched
Irwin
's
monkish
face
appear
in
the
door
crack
.
A
large
,
bosomy
Slavic
lady
in
a
bulky
sweater
of
natural
sheep
's
wool
,
purple
slacks
,
high-heeled
black
overshoes
with
Persian
lamb
cuffs
and
a
matching
toque
,
puffed
white
,
inaudible
words
into
the
wintry
air
.
Irwin
's
voice
drifted
back
to
me
through
the
chilly
hall
.
``
I
'm
sorry
,
Olga
.
.
.
I
'm
working
,
Olga
.
.
.
no
,
I
do
n't
think
so
,
Olga
,
''
all
the
while
the
lady
's
red
mouth
moved
and
the
words
,
translated
to
white
smoke
,
floated
up
among
the
branches
of
the
naked
lilac
by
the
door
.
Then
,
finally
,
``
Perhaps
,
Olga
.
.
.
good-bye
,
Olga
.
''
I
admired
the
immense
,
steppelike
expanse
of
the
lady
's
wool-clad
bosom
as
she
retreated
a
few
inches
from
my
eye
,
down
the
creaking
wooden
stair
,
a
sort
of
Siberian
bitterness
on
her
vivid
lips
.
``
I
suppose
you
have
lots
and
lots
of
affairs
in
Cambridge
,
''
I
told
Irwin
cheerily
,
as
I
stuck
a
snail
with
a
pin
in
one
of
Cambridge
's
determinedly
French
restaurants
.
``
I
seem
,
''
Irwin
admitted
with
a
small
,
modest
smile
,
``
to
get
on
with
the
ladies
.
''
I
picked
up
my
empty
snail
shell
and
drank
the
herb-green
juice
.
I
had
no
idea
if
this
was
proper
,
but
after
months
of
wholesome
,
dull
asylum
diet
,
I
was
greedy
for
butter
.
I
had
called
Doctor
Nolan
from
a
pay
phone
at
the
restaurant
and
asked
for
permission
to
stay
overnight
in
Cambridge
with
Joan
.
Of
course
,
I
had
no
idea
whether
Irwin
would
invite
me
back
to
his
apartment
after
dinner
or
not
,
but
I
thought
his
dismissal
of
the
Slavic
lady
--
another
professor
's
wife
--
looked
promising
.
I
tipped
back
my
head
and
poured
down
a
glass
of
Nuits-St.-Georges
.
``
You
do
like
wine
,
''
Irwin
observed
.
``
Only
Nuits-St.-Georges
.
I
imagine
him
.
.
.
with
the
dragon
.
.
.
''
Irwin
reached
for
my
hand
.
I
felt
the
first
man
I
slept
with
must
be
intelligent
,
so
I
would
respect
him
.
Irwin
was
a
full
professor
at
twenty-six
and
had
the
pale
,
hairless
skin
of
a
boy
genius
.
I
also
needed
somebody
quite
experienced
to
make
up
for
my
lack
of
it
,
and
Irwin
's
ladies
reassured
me
on
this
head
.
Then
,
to
be
on
the
safe
side
,
I
wanted
somebody
I
did
n't
know
and
would
n't
go
on
knowing
--
a
kind
of
impersonal
,
priestlike
official
,
as
in
the
tales
of
tribal
rites
.
By
the
end
of
the
evening
I
had
no
doubts
about
Irwin
whatsoever
.
Ever
since
I
'd
learned
about
the
corruption
of
Buddy
Willard
my
virginity
weighed
like
a
millstone
around
my
neck
.
It
had
been
of
such
enormous
importance
to
me
for
so
long
that
my
habit
was
to
defend
it
at
all
costs
.
I
had
been
defending
it
for
five
years
and
I
was
sick
of
it
.
It
was
only
as
Irwin
swung
me
into
his
arms
,
back
at
the
apartment
,
and
carried
me
,
wine-dazed
and
limp
,
into
the
pitch-black
bedroom
,
that
I
murmured
,
``
You
know
,
Irwin
,
I
think
I
ought
to
tell
you
,
I
'm
a
virgin
.
''
Irwin
laughed
and
flung
me
down
on
the
bed
.
A
few
minutes
later
an
exclamation
of
surprise
revealed
that
Irwin
had
n't
really
believed
me
.
I
thought
how
lucky
it
was
I
had
started
practicing
birth
control
during
the
day
,
because
in
my
winey
state
that
night
I
would
never
have
bothered
to
perform
the
delicate
and
necessary
operation
.
I
lay
,
rapt
and
naked
,
on
Irwin
's
rough
blanket
,
waiting
for
the
miraculous
change
to
make
itself
felt
.
But
all
I
felt
was
a
sharp
,
startlingly
bad
pain
.
``
It
hurts
,
''
I
said
.
``
Is
it
supposed
to
hurt
?
''
Irwin
did
n't
say
anything
.
Then
he
said
,
``
Sometimes
it
hurts
.
''
After
a
little
while
Irwin
got
up
and
went
into
the
bathroom
,
and
I
heard
the
rushing
of
shower
water
.
I
was
n't
sure
if
Irwin
had
done
what
he
planned
to
do
,
or
if
my
virginity
had
obstructed
him
in
some
way
.
I
wanted
to
ask
him
if
I
was
still
a
virgin
,
but
I
felt
too
unsettled
.
A
warm
liquid
was
seeping
out
between
my
legs
.
Tentatively
,
I
reached
down
and
touched
it
.
When
I
held
my
hand
up
to
the
light
streaming
in
from
the
bathroom
,
my
fingertips
looked
black
.
``
Irwin
,
''
I
said
nervously
,
``
bring
me
a
towel
.
''
Irwin
strolled
back
,
a
bathtowel
knotted
around
his
waist
,
and
tossed
me
a
second
,
smaller
towel
.
I
pushed
the
towel
between
my
legs
and
pulled
it
away
almost
immediately
.
It
was
half
black
with
blood
.
``
I
'm
bleeding
!
''
I
announced
,
sitting
up
with
a
start
.
``
Oh
,
that
often
happens
,
''
Irwin
reassured
me
.
``
You
'll
be
all
right
.
''
Then
the
stories
of
blood-stained
bridal
sheets
and
capsules
of
red
ink
bestowed
on
already
deflowered
brides
floated
back
to
me
.
I
wondered
how
much
I
would
bleed
,
and
lay
down
,
nursing
the
towel
.
It
occurred
to
me
that
the
blood
was
my
answer
.
I
could
n't
possibly
be
a
virgin
any
more
.
I
smiled
into
the
dark
.
I
felt
part
of
a
great
tradition
.
Surreptitiously
,
I
applied
a
fresh
section
of
white
towel
to
my
wound
,
thinking
that
as
soon
as
the
bleeding
stopped
,
I
would
take
the
late
trolley
back
to
the
asylum
.
I
wanted
to
brood
over
my
new
condition
in
perfect
peace
.
But
the
towel
came
away
black
and
dripping
.
``
I.
.
.
think
I
better
go
home
,
''
I
said
faintly
.
``
Surely
not
so
soon
.
''
``
Yes
,
I
think
I
better
.
''
I
asked
if
I
could
borrow
Irwin
's
towel
and
packed
it
between
my
thighs
as
a
bandage
.
Then
I
pulled
on
my
sweaty
clothes
.
Irwin
offered
to
drive
me
home
,
but
I
did
n't
see
how
I
could
let
him
drive
me
to
the
asylum
,
so
I
dug
in
my
pocketbook
for
Joan
's
address
.
Irwin
knew
the
street
and
went
out
to
start
the
car
.
I
was
too
worried
to
tell
him
I
was
still
bleeding
.
I
kept
hoping
every
minute
that
it
would
stop
.
But
as
Irwin
drove
me
through
the
barren
,
snow-banked
streets
I
felt
the
warm
seepage
let
itself
through
the
dam
of
the
towel
and
my
skirt
and
onto
the
car
seat
.
As
we
slowed
,
cruising
by
house
after
lit
house
,
I
thought
how
fortunate
it
was
I
had
not
discarded
my
virginity
while
living
at
college
or
at
home
,
where
such
concealment
would
have
been
impossible
.
Joan
opened
the
door
with
an
expression
of
glad
surprise
.
Irwin
kissed
my
hand
and
told
Joan
to
take
good
care
of
me
.
I
shut
the
door
and
leaned
back
against
it
,
feeling
the
blood
drain
from
my
face
in
one
spectacular
flush
.
``
Why
,
Esther
,
''
Joan
said
,
``
what
on
earth
's
the
matter
?
''
I
wondered
when
Joan
would
notice
the
blood
trickling
down
my
legs
and
oozing
,
stickily
,
into
each
black
patent
leather
shoe
.
I
thought
I
could
be
dying
from
a
bullet
wound
and
Joan
would
still
stare
through
me
with
her
blank
eyes
,
expecting
me
to
ask
for
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
sandwich
.
``
Is
that
nurse
here
?
''
``
No
,
she
's
on
night
duty
at
Caplan
.
.
.
''
``
Good
.
''
I
made
a
little
bitter
grin
as
another
soak
of
blood
let
itself
through
the
drenched
padding
and
started
the
tedious
journey
into
my
shoes
.
``
I
mean
.
.
.
bad
.
''
``
You
look
funny
,
''
Joan
said
.
``
You
better
get
a
doctor
.
''
``
Why
?
''
``
Quick
''
``
But
.
.
.
''
Still
she
had
n't
noticed
anything
.
I
bent
down
,
with
a
brief
grunt
,
and
slipped
off
one
of
my
winter-cracked
black
Bloomingdale
shoes
.
I
held
the
shoe
up
,
before
Joan
's
enlarged
,
pebbly
eyes
,
tilted
it
,
and
watched
her
take
in
the
stream
of
blood
that
cascaded
onto
the
beige
rug
.
``
My
God
!
What
is
it
?
''
``
I
'm
hemorrhaging
.
''
Joan
half
led
,
half
dragged
me
to
the
sofa
and
made
me
lie
down
.
Then
she
propped
some
pillows
under
my
bloodstained
feet
.
Then
she
stood
back
and
demanded
,
``
Who
was
that
man
?
''
For
one
crazy
minute
I
thought
Joan
would
refuse
to
call
a
doctor
until
I
confessed
the
whole
story
of
my
evening
with
Irwin
and
that
after
my
confession
she
would
still
refuse
,
as
a
sort
of
punishment
.
But
then
I
realized
that
she
honestly
took
my
explanation
at
face
value
,
that
my
going
to
bed
with
Irwin
was
utterly
incomprehensible
to
her
,
and
his
appearance
a
mere
prick
to
her
pleasure
at
my
arrival
.
``
Oh
somebody
,
''
I
said
,
with
a
flabby
gesture
of
dismissal
.
Another
pulse
of
blood
released
itself
and
I
contracted
my
stomach
muscles
in
alarm
.
``
Get
a
towel
.
''
Joan
went
out
and
came
back
almost
immediately
with
a
pile
of
towels
and
sheets
.
Like
a
prompt
nurse
,
she
peeled
back
my
blood-wet
clothes
,
drew
a
quick
breath
as
she
arrived
at
the
original
royal
red
towel
,
and
applied
a
fresh
bandage
.
I
lay
,
trying
to
slow
the
beating
of
my
heart
,
as
every
beat
pushed
forth
another
gush
of
blood
.
I
remembered
a
worrisome
course
in
the
Victorian
novel
where
woman
after
woman
died
,
palely
and
nobly
,
in
torrents
of
blood
,
after
a
difficult
childbirth
.
Perhaps
Irwin
had
injured
me
in
some
awful
,
obscure
way
,
and
all
the
while
I
lay
there
on
Joan
's
sofa
I
was
really
dying
.
Joan
pulled
up
an
Indian
hassock
and
began
to
dial
down
the
long
list
of
Cambridge
doctors
.
The
first
number
did
n't
answer
.
Joan
began
to
explain
my
case
to
the
second
number
,
which
did
answer
,
but
then
broke
off
and
said
``
I
see
''
and
hung
up
.
``
What
's
the
trouble
?
''
``
He
'll
only
come
for
regular
customers
or
emergencies
.
It
's
Sunday
.
''
I
tried
to
lift
my
arm
and
look
at
my
watch
,
but
my
hand
was
a
rock
at
my
side
and
would
n't
budge
.
Sunday
--
the
doctor
's
paradise
!
Doctors
at
country
clubs
,
doctors
at
the
seaside
,
doctors
with
mistresses
,
doctors
with
wives
,
doctors
in
church
,
doctors
in
yachts
,
doctors
everywhere
resolutely
being
people
,
not
doctors
.
``
For
God
's
sake
,
''
I
said
,
``
tell
them
I
'm
an
emergency
.
''
The
third
number
did
n't
answer
and
,
at
the
fourth
,
the
party
hung
up
the
minute
Joan
mentioned
it
was
about
a
period
.
Joan
began
to
cry
.
``
Look
,
Joan
,
''
I
said
painstakingly
,
``
call
up
the
local
hospital
.
Tell
them
it
's
an
emergency
.
They
'll
have
to
take
me
.
''
Joan
brightened
and
dialed
a
fifth
number
.
The
Emergency
Service
promised
her
a
staff
doctor
would
attend
to
me
if
I
could
come
in
to
the
ward
.
Then
Joan
called
a
taxi
.
Joan
insisted
on
riding
with
me
.
I
clasped
my
fresh
padding
of
towels
with
a
sort
of
desperation
as
the
cabby
,
impressed
by
the
address
Joan
gave
him
,
cut
corner
after
corner
in
the
dawn-pale
streets
and
drew
up
with
a
great
squeal
of
tires
at
the
Emergency
Ward
entrance
.
I
left
Joan
to
pay
the
driver
and
hurried
into
the
empty
,
glaringly
lit
room
.
A
nurse
bustled
out
from
behind
a
white
screen
.
In
a
few
swift
words
,
I
managed
to
tell
her
the
truth
about
my
predicament
before
Joan
came
in
the
door
,
blinking
and
wide-eyed
as
a
myopic
owl
The
Emergency
Ward
doctor
strolled
out
then
,
and
I
climbed
,
with
the
nurse
's
help
,
on
to
the
examining
table
.
The
nurse
whispered
to
the
doctor
,
and
the
doctor
nodded
and
began
unpacking
the
bloody
toweling
.
I
felt
his
fingers
start
to
probe
,
and
Joan
stood
,
rigid
as
a
soldier
,
at
my
side
,
holding
my
hand
,
for
my
sake
or
hers
I
could
n't
tell
.
``
Ouch
!
''
I
winced
at
a
particularly
bad
jab
.
The
doctor
whistled
.
``
You
're
one
in
a
million
.
''
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
``
I
mean
it
's
one
in
a
million
it
happens
to
like
this
.
''
The
doctor
spoke
in
a
low
,
curt
voice
to
the
nurse
,
and
she
hurried
to
a
side
table
and
brought
back
some
rolls
of
gauze
and
silver
instruments
.
``
I
can
see
,
''
the
doctor
bent
down
,
``
exactly
where
the
trouble
is
coming
from
.
''
``
But
can
you
fix
it
?
''
The
doctor
laughed
.
``
Oh
,
I
can
fix
it
,
all
right
.
''
I
was
roused
by
a
tap
on
my
door
.
It
was
past
midnight
,
and
the
asylum
quiet
as
death
.
I
could
n't
imagine
who
would
still
be
up
.
``
Come
in
!
''
I
switched
on
the
bedside
light
.
The
door
clicked
open
,
and
Doctor
Quinn
's
brisk
,
dark
head
appeared
in
the
crack
.
I
looked
at
her
with
surprise
,
because
although
I
knew
who
she
was
,
and
often
passed
her
,
with
a
brief
nod
,
in
the
asylum
hall
,
I
never
spoke
to
her
at
all
.
Now
she
said
,
``
Miss
Greenwood
,
may
I
come
in
a
minute
?
''
I
nodded
.
Doctor
Quinn
stepped
into
the
room
,
shutting
the
door
quietly
behind
her
.
She
was
wearing
one
of
her
navy
blue
,
immaculate
suits
with
a
plain
,
snow-white
blouse
showing
in
the
V
of
the
neck
.
``
I
'm
sorry
to
bother
you
,
Miss
Greenwood
,
and
especially
at
this
time
of
night
,
but
I
thought
you
might
be
able
to
help
us
out
about
Joan
.
''
For
a
minute
I
wondered
if
Doctor
Quinn
was
going
to
blame
me
for
Joan
's
return
to
the
asylum
.
I
still
was
n't
sure
how
much
Joan
knew
,
after
our
trip
to
the
Emergency
Ward
,
but
a
few
days
later
she
had
come
back
to
live
in
Belsize
,
retaining
,
however
,
the
freest
of
town
privileges
.
``
I
'll
do
what
I
can
,
''
I
told
Doctor
Quinn
.
Doctor
Quinn
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
with
a
grave
face
.
``
We
would
like
to
find
out
where
Joan
is
.
We
thought
you
might
have
an
idea
.
''
Suddenly
I
wanted
to
dissociate
myself
from
Joan
completely
.
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
I
said
coldly
.
``
Is
n't
she
in
her
room
?
''
It
was
well
after
the
Belsize
curfew
hour
.
``
No
,
Joan
had
a
permit
to
go
to
a
movie
in
town
this
evening
,
and
she
's
not
back
yet
.
''
``
Who
was
she
with
?
''
``
She
was
alone
.
''
Doctor
Quinn
paused
.
``
Have
you
any
idea
where
she
might
be
likely
to
spend
the
night
?
''
``
Surely
she
'll
be
back
.
Something
must
have
held
her
up
.
''
But
I
did
n't
see
what
could
have
held
Joan
up
in
tame
night
Boston
.
Doctor
Quinn
shook
her
head
.
``
The
last
trolley
went
by
an
hour
ago
.
''
``
Maybe
she
'll
come
back
by
taxi
.
''
Doctor
Quinn
sighed
.
``
Have
you
tried
the
Kennedy
girl
?
''
I
went
on
.
``
Where
Joan
used
to
live
?
''
Doctor
Quinn
nodded
.
``
Her
family
?
''
``
Oh
,
she
'd
never
go
there
.
.
.
but
we
've
tried
them
,
too
.
''
Doctor
Quinn
lingered
a
minute
,
as
if
she
could
sniff
out
some
clue
in
the
still
room
.
Then
she
said
,
``
Well
,
we
'll
do
what
we
can
,
''
and
left
.
I
turned
out
the
light
and
tried
to
drop
back
to
sleep
,
but
Joan
's
face
floated
before
me
,
bodiless
and
smiling
,
like
the
face
of
the
Cheshire
cat
.
I
even
thought
I
heard
her
voice
,
rustling
and
hushing
through
the
dark
,
but
then
I
realized
it
was
only
the
night
wind
in
the
asylum
trees
.
.
.
Another
tap
woke
me
in
the
frost-gray
dawn
.
This
time
I
opened
the
door
myself
.
Facing
me
was
Doctor
Quinn
.
She
stood
at
attention
,
like
a
frail
drill
sergeant
,
but
her
outlines
seemed
curiously
smudged
.
``
I
thought
you
should
know
,
''
Doctor
Quinn
said
.
``
Joan
has
been
found
.
''
Doctor
Quinn
's
use
of
the
passive
slowed
my
blood
.
``
Where
?
''
``
In
the
woods
,
by
the
frozen
ponds
.
.
.
''
I
opened
my
mouth
,
but
no
words
came
out
.
``
One
of
the
orderlies
found
her
,
''
Doctor
Quinn
continued
,
``
just
now
,
coming
to
work
.
.
.
''
``
She
's
not
.
.
.
''
``
Dead
,
''
said
Doctor
Quinn
.
``
I
'm
afraid
she
's
hanged
herself
.
''
Twenty
A
FRESH
FALL
OF
SNOW
blanketed
the
asylum
grounds
--
not
a
Christmas
sprinkle
,
but
a
man-high
January
deluge
,
the
sort
that
snuffs
out
schools
and
offices
and
churches
,
and
leaves
,
for
a
day
or
more
,
a
pure
,
blank
sheet
in
place
of
memo
pads
,
date
books
and
calendars
.
In
a
week
,
if
I
passed
my
interview
with
the
board
of
directors
,
Philomena
Guinea
's
large
black
car
would
drive
me
west
and
deposit
me
at
the
wrought-iron
gates
of
my
college
.
The
heart
of
winter
!
Massachusetts
would
be
sunk
in
a
marble
calm
.
I
pictured
the
snowflaky
,
Grandma
Moses
villages
,
the
reaches
of
swampland
rattling
with
dried
cattails
,
the
ponds
where
frog
and
hornpout
dreamed
in
a
sheath
of
ice
,
and
the
shivering
woods
.
But
under
the
deceptively
clean
and
level
slate
the
topography
was
the
same
,
and
instead
of
San
Francisco
or
Europe
or
Mars
I
would
be
learning
the
old
landscape
,
brook
and
hill
and
tree
.
In
one
way
it
seemed
a
small
thing
,
starting
,
after
a
six
months
'
lapse
,
where
I
had
so
vehemently
left
off
.
Everybody
would
know
about
me
,
of
course
.
Doctor
Nolan
had
said
,
quite
bluntly
,
that
a
lot
of
people
would
treat
me
gingerly
,
or
even
avoid
me
,
like
a
leper
with
a
warning
bell
.
My
mother
's
face
floated
to
mind
,
a
pale
,
reproachful
moon
,
at
her
last
and
first
visit
to
the
asylum
since
my
twentieth
birthday
.
A
daughter
in
an
asylum
!
I
had
done
that
to
her
.
Still
,
she
had
obviously
decided
to
forgive
me
.
``
We
'll
take
up
where
we
left
off
,
Esther
,
''
she
had
said
,
with
her
sweet
,
martyr
's
smile
.
``
Well
act
as
if
all
this
were
a
bad
dream
.
''
A
bad
dream
.
To
the
person
in
the
bell
jar
,
blank
and
stopped
as
a
dead
baby
,
the
world
itself
is
the
bad
dream
.
A
bad
dream
.
I
remembered
everything
.
I
remembered
the
cadavers
and
Doreen
and
the
story
of
the
fig
tree
and
Marco
's
diamond
and
the
sailor
on
the
Common
and
Doctor
Gordon
's
wall-eyed
nurse
and
the
broken
thermometers
and
the
Negro
with
his
two
kinds
of
beans
and
the
twenty
pounds
I
gained
on
insulin
and
the
rock
that
bulged
between
sky
and
sea
like
a
gray
skull
.
Maybe
forgetfulness
,
like
a
kind
of
snow
,
should
numb
and
cover
them
.
But
they
were
part
of
me
.
They
were
my
landscape
.
``
A
man
to
see
you
!
''
The
smiling
,
snow-capped
nurse
poked
her
head
in
through
the
door
,
and
for
a
confused
second
I
thought
I
really
was
back
in
college
and
this
spruce
white
furniture
,
this
white
view
over
trees
and
hills
,
an
improvement
on
my
old
room
's
nicked
chairs
and
desk
and
outlook
over
the
bald
quad
.
``
A
man
to
see
you
!
''
the
girl
on
watch
had
said
,
on
the
dormitory
phone
.
What
was
there
about
us
,
in
Belsize
,
so
different
from
the
girls
playing
bridge
and
gossiping
and
studying
in
the
college
to
which
I
would
return
?
Those
girls
,
too
,
sat
under
bell
jars
of
a
sort
.
``
Come
in
!
''
I
called
,
and
Buddy
Willard
,
khaki
cap
in
hand
,
stepped
into
the
room
.
``
Well
,
Buddy
,
''
I
said
.
``
Well
,
Esther
.
''
We
stood
there
,
looking
at
each
other
.
I
waited
for
a
touch
of
emotion
,
the
faintest
glow
.
Nothing
.
Nothing
but
a
great
,
amiable
boredom
.
Buddy
's
khaki-jacketed
shape
seemed
small
and
unrelated
to
me
as
the
brown
posts
he
had
stood
against
that
day
a
year
ago
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
ski
run
.
``
How
did
you
get
here
?
''
I
asked
finally
.
``
Mother
's
car
.
''
``
In
all
this
snow
?
''
``
Well
,
''
Buddy
grinned
,
``
I
'm
stuck
outside
in
a
drift
.
The
hill
was
too
much
for
me
.
Is
there
anyplace
I
can
borrow
a
shovel
?
''
``
We
can
get
a
shovel
from
one
of
the
groundsmen
.
''
``
Good
.
''
Buddy
turned
to
go
.
``
Wait
,
I
'll
come
and
help
you
.
''
Buddy
looked
at
me
then
,
and
in
his
eyes
I
saw
a
flicker
of
strangeness
--
the
same
compound
of
curiosity
and
wariness
I
had
seen
in
the
eyes
of
the
Christian
Scientist
and
my
old
English
teacher
and
the
Unitarian
minister
who
used
to
visit
me
.
``
Oh
,
Buddy
,
''
I
laughed
.
``
I
'm
all
right
.
''
``
Oh
,
I
know
,
I
know
,
Esther
,
''
Buddy
said
hastily
.
``
It
's
you
who
ought
n't
to
dig
out
cars
,
Buddy
.
Not
me
.
''
And
Buddy
did
let
me
do
most
of
the
work
.
The
car
had
skidded
on
the
glassy
hill
up
to
the
asylum
and
backed
,
with
one
wheel
over
the
rim
of
the
drive
,
into
a
steep
drift
.
The
sun
,
emerged
from
its
gray
shrouds
of
clouds
,
shone
with
a
summer
brillance
on
the
untouched
slopes
.
Pausing
in
my
work
to
overlook
that
pristine
expanse
,
I
felt
the
same
profound
thrill
it
gives
me
to
see
trees
and
grassland
waist-high
under
flood
water
--
as
if
the
usual
order
of
the
world
had
shifted
slightly
,
and
entered
a
new
phase
.
I
was
grateful
for
the
car
and
the
snowdrift
.
It
kept
Buddy
from
asking
me
what
I
knew
he
was
going
to
ask
,
and
what
he
finally
did
ask
,
in
a
low
,
nervous
voice
,
at
the
Belsize
afternoon
tea
.
DeeDee
was
eyeing
us
like
an
envious
cat
over
the
rim
of
her
teacup
.
After
Joan
's
death
,
DeeDee
had
been
moved
to
Wymark
for
a
while
,
but
now
she
was
among
us
once
more
.
``
I
've
been
wondering
.
.
.
''
Buddy
set
his
cup
in
the
saucer
with
an
awkward
clatter
.
``
What
have
you
been
wondering
?
''
``
I
've
been
wondering
.
.
.
I
mean
,
I
thought
you
might
be
able
to
tell
me
something
.
''
Buddy
met
my
eyes
and
I
saw
,
for
the
first
time
,
how
he
had
changed
.
Instead
of
the
old
,
sure
smile
that
flashed
on
easily
and
frequently
as
a
photographer
's
bulb
,
his
face
was
grave
,
even
tentative
--
the
face
of
a
man
who
often
does
not
get
what
he
wants
.
``
I
'll
tell
you
if
I
can
,
Buddy
.
''
``
Do
you
think
there
's
something
in
me
that
drives
women
crazy
?
''
I
could
n't
help
myself
,
I
burst
out
laughing
--
maybe
because
of
the
seriousness
of
Buddy
's
face
and
the
common
meaning
of
the
word
``
crazy
''
in
a
sentence
like
that
.
``
I
mean
,
''
Buddy
pushed
on
,
``
I
dated
Joan
,
and
then
you
,
and
first
you
.
.
.
went
,
and
then
Joan
.
.
.
''
With
one
finger
I
nudged
a
cake
crumb
into
a
drop
of
wet
,
brown
tea
.
``
Of
course
you
did
n't
do
it
!
''
I
heard
Doctor
Nolan
say
.
I
had
come
to
her
about
Joan
,
and
it
was
the
only
time
I
remember
her
sounding
angry
.
``
Nobody
did
it
.
She
did
it
.
''
And
then
Doctor
Nolan
told
me
how
the
best
of
psychiatrists
have
suicides
among
their
patients
,
and
how
they
,
if
anybody
,
should
be
held
responsible
,
but
how
they
,
on
the
contrary
,
do
not
hold
themselves
responsible
.
.
.
``
You
had
nothing
to
do
with
us
,
Buddy
.
''
``
You
're
sure
?
''
``
Absolutely
.
''
``
Well
,
''
Buddy
breathed
.
``
I
'm
glad
of
that
.
''
And
he
drained
his
tea
like
a
tonic
medicine
.
``
I
hear
you
're
leaving
us
.
''
I
fell
into
step
beside
Valerie
in
the
little
,
nurse-supervised
group
.
``
Only
if
the
doctors
say
yes
.
I
have
my
interview
tomorrow
.
''
The
packed
snow
creaked
underfoot
,
and
everywhere
I
could
hear
a
musical
trickle
and
drip
as
the
noon
sun
thawed
icicles
and
snow
crusts
that
would
glaze
again
before
nightfall
.
The
shadows
of
the
massed
black
pines
were
lavender
in
that
bright
light
,
and
I
walked
with
Valerie
awhile
,
down
the
familiar
labyrinth
of
shoveled
asylum
paths
.
Doctors
and
nurses
and
patients
passing
on
adjoining
paths
seemed
to
be
moving
on
casters
,
cut
off
at
the
waist
by
the
piled
snow
.
``
Interviews
!
''
Valerie
snorted
.
``
They
're
nothing
!
If
they
're
going
to
let
you
out
,
they
let
you
out
.
''
``
I
hope
so
.
''
In
front
of
Caplan
I
said
good-bye
to
Valerie
's
calm
,
snow-maiden
face
behind
which
so
little
,
bad
or
good
,
could
happen
,
and
walked
on
alone
,
my
breath
coming
in
white
puffs
even
in
that
sun-filled
air
.
Valerie
's
last
,
cheerful
cry
had
been
``
So
long
!
Be
seeing
you
.
''
``
Not
if
I
know
it
,
''
I
thought
.
But
I
was
n't
sure
.
I
was
n't
sure
at
all
.
How
did
I
know
that
someday
--
at
college
,
in
Europe
,
somewhere
,
anywhere
--
the
bell
jar
,
with
its
stifling
distortions
,
would
n't
descend
again
?
And
had
n't
Buddy
said
,
as
if
to
revenge
himself
for
my
digging
out
the
car
and
his
having
to
stand
by
,
``
I
wonder
who
you
'll
marry
now
,
Esther
.
''
``
What
?
''
I
'd
said
,
shoveling
snow
up
onto
a
mound
and
blinking
against
the
stinging
backshower
of
loose
flakes
.
``
I
wonder
who
you
'll
marry
now
,
Esther
.
Now
you
've
been
,
''
and
Buddy
's
gesture
encompassed
the
hill
,
the
pines
and
the
severe
,
snow-gabled
buidlings
breaking
up
the
rolling
landscape
,
``
here
.
''
And
of
course
I
did
n't
know
who
would
marry
me
now
that
I
'd
been
where
I
had
been
.
I
did
n't
know
at
all
.
``
I
have
a
bill
here
,
Irwin
.
''
I
spoke
quietly
into
the
mouthpiece
of
the
asylum
pay
phone
in
the
main
hall
of
the
administration
building
.
At
first
I
suspected
the
operator
,
at
her
switchboard
,
might
be
listening
,
but
she
just
went
on
plugging
and
unplugging
her
little
tubes
without
batting
an
eye
.
``
Yes
,
''
Irwin
said
.
``
It
's
a
bill
for
twenty
dollars
for
emergency
attention
on
a
certain
date
in
December
and
a
checkup
a
week
thereafter
.
''
``
Yes
,
''
Irwin
said
.
``
The
hospital
says
they
are
sending
me
the
bill
because
there
was
no
answer
to
the
bill
they
sent
to
you
.
''
``
All
right
,
all
right
,
I
'm
writing
a
check
now
.
I
'm
writing
them
a
blank
check
.
''
Irwin
's
voice
altered
subtly
.
``
When
am
I
going
to
see
you
?
''
``
Do
you
really
want
to
know
?
''
``
Very
much
.
''
``
Never
,
''
I
said
,
and
hung
up
with
a
resolute
click
.
I
wondered
,
briefly
,
if
Irwin
would
send
his
check
to
the
hospital
after
that
,
and
then
I
thought
,
``
Of
course
he
will
,
he
's
a
mathematics
professor
--
he
wo
n't
want
to
leave
any
loose
ends
.
''
I
felt
unaccountably
weak-kneed
and
relieved
.
Irwin
's
voice
had
meant
nothing
to
me
.
This
was
the
first
time
,
since
our
first
and
last
meeting
,
that
I
had
spoken
with
him
and
,
I
was
reasonably
sure
,
it
would
be
the
last
.
Irwin
had
absolutely
no
way
of
getting
in
touch
with
me
,
except
by
going
to
Nurse
Kennedy
's
flat
,
and
after
Joan
's
death
Nurse
Kennedy
had
moved
somewhere
else
and
left
no
trace
.
I
was
perfectly
free
.
Joan
's
parents
invited
me
to
the
funeral
.
I
had
been
,
Mrs.
Gilling
said
,
one
of
Joan
's
best
friends
.
``
You
do
n't
have
to
go
,
you
know
,
''
Doctor
Nolan
told
me
.
``
You
can
always
write
and
say
I
said
it
would
be
better
not
to
.
''
``
I
'll
go
,
''
I
said
,
and
I
did
go
,
and
all
during
the
simple
funeral
service
I
wondered
what
I
thought
I
was
burying
.
At
the
altar
the
coffin
loomed
in
its
snow
pallor
of
flowers
--
the
black
shadow
of
something
that
was
n't
there
.
The
faces
in
the
pews
around
me
were
waxen
with
candlelight
,
and
pine
boughs
,
left
over
from
Christmas
,
sent
up
a
sepulchral
incense
in
the
cold
air
.
Beside
me
,
Jody
's
cheeks
bloomed
like
good
apples
,
and
here
and
there
in
the
little
congregation
I
recognized
other
faces
of
other
girls
from
college
and
my
home
town
who
had
known
Joan
.
DeeDee
and
Nurse
Kennedy
bent
their
kerchiefed
heads
in
a
front
pew
.
Then
,
behind
the
coffin
and
the
flowers
and
the
face
of
the
minister
and
the
faces
of
the
mourners
,
I
saw
the
rolling
lawns
of
our
town
cemetery
,
knee-deep
in
snow
now
,
with
the
tombstones
rising
out
of
it
like
smokeless
chimneys
.
There
would
be
a
black
,
six-foot-deep
gap
hacked
in
the
hard
ground
.
That
shadow
would
marry
this
shadow
,
and
the
peculiar
,
yellowish
soil
of
our
locality
seal
the
wound
in
the
whiteness
,
and
yet
another
snowfall
erase
the
traces
of
newness
in
Joan
's
grave
.
I
took
a
deep
breath
and
listened
to
the
old
brag
of
my
heart
.
I
am
,
I
am
,
I
am
.
The
doctors
were
having
their
weekly
board
meeting
--
old
business
,
new
business
,
admissions
,
dismissals
and
interviews
.
Leafing
blindly
through
a
tatty
National
Geographic
in
the
asylum
library
,
I
waited
my
turn
.
Patients
,
with
accompanying
nurses
,
made
their
rounds
of
the
stocked
shelves
,
conversing
in
low
tones
,
with
the
asylum
librarian
,
an
alumna
of
the
asylum
herself
.
Glancing
at
her
--
myopic
,
spinsterish
,
effaced
--
I
wondered
how
she
knew
she
had
graduated
at
all
,
and
,
unlike
her
clients
,
was
whole
and
well
.
``
Do
n't
be
scared
,
''
Doctor
Nolan
had
said
.
``
I
'll
be
there
,
and
the
rest
of
the
doctors
you
know
,
and
some
visitors
,
and
Doctor
Vining
,
the
head
of
all
the
doctors
,
will
ask
you
a
few
questions
,
and
then
you
can
go
.
''
But
in
spite
of
Doctor
Nolan
's
reassurances
,
I
was
scared
to
death
.
I
had
hoped
,
at
my
departure
,
I
would
feel
sure
and
knowledgeable
about
everything
that
lay
ahead
--
after
all
,
I
had
been
``
analyzed
.
''
Instead
,
all
I
could
see
were
question
marks
.
I
kept
shooting
impatient
glances
at
the
closed
boardroom
door
.
My
stocking
seams
were
straight
,
my
black
shoes
cracked
,
but
polished
,
and
my
red
wool
suit
flamboyant
as
my
plans
.
Something
old
,
something
new
.
.
.
But
I
was
n't
getting
married
.
There
ought
,
I
thought
,
to
be
a
ritual
for
being
born
twice
--
patched
,
retreaded
and
approved
for
the
road
,
I
was
trying
to
think
of
an
appropriate
one
when
Doctor
Nolan
appeared
from
nowhere
and
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
.
``
All
right
,
Esther
.
''
I
rose
and
followed
her
to
the
open
door
.
Pausing
,
for
a
brief
breath
,
on
the
threshold
,
I
saw
the
silver-haired
doctor
who
had
told
me
about
the
rivers
and
the
Pilgrims
on
my
first
day
,
and
the
pocked
,
cadaverous
face
of
Miss
Huey
,
and
eyes
I
thought
I
had
recognized
over
white
masks
.
The
eyes
and
the
faces
all
turned
themselves
toward
me
,
and
guiding
myself
by
them
,
as
by
a
magical
thread
,
I
stepped
into
the
room
.
Sylvia
Plath
:
A
Biographical
Note
by
Lois
Ames
With
eight
previously
unpublished
drawings
by
Sylvia
Plath
THE
Bell
JAR
was
first
published
in
London
in
January
1963
by
William
Heinemann
Limited
,
under
the
pseudonym
Victoria
Lucas
.
Sylvia
Plath
had
adopted
the
pen
name
for
publication
of
her
first
novel
because
she
questioned
its
literary
value
and
did
not
believe
it
was
a
``
serious
work
''
;
she
was
also
worried
about
the
pain
publication
might
cause
to
the
many
people
close
to
her
whose
personalities
she
had
distorted
and
lightly
disguised
in
the
book
.
The
central
themes
of
Sylvia
Plath
's
early
life
are
the
basis
for
The
Bell
Jar
.
She
was
born
in
1932
in
Massachusetts
and
spent
her
early
childhood
years
in
Winthrop
,
a
seaside
town
close
to
Boston
.
Her
mother
's
parents
were
Austrian
;
her
father
,
a
distinguished
professor
of
biology
at
Boston
University
(
and
an
internationally
known
authority
on
bees
)
,
had
emigrated
to
the
States
from
Poland
as
an
adolescent
;
she
had
one
brother
,
two
and
a
half
years
younger
.
A
radical
change
occurred
in
Sylvia
's
life
when
she
was
eight
:
in
November
1940
,
her
father
died
after
a
long
,
difficult
illness
,
and
the
mother
and
grandparents
moved
the
family
inland
to
the
town
of
Wellesley
,
a
conservative
upper-middle-class
suburb
of
Boston
.
While
the
grandmother
assumed
the
care
of
the
household
,
Mrs.
Plath
taught
students
in
the
medical-secretarial
training
program
at
Boston
University
,
commuting
each
day
,
and
the
grandfather
worked
as
maître
d'hôtel
at
the
Brookline
Country
Club
,
where
he
lived
during
the
week
.
Sylvia
and
her
brother
attended
the
local
public
schools
.
``
I
went
to
public
schools
,
''
she
wrote
later
,
``
genuinely
public
.
Everyone
went
.
''
At
an
early
age
she
began
to
write
poems
and
to
draw
in
pen
and
ink
--
and
to
collect
prizes
with
her
first
publication
of
each
.
By
the
time
she
was
seventeen
,
her
interest
in
writing
had
become
disciplined
and

Publication
,
however
,
did
not
come
easily
;
she
had
submitted
forty-five
pieces
to
the
magazine
Seventeen
before
her
first
short
story
,
``
And
Summer
Will
Not
Come
Again
,
''
was
published
in
the
August
1950
issue
.
A
poem
,
``
Bitter
Strawberries
,
''
a
sardonic
comment
on
war
,
was
accepted
and
published
in
the
same
month
by
the
Christian
Science
Monitor
.
In
her
high
school
year
book
,
The
Wellesleyan
,
the
girl
who
later
described
herself
as
a
``
rabid
teenage
pragmatist
''
was

In
September
1950
,
Sylvia
entered
Smith
College
in
Northampton
,
Massachusetts
,
the
largest
women
's
college
in
the
world
.
She
went
on
scholarship
--
one
from
the
Wellesley
Smith
Club
and
one
endowed
by
Olive
Higgins
Prouty
,
the
novelist
and
author
of
Stella
Dallas
,
later
a
friend
and
patron
.
These
were
the
years
in
which
Sylvia
wrote
poetry
on
a
precise
schedule
,
circled
words
in
the
red-leather
thesaurus
which
had
belonged
to
her
father
,
maintained
a
detailed
journal
,
kept
a
diligent
scrapbook
,
and
studied
with
concentration
.
Highly
successful
as
a
student
,
she
was
also
elected
to
class
and
college
offices
;
she
became
a
member
of
the
editorial
board
of
The
Smith
Review
,
went
for
weekends
to
men
's
colleges
,
and
published
stories
and
poems
in
Seventeen
.
But
at
the
time
she
wrote
in
a
letter
:
``
for
the
few
little
outward
successes
I
may
seem
to
have
,
there
are
acres
of
misgivings
and
self-doubt
.
''
Of
this
period
a
friend
later
said
:
``
It
was
as
if
Sylvia
could
n't
wait
for
life
to
come
to
her
.
.
.
She
rushed
out
to
greet
it
,
to
make
things
happen
.
''
As
she
became
increasingly
conscious
of
herself
as
a
woman
,
the
conflict
between
the
life-style
of
a
poet/intellectual
and
that
of
a
wife
and
mother
became
a
central
preoccupation
,
and
she
wrote
:
``
.
.
.it
's
quite
amazing
how
I
've
gone
around
for
most
of
my
life
as
in
the
rarefied
atmosphere
under
a
bell
jar
.
''
In
August
1951
she
won
Mademoiselle
magazine
's
fiction
contest
with
a
short
story
,
``
Sunday
at
the
Mintons
,
''
and
in
the
following
year
,
her
junior
year
in
college
,
Sylvia
was
awarded
two
Smith
poetry
prizes
and
was
elected
to
Phi
Beta
Kappa
and
to
Alpha
,
the
Smith
College
honorary
society
for
the
arts
.
Then
in
the
summer
of
1952
she
was
chosen
to
be
a
guest
editor
in
Mademoiselle
's
College
Board
Contest
.
In
her
scrapbook
,
she
described
the
beginning
of
that
month
in
New
York
in
the
breathy
style
of
the
magazine
:
After
being
one
of
the
two
national
winners
of
Mademoiselle
's
fiction
contest
(
$
500
!
)
last
August
,
I
felt
that
I
was
coming
home
again
when
I
won
a
guest
editorship
representing
Smith
&
took
a
train
to
NYC
for
a
salaried
month
working
--
hatted
&

--
in
Mlle
's
airconditioned
Madison
Ave.

.
Fantastic
,

,
and
all
other
inadequate
adjectives

to
describe
the
four

,

and

by
a
galaxy
of
UN

,

.
.
an
almost
unbelievable
merry-
go-round
month
--
this

:
Vance
Bourjaily
,
Paul
Engle
,
Elizabeth
Bowen
--
wrote

via
correspondence
with
5
handsome
young
male
poet
teachers
.
The
poets
were
Alistair
Reid
,
Anthony
Hecht
,
Richard
Wilbur
,
George
Steiner
,
and
William
Burford
,
whose
pictures
were
accompanied
by
biographical
notes
and
comments
on
poets
and
poetry
.
After
230-odd
pages
of
advertising
,
the
bulk
of
the
August
1953
college
issue
was
introduced
by
Sylvia
as
Guest
Managing
Editor
with
``
Mlle
's
last
word
on
college
,
'53
.
''
Under
a
vapid
picture
of
the
guest
editors
holding
hands
in
star
formations
,
dressed
alike
in
tartan
skirts
with
matching
Eton
caps
and
open-mouthed
smiles
,
she
wrote
:
We
're

Foremost
in

I
shut
my
eyes
and
all
the
world
drops
dead
;
I
lift
my
lids
and
all
is
born
again
.
(
I
think
I
made
you
up
inside
my
head
.
)
The
stars
go
waltzing
out
in
blue
and
red
,
And
arbitrary
blackness
gallops
in
:
I
shut
my
eyes
and
all
the
world
drops
dead
.
I
dreamed
that
you
bewitched
me
into
bed
And
sung
me
moon-struck
,
kissed
me
quite
insane
.
(
I
think
I
made
you
up
inside
my
head
.
)
God
topples
from
the
sky
,
hell
's
fires
fade
:
Exit
seraphim
and
Satan
's
men
:
I
shut
my
eyes
and
all
the
world
drops
dead
.
I
fancied
you
'd
return
the
way
you
said
,
But
I
grow
old
and
I
forget
your
name
.
(
I
think
I
made
you
up
inside
my
head
.
)
I
should
have
loved
a
thunderbird
instead
;
At
least
when
spring
comes
they
roar
back
again
.
I
shut
my
eyes
and
all
the
world
drops
dead
.
(
I
think
I
made
you
up
inside
my
head
.
)
That
summer
,
too
,
Harper
's
Magazine
paid
$
100
for
three
poems
which
Sylvia
identified
as
``
first
professional
earnings
.
''
Later
,
assessing
these
bubbling
achievements
,
she
wrote
,
``
All
in
all
,
I
felt
upborne
on
a
wave
of
creative
,
social
and
financial
success
--
The
six
month
crash
,
however
,
was
to
come
--
''
These
were
the
events
which
took
place
in
her
life
in
the
summer
and
autumn
of
1953
--
at
the
time
of
the
electrocution
of
the
Rosenbergs
,
at
the
time
when
Senator
Joseph
McCarthy
was
forcing
his
power
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
Eisenhower
presidency
-
-
these
were
the
events
which
Sylvia
Plath
reconstructed
in
The
Bell
Jar
.
Years
later
she
described
the
book
she
wanted
to
write
:
The
pressures
of
the
fashion
magazine
world
which
seems
increasingly
superficial
and
artificial
,
the
return
home
to
the
dead
summer
world
of
a
suburb
of
Boston
.
Here
the
cracks
in
her
[
the
heroine
,
Esther
Greenwood
's
]
nature
which
had
been
held
together
as
it
were
by
the
surrounding
pressures
of
New
York
widen
and
gape
alarmingly
.
More
and
more
her
warped
view
of
the
world
around
--
her
own
vacuous
domestic
life
,
and
that
of
her
neighbors
--
seems
the
one
right
way
of
looking
at
things
.
For
Sylvia
then
came
electroshock
therapy
and
finally
her
well-publicized
disappearance
,
subsequent
discovery
and
consequent
hospitalization
for
psychotherapy
and
more
shock
treatment
.
She
wrote
:
``
A
time
of
darkness
,
despair
,
disillusion
--
so
black
only
as
the
inferno
of
the
human
mind
can
be
--
symbolic
death
,
and
numb
shock
--
then
the
painful
agony
of
slow
rebirth
and
psychic
regeneration
.
''
Subsequently
Sylvia
returned
to
Smith
College
and
reconquered
``
old
broncos
that
threw
me
for
a
loop
last
year
.
''
At
the
beginning
of
the
next
summer
she
wrote
that
``
a
semester
of
reconstruction
ends
with
an
infinitely
more
solid
if
less
flashingly
spectacular
flourish
than
last
year
's
.
''
By
the
end
of
the
next
academic
year
,
she
had
sold
more
poems
,
earned
additional
prizes
,
and
written
her
long
paper
for
English
honors
on
the
double
personality
in
Dostoyevski
's
novels
.
In
June
1955
she
graduated
from
Smith
College
summa
cum
laude
with
the
prospect
of
an
English
Fulbright
year
in
Newnham
College
at
Cambridge
University
.
There
Sylvia
met
the
British
poet
Ted
Hughes
,
whom
she
married
in
London
on
June
16
,
1956
:
Bloomsday
.
Sylvia
's
Fulbright
was
renewed
and
,
after
a
vacation
in
Spain
,
Ted
and
Sylvia
lived
in
Cambridge
for
another
year
.
Then
,
in
the
spring
of
1957
,
they
moved
to
the
United
States
,
where
Sylvia
was
assessed
by
her
colleagues
as
``
one
of
the
two
or
three
finest
instructors
ever
to
appear
in
the
English
department
at
Smith
College
.
''
It
is
probable
that
Sylvia
already
had
a
version
of
The
Bell
Jar
in
her
trunks
when
she
returned
to
the
States
,
but
she
was
concentrating
on
poetry
and
on
teaching
.
In
June
1958
,
she
applied
for
a
Eugene
F.
Saxton
Memorial
Fellowship
to
complete
her
book
of
poems
.
The
Saxton
Fellowship
had
been
established
``
to
honor
an
outstanding
editor
of
Harper
&
Brothers
''
;
the
trust
,
at
the
discretion
of
the
trustees
,
gave
outright
grants
of
money
to
writers
for
living
expenses
.
Agreement
of
all
three
trustees
was
necessary
to
make
the
grant
,
and
one
of
them
,
who
called
the
sample
poems
``
beyond
reproach
,
''
noted
that
``
in
looking
over
Mrs.
Hughes
'
history
,
I
see
that
she
has
had
valuable
awards
dropped
into
her
lap
during
most
of
her
adult
life
.
Perhaps
it
would
not
do
her
any
real
harm
to
continue
her
work
for
a
while
as
a
teacher
in
a
fine
college
.
My
impulse
is
rejection
,
though
I
think
the
quality
of
her
work
entitles
her
to
serious
consideration
.
''
In
October
1958
the
application
was
rejected
with
a
special
letter
from
the
secretary
to
the
trustees
,
who
wanted
Mrs.
Hughes
to
know
that
``
your
application
aroused
more
than
ordinary
interest
.
The
talent
--
which
is
marked
--
was
not
a
matter
for
dispute
but
rather
the
nature
of
the
project
.
''
Meanwhile
the
Hugheses
had
moved
to
a
small
apartment
on
Beacon
Hill
,
``
living
on
a
shoestring
for
a
year
in
Boston
writing
to
see
what
we
could
do
.
''
Sylvia
had
made
the
difficult
decision
to
give
up
teaching
,
and
to
discard
an
academic
plan
for
which
she
had
been
groomed
since
childhood
,
in
exchange
for
a
less
certain
existence
but
one
which
she
hoped
would
give
her
more
time
to
write
.
However
,
as
the
year
progressed
,
and
her
book
of
poems
was
repeatedly
submitted
and
rejected
under
ever-changing
tides
,
she
wrote
:
Nothing
stinks
like
a
pile
of
unpublished
writing
,
which
remark
I
guess
shows
I
still
do
n't
have
a
pure
motive
(
O
it's-such-fun-I-just-can't-stop-who-cares-if-it's-published-or-read
)
about
writing
.
.
.
I
still
want
to
see
it
finally
ritualized
in
print
.
In
December
1959
,
Ted
and
Sylvia
returned
to
England
to
live
.
In
April
1960
their
first
child
,
Freda
,
was
born
.
At
last
Sylvia
's
book
of
poetry
,
The
Colossus
,
was
accepted
for
fall
publication
by
William
Heinemann
Limited
.
Subsequently
Sylvia
suffered
a
miscarriage
,
then
an
appendectomy
,
and
then
became
pregnant
again
.
On
May
1
,
1961
,
she
again
applied
for
a
Eugene
F.
Saxton
Fellowship
;
this
time
in
order
to
finish
a
novel
which
she
described
as
one-sixth
completed
--
about
fifty
pages
.
On
the
application
Sylvia
had
asked
for
money
to
cover
``
babysitter
or
nanny
at
about
$
5
a
day
,
6
days
a
week
for
a
year
,
$
1,560
.
Rent
of
study
at
about
$
10
a
week
:
$
520
for
a
year
.
Total
:
$
2,080
.
.
.
(
At
present
I
am
living
in
a
two
room
flat
with
my
husband
and
year
old
baby
and
having
to
work
part
time
to
meet
living
expenses
.
)
''
To
a
friend
she
wrote
that
she
was
``
over
one
third
through
a
novel
about
a
college
girl
building
up
for
and
going
through
a
nervous
breakdown
.
''
She
wrote
:
I
have
been
wanting
to
do
this
for
ten
years
but
had
a
terrible
block
about
Writing
A
Novel
.
Then
suddenly
in
beginning
negotiations
with
a
New
York
publisher
for
an
American
edition
of
my
poems
,
the
dykes
broke
and
I
stayed
awake
all
night
seized
by
fearsome
excitement
,
saw
how
it
should
be
done
,
started
the
next
day
&
go
every
morning
to
my
borrowed
study
as
to
an
office
&
belt
out
more
of
it
.
In
the
summer
,
the
Hugheses
moved
to
Devon
to
live
in
a
thatch-roofed
country
house
,
and
on
November
6
,
1961
,
the
secretary
to
the
Saxton
trustees
wrote
that
they
had
voted
to
give
her
a
grant
in
the
amount
of
$
2,080
,
``
the
sum
you
suggested
.
''
Sylvia
replied
,
``
I
was
very
happy
to
receive
your
good
letter
today
telling
about
the
Saxton
Fellowship
.
I
certainly
do
plan
to
go
ahead
with
the
novel
and
the
award
comes
at
a
particularly
helpful
time
to
free
me
to
do
so
.
''
On
January
17
,
1962
,
a
son
,
Nicholas
,
was
born
.
The
days
were
divided
among
the
babies
,
housework
,
and
writing
,
but
on
February
10
,
1962
,
Sylvia
punctually
delivered
her
first
quarterly
report
on
the
progress
of
her
novel
to
the
Saxton
trustees
.
``
During
the
past
three
months
the
novel
has
progressed
very
satisfactorily
,
according
to
my
drafted
schedule
.
I
have
worked
through
several
rough
drafts
to
a
final
version
of
Chapters
5
through
8
,
completing
a
total
of
105
pages
of
the
novel
in
all
,
and
have
outlined
in
detail
Chapters
9
through
12
.
''
Then
she
gave
in
detail
the
plans
for
The
Bell
Jar
.
Although
the
novel
was
going
well
,
Sylvia
complained
to
a
friend
that
she
felt
she
was
doing
little
work
:
``
a
couple
of
poems
I
like
a
year
looks
like
a
lot
when
they
come
out
,
but
in
fact
are
points
of
satisfaction
separated
by

On
May
1
,
1962
,
in
the
next
quarterly
report
to
the
Saxton
trustees
,
she
wrote
,
``
The
novel
is
getting
on
very
well
,
and
according
to
schedule
.
I
have
completed
Chapters
9
through
12
(
pages
106-166
)
and
projected
in
detailed
outline
the
next
lap
of
the
book
.
''
By
June
1962
she
could
tell
a
friend
:
``
I
'm
writing
again
.
Really
writing
.
I
'd
like
you
to
see
some
of
my
new
poems
.
''
She
had
begun
the
Ariel
poems
and
was
confident
enough
to
want
to
show
them
,
to
have
them
read
,
to
read
them
aloud
.
These
poems
were
different
:
her
husband
has
written
that
``
Tulips
''
``
was
the
first
sign
of
what
was
on
its
way
.
She
wrote
this
poem
without
her
usual
studies
over
the
Thesaurus
,
and
at
top
speed
,
as
one
might
write
an
urgent
letter
.
From
then
on
,
all
her
poems
were
written
this
way
.
''
On
August
1
,
1962
,
Sylvia
sent
her
final
progress
report
to
the
Saxton
trustees
:
The
novel
is
rounding
out
now
,
shaping
up
pretty
much
as
planned
,
and
I
have
completed
Chapters
13
through
16
(
pages
167-221
)
and
am
hoping
the
last
lap
goes
as
well
.
After
a
vacation
in
Ireland
,
Sylvia
and
Ted
decided
to
separate
for
a
while
.
The
summer
had
been
difficult
.
She
had
suffered
repeated
attacks
of
flu
accompanied
by
high
fever
.
Another
winter
in
Devon
seemed
impossible
.
She
began
to
commute
to
London
,
where
she
was
``
getting
work
with
the
BBC
''
and
hunting
for
a
flat
.
The
manuscript
of
The
Bell
Jar
had
been
sent
to
the
trustees
of
the
Saxton
Fellowship
in
the
States
,
and
Heinemann
had
accepted
the
novel
in
England
and
was
setting
it
into
type
.
A
few
days
before
Christmas
,
Sylvia
moved
herself
and
the
children
to
London
,
where
she
had
signed
a
five-year
lease
on
a
flat
:
.
.
.a
small
miracle
happened
--
I
'd
been
to
Yeats
'
tower
at
Ballylea
while
in
Ireland
&
thought
it
the
most
beautiful
&
peaceful
place
in
the
world
;
then
,
walking
desolately
around
my
beloved
Primrose
Hill
in
London
and
brooding
on
the
hopelessness
of
ever
finding
a
flat
.
.
.
I
passed
Yeats
'
house
,
with
its
blue
plaque
``
Yeats
lived
here
''
which
I
'd
often
passed
&
longed
to
live
in
.
A
sign
board
was
up
--
flats
to
rent
,
I
flew
to
the
agent
.
By
a
miracle
you
can
only
know
if
you
've
ever
tried
to
flat
hunt
in
London
,
I
was
first
to
apply
.
.
.
I
am
here
on
a
five
year
lease
&
it
is
utter
heaven
.
.
.
and
it
's
Yeats
'
house
,
which
right
now
means
a
lot
to
me
.
Sylvia
took
the
finding
of
the
Yeats
house
for
a
sign
.
She
told
a
friend
that
when
she
went
out
to
look
for
flats
that
day
,
she
had
``
known
''
she
would
find
it
,
and
so
,
with
that
confirmation
,
she
began
to
make
plans
with
energetic
assurance
.
She
was
working
on
a
new
novel
,
and
the
Ariel
poems
were
continuing
to
flow
.
She
told
another
friend
that
she
thought
of
The
Bell
Jar
``
as
an
autobiographical
apprentice
work
which
I
had
to
write
in
order
to
free
myself
from
the
past
.
''
But
the
new
novel
,
about
more
recent
events
in
her
life
,
she
regarded
as
strong
,
powerful
and
urgent
.
When
The
Bell
Jar
was
published
,
in
January
1963
,
Sylvia
was
distressed
by
the
reviews
,
although
another
reader
,
not
the
author
and
not
under
the
same
sorts
of
stress
,
might
have
interpreted
the
critics
'
views
of
the
novel
far
differently
.
Lawrence
Lerner
in
the
Listener
wrote
,
``
There
are
criticisms
of
America
that
the
neurotic
can
make
as
well
as
anyone
,
perhaps
better
,
and
Miss
Lucas
makes
them
brilliantly
.
''
The
Times
Literary
Supplement
observed
that
the
author
``
can
certainly
write
,
''
and
went
on
to
say
that
``
if
she
can
learn
to
shape
as
well
as
she
imagines
,
she
may
write
an
extremely
good
book
.
''
In
the
New
Statesman
,
Robert
Taubman
called
The
Bell
Jar
``
the
first
feminine
novel
in
a
Salinger
mood
.
''
In
1970
,
Aurelia
Plath
,
her
mother
,
wrote
a
letter
to
Sylvia
's
editor
at
Harper
&
Row
in
New
York
about
the
anticipated
publication
of
the
first
American
edition
of
The
Bell
Jar
:
I
realize
that
no
explanation
of
the
why
of
personal
suffering
that
this
publication
here
[
publication
of
The
Bell
Jar
in
the
United
States
]
will
create
in
the
lives
of
several
people
nor
any
appeal
on
any
other
grounds
is
going
to
stop
this
,
so
I
shall
waste
neither
my
time
nor
yours
in
pointing
out
the
inevitable
repercussions
.
.
.
I
do
want
to
tell
you
of
one
of
the
last
conversations
I
had
with
my
daughter
in
early
July
,
1962
,
just
before
her
personal
world
fell
apart
.
Sylvia
had
told
me
of
the
pressure
she
was
under
in
fulfilling
her
obligation
to
the
Eugene
Saxton
Fund
.
As
you
know
,
she
had
been
given
a
grant
by
this
fund
to
enable
her
to
write
a
novel
.
In
the
space
of
time
allotted
,
she
had
a
miscarriage
,
an
appendectomy
,
and
had
given
birth
to
her
second
child
,
Nicholas
.
``
What
I
've
done
,
''
I
remember
her
saying
,
``
is
to
throw
together
events
from
my
own
life
,
fictionalizing
to
add
color
--
it
's
a
pot
boiler
really
,
but
I
think
it
will
show
how
isolated
a
person
feels
when
he
is
suffering
a
breakdown
.
.
.
I
've
tried
to
picture
my
world
and
the
people
in
it
as
seen
through
the
distorting
lens
of
a
bell
jar
.
''
Then
she
went
on
to
say
,
``
My
second
book
will
show
that
same
world
as
seen
through
the
eyes
of
health
.
''
Practically
every
character
in
The
Bell
Jar
represents
someone
--
often
in
caricature
--
whom
Sylvia
loved
;
each
person
had
given
freely
of
time
,
thought
,
affection
,
and
,
in
one
case
,
financial
help
during
those
agonizing
six
months
of
breakdown
in
1953.
.
.
as
this
book
stands
by
itself
,
it
represents
the
basest
ingratitude
.
That
was
not
the
basis
of
Sylvia
's
personality
;
it
was
the
reason
she
became
so
frightened
when
,
at
the
time
of
publication
,
the
book
was
widely
read
and
showed
signs
of
becoming
a
success
.
Sylvia
wrote
her
brother
that
``
this
must
never
be
published
in
the
United
States
.
''
The
very
title
The
Bell
Jar
should
imply
what
Sylvia
told
me
and
that
is
what
the
astute
reader
should
infer
.
.
.
It
was
the
coldest
winter
in
London
since
1813-14
.
Light
and
heat
went
off
at
unannounced
intervals
.
Pipes
froze
.
She
had
applied
,
and
her
name
was
on
the
list
,
but
a
telephone
had
not
yet
been
installed
.
Each
morning
before
the
children
woke
at
eight
,
Sylvia
worked
on
the
Ariel
poems
.
Here
the
sense
of
human
experience
as
horrid
and
ungovernable
,
the
sense
of
all
relationships
as
puppetlike
and
meaningless
,
had
come
to
dominate
her
imagination
.
Yet
she
wrote
with
intensity
,
convinced
that
what
she
was
now
writing
could
be
said
by
no
one
else
.
Always
there
was
the
need
to
be
practical
,
to
find
time
for
the
deliberate
expression
of
anguish
.
Sylvia
wrote
,
``
I
feel
like
a
very
efficient
tool
or
weapon
,
used
and
in
demand
from
moment
to
moment
.
.
.
''
She
had
seen
a
doctor
who
had
prescribed
sedatives
and
had
arranged
for
her
to
consult
a
psychotherapist
.
She
wrote
for
an
appointment
and
had
also
written
to
her
former
psychiatrist
in
Boston
.
A
recurrent
problem
of
sinus
infection
developed
.
She
had
fired
her
au
pair
girl
and
was
waiting
for
a
replacement
``
to
help
with
the
babes
mornings
so
I
can
write
.
.
.
nights
are
no
good
,
I
'm
so
flat
by
then
that
all
I
can
cope
with
is
music
&
brandy
&
water
.
''
In
spite
of
the
help
of
friends
and
anticipation
of
spring
(
she
was
to
return
to
the
house
in
Devon
around
May
Day
)
,
she
was
despairing
and
ill
.
But
the
poems
continued
to
come
,
even
in
the
last
week
of
her
life
--
several
extraordinary
poems
.
To
those
around
her
it
appeared
that
she
had
not
given
up
.
Frequently
she
seemed
bright
,
cheerful
,
full
of
hope
.
However
,
on
the
morning
of
February
11
,
1963
,
she
ended
her
life
.
Who
can
explain
why
?
As
Sylvia
had
written
earlier
in
the
last
optimistic
pages
of
The
Bell
Jar
:
How
did
I
know
that
someday
--
at
college
,
in
Europe
,
somewhere
,
anywhere
--
the
bell
jar
,
with
its
stifling
distortions
,
would
n't
descend
again
?
--
that
bell
jar
out
of
which
she
had
once
straggled
brilliantly
,
successfully
,
apparently
completely
,
but
of
which
she
could
write
with
the
clarity
of
one
who
has
endured
:
``
to
the
person
in
The
Bell
Jar
,
black
and
stopped
as
a
dead
baby
,
the
world
itself
is
a
bad
dream
.
''
On
the
pleasant
shore
of
the
French
Riviera
,
about
half
way
between
Marseilles
and
the
Italian
border
,
stands
a
large
,
proud
,
rose-colored
hotel
.
Deferential
palms
cool
its
flushed
façade
,
and
before
it
stretches
a
short
dazzling
beach
.
Lately
it
has
become
a
summer
resort
of
notable
and
fashionable
people
;
a
decade
ago
it
was
almost
deserted
after
its
English
clientele
went
north
in
April
.
Now
,
many
bungalows
cluster
near
it
,
but
when
this
story
begins
only
the
cupolas
of
a
dozen
old
villas
rotted
like
water
lilies
among
the
massed
pines
between
Gausse
's
Hôtel
des
Étrangers
and
Cannes
,
five
miles
away
.
The
hotel
and
its
bright
tan
prayer
rug
of
a
beach
were
one
.
In
the
early
morning
the
distant
image
of
Cannes
,
the
pink
and
cream
of
old
fortifications
,
the
purple
Alp
that
bounded
Italy
,
were
cast
across
the
water
and
lay
quavering
in
the
ripples
and
rings
sent
up
by
sea-plants
through
the
clear
shallows
.
Before
eight
a
man
came
down
to
the
beach
in
a
blue
bathrobe
and
with
much
preliminary
application
to
his
person
of
the
chilly
water
,
and
much
grunting
and
loud
breathing
,
floundered
a
minute
in
the
sea
.
When
he
had
gone
,
beach
and
bay
were
quiet
for
an
hour
.
Merchantmen
crawled
westward
on
the
horizon
;
bus
boys
shouted
in
the
hotel
court
;
the
dew
dried
upon
the
pines
.
In
another
hour
the
horns
of
motors
began
to
blow
down
from
the
winding
road
along
the
low
range
of
the
Maures
,
which
separates
the
littoral
from
true
Provençal
France
.
A
mile
from
the
sea
,
where
pines
give
way
to
dusty
poplars
,
is
an
isolated
railroad
stop
,
whence
one
June
morning
in
1925
a
victoria
brought
a
woman
and
her
daughter
down
to
Gausse
's
Hotel
.
The
mother
's
face
was
of
a
fading
prettiness
that
would
soon
be
patted
with
broken
veins
;
her
expression
was
both
tranquil
and
aware
in
a
pleasant
way
.
However
,
one
's
eye
moved
on
quickly
to
her
daughter
,
who
had
magic
in
her
pink
palms
and
her
cheeks
lit
to
a
lovely
flame
,
like
the
thrilling
flush
of
children
after
their
cold
baths
in
the
evening
.
Her
fine
forehead
sloped
gently
up
to
where
her
hair
,
bordering
it
like
an
armorial
shield
,
burst
into
lovelocks
and
waves
and
curlicues
of
ash
blonde
and
gold
.
Her
eyes
were
bright
,
big
,
clear
,
wet
,
and
shining
,
the
color
of
her
cheeks
was
real
,
breaking
close
to
the
surface
from
the
strong
young
pump
of
her
heart
.
Her
body
hovered
delicately
on
the
last
edge
of
childhood
--
she
was
almost
eighteen
,
nearly
complete
,
but
the
dew
was
still
on
her
.
As
sea
and
sky
appeared
below
them
in
a
thin
,
hot
line
the
mother
said
:
``
Something
tells
me
we
're
not
going
to
like
this
place
.
''
``
I
want
to
go
home
anyhow
,
''
the
girl
answered
.
They
both
spoke
cheerfully
but
were
obviously
without
direction
and
bored
by
the
fact
--
moreover
,
just
any
direction
would
not
do
.
They
wanted
high
excitement
,
not
from
the
necessity
of
stimulating
jaded
nerves
but
with
the
avidity
of
prize-winning
schoolchildren
who
deserved
their
vacations
.
``
We
'll
stay
three
days
and
then
go
home
.
I
'll
wire
right
away
for
steamer
tickets
.
''
At
the
hotel
the
girl
made
the
reservation
in
idiomatic
but
rather
flat
French
,
like
something
remembered
.
When
they
were
installed
on
the
ground
floor
she
walked
into
the
glare
of
the
French
windows
and
out
a
few
steps
onto
the
stone
veranda
that
ran
the
length
of
the
hotel
.
When
she
walked
she
carried
herself
like
a
ballet-dancer
,
not
slumped
down
on
her
hips
but
held
up
in
the
small
of
her
back
.
Out
there
the
hot
light
clipped
close
her
shadow
and
she
retreated
--
it
was
too
bright
to
see
.
Fifty
yards
away
the
Mediterranean
yielded
up
its
pigments
,
moment
by
moment
,
to
the
brutal
sunshine
;
below
the
balustrade
a
faded
Buick
cooked
on
the
hotel
drive
.
Indeed
,
of
all
the
region
only
the
beach
stirred
with
activity
.
Three
British
nannies
sat
knitting
the
slow
pattern
of
Victorian
England
,
the
pattern
of
the
forties
,
the
sixties
,
and
the
eighties
,
into
sweaters
and
socks
,
to
the
tune
of
gossip
as
formalized
as
incantation
;
closer
to
the
sea
a
dozen
persons
kept
house
under
striped
umbrellas
,
while
their
dozen
children
pursued
unintimidated
fish
through
the
shallows
or
lay
naked
and
glistening
with
cocoanut
oil
out
in
the
sun
.
As
Rosemary
came
onto
the
beach
a
boy
of
twelve
ran
past
her
and
dashed
into
the
sea
with
exultant
cries
.
Feeling
the
impactive
scrutiny
of
strange
faces
,
she
took
off
her
bathrobe
and
followed
.
She
floated
face
down
for
a
few
yards
and
finding
it
shallow
staggered
to
her
feet
and
plodded
forward
,
dragging
slim
legs
like
weights
against
the
resistance
of
the
water
.
When
it
was
about
breast
high
,
she
glanced
back
toward
shore
:
a
bald
man
in
a
monocle
and
a
pair
of
tights
,
his
tufted
chest
thrown
out
,
his
brash
navel
sucked
in
,
was
regarding
her
attentively
.
As
Rosemary
returned
the
gaze
the
man
dislodged
the
monocle
,
which
went
into
hiding
amid
the
facetious
whiskers
of
his
chest
,
and
poured
himself
a
glass
of
something
from
a
bottle
in
his
hand
.
Rosemary
laid
her
face
on
the
water
and
swam
a
choppy
little
four-beat
crawl
out
to
the
raft
.
The
water
reached
up
for
her
,
pulled
her
down
tenderly
out
of
the
heat
,
seeped
in
her
hair
and
ran
into
the
corners
of
her
body
.
She
turned
round
and
round
in
it
,
embracing
it
,
wallowing
in
it
.
Reaching
the
raft
she
was
out
of
breath
,
but
a
tanned
woman
with
very
white
teeth
looked
down
at
her
,
and
Rosemary
,
suddenly
conscious
of
the
raw
whiteness
of
her
own
body
,
turned
on
her
back
and
drifted
toward
shore
.
The
hairy
man
holding
the
bottle
spoke
to
her
as
she
came
out
.
``
I
say
--
they
have
sharks
out
behind
the
raft
.
''
He
was
of
indeterminate
nationality
,
but
spoke
English
with
a
slow
Oxford
drawl
.
``
Yesterday
they
devoured
two
British
sailors
from
the
flotte
at
Golfe
Juan
.
''
``
Heavens
!
''
exclaimed
Rosemary
.
``
They
come
in
for
the
refuse
from
the
flotte
.
''
Glazing
his
eyes
to
indicate
that
he
had
only
spoken
in
order
to
warn
her
,
he
minced
off
two
steps
and
poured
himself
another
drink
.
Not
unpleasantly
self-conscious
,
since
there
had
been
a
slight
sway
of
attention
toward
her
during
this
conversation
,
Rosemary
looked
for
a
place
to
sit
.
Obviously
each
family
possessed
the
strip
of
sand
immediately
in
front
of
its
umbrella
;
besides
there
was
much
visiting
and
talking
back
and
forth
--
the
atmosphere
of
a
community
upon
which
it
would
be
presumptuous
to
intrude
.
Farther
up
,
where
the
beach
was
strewn
with
pebbles
and
dead
sea-weed
,
sat
a
group
with
flesh
as
white
as
her
own
.
They
lay
under
small
hand-parasols
instead
of
beach
umbrellas
and
were
obviously
less
indigenous
to
the
place
.
Between
the
dark
people
and
the
light
,
Rosemary
found
room
and
spread
out
her
peignoir
on
the
sand
.
Lying
so
,
she
first
heard
their
voices
and
felt
their
feet
skirt
her
body
and
their
shapes
pass
between
the
sun
and
herself
.
The
breath
of
an
inquisitive
dog
blew
warm
and
nervous
on
her
neck
;
she
could
feel
her
skin
broiling
a
little
in
the
heat
and
hear
the
small
exhausted
wa-waa
of
the
expiring
waves
.
Presently
her
ear
distinguished
individual
voices
and
she
became
aware
that
some
one
referred
to
scornfully
as
``
that
North
guy
''
had
kidnapped
a
waiter
from
a
café
in
Cannes
last
night
in
order
to
saw
him
in
two
.
The
sponsor
of
the
story
was
a
white-haired
woman
in
full
evening
dress
,
obviously
a
relic
of
the
previous
evening
,
for
a
tiara
still
clung
to
her
head
and
a
discouraged
orchid
expired
from
her
shoulder
.
Rosemary
,
forming
a
vague
antipathy
to
her
and
her
companions
,
turned
away
.
Nearest
her
,
on
the
other
side
,
a
young
woman
lay
under
a
roof
of
umbrellas
making
out
a
list
of
things
from
a
book
open
on
the
sand
.
Her
bathing
suit
was
pulled
off
her
shoulders
and
her
back
,
a
ruddy
,
orange
brown
,
set
off
by
a
string
of
creamy
pearls
,
shone
in
the
sun
.
Her
face
was
hard
and
lovely
and
pitiful
.
Her
eyes
met
Rosemary
's
but
did
not
see
her
.
Beyond
her
was
a
fine
man
in
a
jockey
cap
and
red-striped
tights
;
then
the
woman
Rosemary
had
seen
on
the
raft
,
and
who
looked
back
at
her
,
seeing
her
;
then
a
man
with
a
long
face
and
a
golden
,
leonine
head
,
with
blue
tights
and
no
hat
,
talking
very
seriously
to
an
unmistakably
Latin
young
man
in
black
tights
,
both
of
them
picking
at
little
pieces
of
seaweed
in
the
sand
.
She
thought
they
were
mostly
Americans
,
but
something
made
them
unlike
the
Americans
she
had
known
of
late
.
After
a
while
she
realized
that
the
man
in
the
jockey
cap
was
giving
a
quiet
little
performance
for
this
group
;
he
moved
gravely
about
with
a
rake
,
ostensibly
removing
gravel
and
meanwhile
developing
some
esoteric
burlesque
held
in
suspension
by
his
grave
face
.
Its
faintest
ramification
had
become
hilarious
,
until
whatever
he
said
released
a
burst
of
laughter
.
Even
those
who
,
like
herself
,
were
too
far
away
to
hear
,
sent
out
antennæ
of
attention
until
the
only
person
on
the
beach
not
caught
up
in
it
was
the
young
woman
with
the
string
of
pearls
.
Perhaps
from
modesty
of
possession
she
responded
to
each
salvo
of
amusement
by
bending
closer
over
her
list
.
The
man
of
the
monocle
and
bottle
spoke
suddenly
out
of
the
sky
above
Rosemary
.
``
You
are
a
ripping
swimmer
.
''
She
demurred
.
``
Jolly
good
.
My
name
is
Campion
.
Here
is
a
lady
who
says
she
saw
you
in
Sorrento
last
week
and
knows
who
you
are
and
would
so
like
to
meet
you
.
''
Glancing
around
with
concealed
annoyance
Rosemary
saw
the
untanned
people
were
waiting
.
Reluctantly
she
got
up
and
went
over
to
them
.
``
Mrs.
Abrams
--
Mrs.
McKisco
--
Mr.
McKisco
--
Mr.
Dumphry
--
``
We
know
who
you
are
,
''
spoke
up
the
woman
in
evening
dress
.
``
You
're
Rosemary
Hoyt
and
I
recognized
you
in
Sorrento
and
asked
the
hotel
clerk
and
we
all
think
you
're
perfectly
marvellous
and
we
want
to
know
why
you
're
not
back
in
America
making
another
marvellous
moving
picture
.
''
They
made
a
superfluous
gesture
of
moving
over
for
her
.
The
woman
who
had
recognized
her
was
not
a
Jewess
,
despite
her
name
.
She
was
one
of
those
elderly
``
good
sports
''
preserved
by
an
imperviousness
to
experience
and
a
good
digestion
into
another
generation
.
``
We
wanted
to
warn
you
about
getting
burned
the
first
day
,
''
she
continued
cheerily
,
``
because
your
skin
is
important
,
but
there
seems
to
be
so
darn
much
formality
on
this
beach
that
we
did
n't
know
whether
you
'd
mind
.
''
II
``
We
thought
maybe
you
were
in
the
plot
,
''
said
Mrs.
McKisco
.
She
was
a
shabby-eyed
,
pretty
young
woman
with
a
disheartening
intensity
.
``
We
do
n't
know
who
's
in
the
plot
and
who
is
n't
.
One
man
my
husband
had
been
particularly
nice
to
turned
out
to
be
a
chief
character
--
practically
the
assistant
hero
.
''
``
The
plot
?
''
inquired
Rosemary
,
half
understanding
.
``
Is
there
a
plot
?
''
``
My
dear
,
we
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Mrs.
Abrams
,
with
a
convulsive
,
stout
woman
's
chuckle
.
``
We
're
not
in
it
.
We
're
the
gallery
.
''
Mr.
Dumphry
,
a
tow-headed
effeminate
young
man
,
remarked
:
``
Mama
Abrams
is
a
plot
in
herself
,
''
and
Campion
shook
his
monocle
at
him
,
saying
:
``
Now
,
Royal
,
do
n't
be
too
ghastly
for
words
.
''
Rosemary
looked
at
them
all
uncomfortably
,
wishing
her
mother
had
come
down
here
with
her
.
She
did
not
like
these
people
,
especially
in
her
immediate
comparison
of
them
with
those
who
had
interested
her
at
the
other
end
of
the
beach
.
Her
mother
's
modest
but
compact
social
gift
got
them
out
of
unwelcome
situations
swiftly
and
firmly
.
But
Rosemary
had
been
a
celebrity
for
only
six
months
,
and
sometimes
the
French
manners
of
her
early
adolescence
and
the
democratic
manners
of
America
,
these
latter
superimposed
,
made
a
certain
confusion
and
let
her
in
for
just
such
things
.
Mr.
McKisco
,
a
scrawny
,
freckle-and-red
man
of
thirty
,
did
not
find
the
topic
of
the
``
plot
''
amusing
.
He
had
been
staring
at
the
sea
--
now
after
a
swift
glance
at
his
wife
he
turned
to
Rosemary
and
demanded
aggressively
:
``
Been
here
long
?
''
``
Only
a
day
.
''
``
Oh
.
''
Evidently
feeling
that
the
subject
had
been
thoroughly
changed
,
he
looked
in
turn
at
the
others
.
``
Going
to
stay
all
summer
?
''
asked
Mrs.
McKisco
,
innocently
.
``
If
you
do
you
can
watch
the
plot
unfold
.
''
``
For
God
's
sake
,
Violet
,
drop
the
subject
!
''
exploded
her
husband
.
``
Get
a
new
joke
,
for
God
's
sake
!
''
Mrs.
McKisco
swayed
toward
Mrs.
Abrams
and
breathed
audibly
:
``
He
's
nervous
.
''
``
I
'm
not
nervous
,
''
disagreed
McKisco
.
``
It
just
happens
I
'm
not
nervous
at
all
.
''
He
was
burning
visibly
--
a
grayish
flush
had
spread
over
his
face
,
dissolving
all
his
expressions
into
a
vast
ineffectuality
.
Suddenly
remotely
conscious
of
his
condition
he
got
up
to
go
in
the
water
,
followed
by
his
wife
,
and
seizing
the
opportunity
Rosemary
followed
.
Mr.
McKisco
drew
a
long
breath
,
flung
himself
into
the
shallows
and
began
a
stiff-armed
batting
of
the
Mediterranean
,
obviously
intended
to
suggest
a
crawl
--
his
breath
exhausted
he
arose
and
looked
around
with
an
expression
of
surprise
that
he
was
still
in
sight
of
shore
.
``
I
have
n't
learned
to
breathe
yet
.
I
never
quite
understood
how
they
breathed
.
''
He
looked
at
Rosemary
inquiringly
.
``
I
think
you
breathe
out
under
water
,
''
she
explained
.
``
And
every
fourth
beat
you
roll
your
head
over
for
air
.
''
``
The
breathing
's
the
hardest
part
for
me
.
Shall
we
go
to
the
raft
?
''
The
man
with
the
leonine
head
lay
stretched
out
upon
the
raft
,
which
tipped
back
and
forth
with
the
motion
of
the
water
.
As
Mrs.
McKisco
reached
for
it
a
sudden
tilt
struck
her
arm
up
roughly
,
whereupon
the
man
started
up
and
pulled
her
on
board
.
``
I
was
afraid
it
hit
you
.
''
His
voice
was
slow
and
shy
;
he
had
one
of
the
saddest
faces
Rosemary
had
ever
seen
,
the
high
cheekbones
of
an
Indian
,
a
long
upper
lip
,
and
enormous
deep-set
dark
golden
eyes
.
He
had
spoken
out
of
the
side
of
his
mouth
,
as
if
he
hoped
his
words
would
reach
Mrs.
McKisco
by
a
circuitous
and
unobtrusive
route
;
in
a
minute
he
had
shoved
off
into
the
water
and
his
long
body
lay
motionless
toward
shore
.
Rosemary
and
Mrs.
McKisco
watched
him
.
When
he
had
exhausted
his
momentum
he
abruptly
bent
double
,
his
thin
thighs
rose
above
the
surface
,
and
he
disappeared
totally
,
leaving
scarcely
a
fleck
of
foam
behind
.
``
He
's
a
good
swimmer
,
''
Rosemary
said
.
Mrs.
McKisco
's
answer
came
with
surprising
violence
.
``
Well
,
he
's
a
rotten
musician
.
''
She
turned
to
her
husband
,
who
after
two
unsuccessful
attempts
had
managed
to
climb
on
the
raft
,
and
having
attained
his
balance
was
trying
to
make
some
kind
of
compensatory
flourish
,
achieving
only
an
extra
stagger
.
``
I
was
just
saying
that
Abe
North
may
be
a
good
swimmer
but
he
's
a
rotten
musician
.
''
``
Yes
,
''
agreed
McKisco
,
grudgingly
.
Obviously
he
had
created
his
wife
's
world
,
and
allowed
her
few
liberties
in
it
.
``
Antheil
's
my
man
.
''
Mrs.
McKisco
turned
challengingly
to
Rosemary
,
``
Anthiel
and
Joyce
.
I
do
n't
suppose
you
ever
hear
much
about
those
sort
of
people
in
Hollywood
,
but
my
husband
wrote
the
first
criticism
of
Ulysses
that
ever
appeared
in
America
.
''
``
I
wish
I
had
a
cigarette
,
''
said
McKisco
calmly
.
``
That
's
more
important
to
me
just
now
.
''
``
He
's
got
insides
--
do
n't
you
think
so
,
Albert
?
''
Her
voice
faded
off
suddenly
.
The
woman
of
the
pearls
had
joined
her
two
children
in
the
water
,
and
now
Abe
North
came
up
under
one
of
them
like
a
volcanic
island
,
raising
him
on
his
shoulders
.
The
child
yelled
with
fear
and
delight
and
the
woman
watched
with
a
lovely
peace
,
without
a
smile
.
``
Is
that
his
wife
?
''
Rosemary
asked
.
``
No
,
that
's
Mrs.
Diver
.
They
're
not
at
the
hotel
.
''
Her
eyes
,
photographic
,
did
not
move
from
the
woman
's
face
.
After
a
moment
she
turned
vehemently
to
Rosemary
.
``
Have
you
been
abroad
before
?
''
``
Yes
--
I
went
to
school
in
Paris
.
''
``
Oh
!
Well
then
you
probably
know
that
if
you
want
to
enjoy
yourself
here
the
thing
is
to
get
to
know
some
real
French
families
.
What
do
these
people
get
out
of
it
?
''
She
pointed
her
left
shoulder
toward
shore
.
``
They
just
stick
around
with
each
other
in
little
cliques
.
Of
course
,
we
had
letters
of
introduction
and
met
all
the
best
French
artists
and
writers
in
Paris
.
That
made
it
very
nice
.
''
``
I
should
think
so
.
''
``
My
husband
is
finishing
his
first
novel
,
you
see
.
''
Rosemary
said
:
``
Oh
,
he
is
?
''
She
was
not
thinking
anything
special
,
except
wondering
whether
her
mother
had
got
to
sleep
in
this
heat
.
``
It
's
on
the
idea
of
Ulysses
,
''
continued
Mrs.
McKisco
.
``
Only
instead
of
taking
twenty-four
hours
my
husband
takes
a
hundred
years
.
He
takes
a
decayed
old
French
aristocrat
and
puts
him
in
contrast
with
the
mechanical
age
--
''
``
Oh
,
for
God
's
sake
,
Violet
,
do
n't
go
telling
everybody
the
idea
,
''
protested
McKisco
.
``
I
do
n't
want
it
to
get
all
around
before
the
book
's
published
.
''
Rosemary
swam
back
to
the
shore
,
where
she
threw
her
peignoir
over
her
already
sore
shoulders
and
lay
down
again
in
the
sun
.
The
man
with
the
jockey
cap
was
now
going
from
umbrella
to
umbrella
carrying
a
bottle
and
little
glasses
in
his
hands
;
presently
he
and
his
friends
grew
livelier
and
closer
together
and
now
they
were
all
under
a
single
assemblage
of
umbrellas
--
she
gathered
that
some
one
was
leaving
and
that
this
was
a
last
drink
on
the
beach
.
Even
the
children
knew
that
excitement
was
generating
under
that
umbrella
and
turned
toward
it
--
and
it
seemed
to
Rosemary
that
it
all
came
from
the
man
in
the
jockey
cap
.
Noon
dominated
sea
and
sky
--
even
the
white
line
of
Cannes
,
five
miles
off
,
had
faded
to
a
mirage
of
what
was
fresh
and
cool
;
a
robin-breasted
sailing
boat
pulled
in
behind
it
a
strand
from
the
outer
,
darker
sea
.
It
seemed
that
there
was
no
life
anywhere
in
all
this
expanse
of
coast
except
under
the
filtered
sunlight
of
those
umbrellas
,
where
something
went
on
amid
the
color
and
the
murmur
.
Campion
walked
near
her
,
stood
a
few
feet
away
and
Rosemary
closed
her
eyes
,
pretending
to
be
asleep
;
then
she
half-opened
them
and
watched
two
dim
,
blurred
pillars
that
were
legs
.
The
man
tried
to
edge
his
way
into
a
sand-colored
cloud
,
but
the
cloud
floated
off
into
the
vast
hot
sky
.
Rosemary
fell
really
asleep
.
She
awoke
drenched
with
sweat
to
find
the
beach
deserted
save
for
the
man
in
the
jockey
cap
,
who
was
folding
a
last
umbrella
.
As
Rosemary
lay
blinking
,
he
walked
nearer
and
said
:
``
I
was
going
to
wake
you
before
I
left
.
It
's
not
good
to
get
too
burned
right
away
.
''
``
Thank
you
.
''
Rosemary
looked
down
at
her
crimson
legs
.
``
Heavens
!
''
She
laughed
cheerfully
,
inviting
him
to
talk
,
but
Dick
Diver
was
already
carrying
a
tent
and
a
beach
umbrella
up
to
a
waiting
car
,
so
she
went
into
the
water
to
wash
off
the
sweat
.
He
came
back
and
gathering
up
a
rake
,
a
shovel
,
and
a
sieve
,
stowed
them
in
a
crevice
of
a
rock
.
He
glanced
up
and
down
the
beach
to
see
if
he
had
left
anything
.
``
Do
you
know
what
time
it
is
?
''
Rosemary
asked
.
``
It
's
about
half-past
one
.
''
They
faced
the
seascape
together
momentarily
.
``
It
's
not
a
bad
time
,
''
said
Dick
Diver
.
``
It
's
not
one
of
worst
times
of
the
day
.
''
He
looked
at
her
and
for
a
moment
she
lived
in
the
bright
blue
worlds
of
his
eyes
,
eagerly
and
confidently
.
Then
he
shouldered
his
last
piece
of
junk
and
went
up
to
his
car
,
and
Rosemary
came
out
of
the
water
,
shook
out
her
peignoir
and
walked
up
to
the
hotel
.
III
It
was
almost
two
when
they
went
into
the
dining-room
.
Back
and
forth
over
the
deserted
tables
a
heavy
pattern
of
beams
and
shadows
swayed
with
the
motion
of
the
pines
outside
.
Two
waiters
,
piling
plates
and
talking
loud
Italian
,
fell
silent
when
they
came
in
and
brought
them
a
tired
version
of
the
table
d'hôte
luncheon
.
``
I
fell
in
love
on
the
beach
,
''
said
Rosemary
.
``
Who
with
?
''
``
First
with
a
whole
lot
of
people
who
looked
nice
.
Then
with
one
man
.
''
``
Did
you
talk
to
him
?
''
``
Just
a
little
.
Very
handsome
.
With
reddish
hair
.
''
She
was
eating
,
ravenously
.
``
He
's
married
though
--
it
's
usually
the
way
.
''
Her
mother
was
her
best
friend
and
had
put
every
last
possibility
into
the
guiding
of
her
,
not
so
rare
a
thing
in
the
theatrical
profession
,
but
rather
special
in
that
Mrs.
Elsie
Speers
was
not
recompensing
herself
for
a
defeat
of
her
own
.
She
had
no
personal
bitterness
or
resentments
about
life
--
twice
satisfactorily
married
and
twice
widowed
,
her
cheerful
stoicism
had
each
time
deepened
.
One
of
her
husbands
had
been
a
cavalry
officer
and
one
an
army
doctor
,
and
they
both
left
something
to
her
that
she
tried
to
present
intact
to
Rosemary
.
By
not
sparing
Rosemary
she
had
made
her
hard
--
by
not
sparing
her
own
labor
and
devotion
she
had
cultivated
an
idealism
in
Rosemary
,
which
at
present
was
directed
toward
herself
and
saw
the
world
through
her
eyes
.
So
that
while
Rosemary
was
a
``
simple
''
child
she
was
protected
by
a
double
sheath
of
her
mother
's
armor
and
her
own
--
she
had
a
mature
distrust
of
the
trivial
,
the
facile
and
the
vulgar
.
However
,
with
Rosemary
's
sudden
success
in
pictures
Mrs.
Speers
felt
that
it
was
time
she
were
spiritually
weaned
;
it
would
please
rather
than
pain
her
if
this
somewhat
bouncing
,
breathless
and
exigent
idealism
would
focus
on
something
except
herself
.
``
Then
you
like
it
here
?
''
she
asked
.
``
It
might
be
fun
if
we
knew
those
people
.
There
were
some
other
people
,
but
they
were
n't
nice
.
They
recognized
me
--
no
matter
where
we
go
everybody
's
seen
'Daddy
's
Girl
.
'
''
Mrs.
Speers
waited
for
the
glow
of
egotism
to
subside
;
then
she
said
in
a
matter-of-fact
way
:
``
That
reminds
me
,
when
are
you
going
to
see
Earl
Brady
?
''
``
I
thought
we
might
go
this
afternoon
--
if
you
're
rested
.
''
``
You
go
--
I
'm
not
going
.
''
``
We
'll
wait
till
to-morrow
then
.
''
``
I
want
you
to
go
alone
.
It
's
only
a
short
way
--
it
is
n't
as
if
you
did
n't
speak
French
.
''
``
Mother
--
are
n't
there
some
things
I
do
n't
have
to
do
?
''
``
Oh
,
well
then
go
later
--
but
some
day
before
we
leave
.
''
``
All
right
,
Mother
.
''
After
lunch
they
were
both
overwhelmed
by
the
sudden
flatness
that
comes
over
American
travellers
in
quiet
foreign
places
.
No
stimuli
worked
upon
them
,
no
voices
called
them
from
without
,
no
fragments
of
their
own
thoughts
came
suddenly
from
the
minds
of
others
,
and
missing
the
clamor
of
Empire
they
felt
that
life
was
not
continuing
here
.
``
Let
's
only
stay
three
days
,
Mother
,
''
Rosemary
said
when
they
were
back
in
their
rooms
.
Outside
a
light
wind
blew
the
heat
around
,
straining
it
through
the
trees
and
sending
little
hot
gusts
through
the
shutters
.
``
How
about
the
man
you
fell
in
love
with
on
the
beach
?
''
``
I
do
n't
love
anybody
but
you
,
Mother
,
darling
.
''
Rosemary
stopped
in
the
lobby
and
spoke
to
Gausse
père
about
trains
.
The
concierge
,
lounging
in
light-brown
khaki
by
the
desk
,
stared
at
her
rigidly
,
then
suddenly
remembered
the
manners
of
his
métier
.
She
took
the
bus
and
rode
with
a
pair
of
obsequious
waiters
to
the
station
,
embarrassed
by
their
deferential
silence
,
wanting
to
urge
them
:
``
Go
on
,
talk
,
enjoy
yourselves
.
It
does
n't
bother
me
.
''
The
first-class
compartment
was
stifling
;
the
vivid
advertising
cards
of
the
railroad
companies
--
The
Pont
du
Gard
at
Arles
,
the
Amphitheatre
at
Orange
,
winter
sports
at
Chamonix
--
were
fresher
than
the
long
motionless
sea
outside
.
Unlike
American
trains
that
were
absorbed
in
an
intense
destiny
of
their
own
,
and
scornful
of
people
on
another
world
less
swift
and
breathless
,
this
train
was
part
of
the
country
through
which
it
passed
.
Its
breath
stirred
the
dust
from
the
palm
leaves
,
the
cinders
mingled
with
the
dry
dung
in
the
gardens
.
Rosemary
was
sure
she
could
lean
from
the
window
and
pull
flowers
with
her
hand
.
A
dozen
cabbies
slept
in
their
hacks
outside
the
Cannes
station
.
Over
on
the
promenade
the
Casino
,
the
smart
shops
,
and
the
great
hotels
turned
blank
iron
masks
to
the
summer
sea
.
It
was
unbelievable
that
there
could
ever
have
been
a
``
season
,
''
and
Rosemary
,
half
in
the
grip
of
fashion
,
became
a
little
self-conscious
,
as
though
she
were
displaying
an
unhealthy
taste
for
the
moribund
;
as
though
people
were
wondering
why
she
was
here
in
the
lull
between
the
gaiety
of
last
winter
and
next
winter
,
while
up
north
the
true
world
thundered
by
.
As
she
came
out
of
a
drug
store
with
a
bottle
of
cocoanut
oil
,
a
woman
,
whom
she
recognized
as
Mrs.
Diver
,
crossed
her
path
with
arms
full
of
sofa
cushions
,
and
went
to
a
car
parked
down
the
street
.
A
long
,
low
black
dog
barked
at
her
,
a
dozing
chauffeur
woke
with
a
start
.
She
sat
in
the
car
,
her
lovely
face
set
,
controlled
,
her
eyes
brave
and
watchful
,
looking
straight
ahead
toward
nothing
.
Her
dress
was
bright
red
and
her
brown
legs
were
bare
.
She
had
thick
,
dark
,
gold
hair
like
a
chow
's
.
With
half
an
hour
to
wait
for
her
train
Rosemary
sat
down
in
the
Café
des
Alliés
on
the
Croisette
,
where
the
trees
made
a
green
twilight
over
the
tables
and
an
orchestra
wooed
an
imaginary
public
of
cosmopolites
with
the
Nice
Carnival
Song
and
last
year
's
American
tune
.
She
had
bought
Le
Temps
and
The
Saturday
Evening
Post
for
her
mother
,
and
as
she
drank
her
citronade
she
opened
the
latter
at
the
memoirs
of
a
Russian
princess
,
finding
the
dim
conventions
of
the
nineties
realer
and
nearer
than
the
headlines
of
the
French
paper
.
It
was
the
same
feeling
that
had
oppressed
her
at
the
hotel
--
accustomed
to
seeing
the
starkest
grotesqueries
of
a
continent
heavily
underlined
as
comedy
or
tragedy
,
untrained
to
the
task
of
separating
out
the
essential
for
herself
,
she
now
began
to
feel
that
French
life
was
empty
and
stale
.
This
feeling
was
surcharged
by
listening
to
the
sad
tunes
of
the
orchestra
,
reminiscent
of
the
melancholy
music
played
for
acrobats
in
vaudeville
.
She
was
glad
to
go
back
to
Gausse
's
Hotel
.
Her
shoulders
were
too
burned
to
swim
with
the
next
day
,
so
she
and
her
mother
hired
a
car
--
after
much
haggling
,
for
Rosemary
had
formed
her
valuations
of
money
in
France
--
and
drove
along
the
Riviera
,
the
delta
of
many
rivers
.
The
chauffeur
,
a
Russian
Czar
of
the
period
of
Ivan
the
Terrible
,
was
a
self-appointed
guide
,
and
the
resplendent
names
--
Cannes
,
Nice
,
Monte
Carlo
--
began
to
glow
through
their
torpid
camouflage
,
whispering
of
old
kings
come
here
to
dine
or
die
,
of
rajahs
tossing
Buddha
's
eyes
to
English
ballerinas
,
of
Russian
princes
turning
the
weeks
into
Baltic
twilights
in
the
lost
caviare
days
.
Most
of
all
,
there
was
the
scent
of
the
Russians
along
the
coast
--
their
closed
book
shops
and
grocery
stores
.
Ten
years
ago
,
when
the
season
ended
in
April
,
the
doors
of
the
Orthodox
Church
were
locked
,
and
the
sweet
champagnes
they
favored
were
put
away
until
their
return
.
``
We
'll
be
back
next
season
,
''
they
said
,
but
this
was
premature
,
for
they
were
never
coming
back
any
more
.
It
was
pleasant
to
drive
back
to
the
hotel
in
the
late
afternoon
,
above
a
sea
as
mysteriously
colored
as
the
agates
and
cornelians
of
childhood
,
green
as
green
milk
,
blue
as
laundry
water
,
wine
dark
.
It
was
pleasant
to
pass
people
eating
outside
their
doors
,
and
to
hear
the
fierce
mechanical
pianos
behind
the
vines
of
country
estaminets
.
When
they
turned
off
the
Corniche
d'Or
and
down
to
Gausse
's
Hotel
through
the
darkening
banks
of
trees
,
set
one
behind
another
in
many
greens
,
the
moon
already
hovered
over
the
ruins
of
the
aqueducts
.
.
.
.
Somewhere
in
the
hills
behind
the
hotel
there
was
a
dance
,
and
Rosemary
listened
to
the
music
through
the
ghostly
moonshine
of
her
mosquito
net
,
realizing
that
there
was
gaiety
too
somewhere
about
,
and
she
thought
of
the
nice
people
on
the
beach
.
She
thought
she
might
meet
them
in
the
morning
,
but
they
obviously
formed
a
self-sufficient
little
group
,
and
once
their
umbrellas
,
bamboo
rugs
,
dogs
,
and
children
were
set
out
in
place
the
part
of
the
plage
was
literally
fenced
in
.
She
resolved
in
any
case
not
to
spend
her
last
two
mornings
with
the
other
ones
.
IV
The
matter
was
solved
for
her
.
The
McKiscos
were
not
yet
there
and
she
had
scarcely
spread
her
peignoir
when
two
men
--
the
man
with
the
jockey
cap
and
the
tall
blonde
man
,
given
to
sawing
waiters
in
two
--
left
the
group
and
came
down
toward
her
.
``
Good
morning
,
''
said
Dick
Diver
.
He
broke
down
.
``
Look
--
sunburn
or
no
sunburn
,
why
did
you
stay
away
yesterday
?
We
worried
about
you
.
''
She
sat
up
and
her
happy
little
laugh
welcomed
their
intrusion
.
``
We
wondered
,
''
Dick
Diver
said
,
``
if
you
would
n't
come
over
this
morning
.
We
go
in
,
we
take
food
and
drink
,
so
it
's
a
substantial
invitation
.
''
He
seemed
kind
and
charming
--
his
voice
promised
that
he
would
take
care
of
her
,
and
that
a
little
later
he
would
open
up
whole
new
worlds
for
her
,
unroll
an
endless
succession
of
magnificent
possibilities
.
He
managed
the
introduction
so
that
her
name
was
n't
mentioned
and
then
let
her
know
easily
that
everyone
knew
who
she
was
but
were
respecting
the
completeness
of
her
private
life
--
a
courtesy
that
Rosemary
had
not
met
with
save
from
professional
people
since
her
success
.
Nicole
Diver
,
her
brown
back
hanging
from
her
pearls
,
was
looking
through
a
recipe
book
for
chicken
Maryland
.
She
was
about
twenty-four
,
Rosemary
guessed
--
her
face
could
have
been
described
in
terms
of
conventional
prettiness
,
but
the
effect
was
that
it
had
been
made
first
on
the
heroic
scale
with
strong
structure
and
marking
,
as
if
the
features
and
vividness
of
brow
and
coloring
,
everything
we
associate
with
temperament
and
character
had
been
molded
with
a
Rodinesque
intention
,
and
then
chiseled
away
in
the
direction
of
prettiness
to
a
point
where
a
single
slip
would
have
irreparably
diminished
its
force
and
quality
.
With
the
mouth
the
sculptor
had
taken
desperate
chances
--
it
was
the
cupid
's
bow
of
a
magazine
cover
,
yet
it
shared
the
distinction
of
the
rest
.
``
Are
you
here
for
a
long
time
?
''
Nicole
asked
.
Her
voice
was
low
,
almost
harsh
.
Suddenly
Rosemary
let
the
possibility
enter
her
mind
that
they
might
stay
another
week
.
``
Not
very
long
,
''
she
answered
vaguely
.
``
We
've
been
abroad
a
long
time
--
we
landed
in
Sicily
in
March
and
we
've
been
slowly
working
our
way
north
.
I
got
pneumonia
making
a
picture
last
January
and
I
've
been
recuperating
.
''
``
Mercy
!
How
did
that
happen
?
''
``
Well
,
it
was
from
swimming
,
''
Rosemary
was
rather
reluctant
at
embarking
upon
personal
revelations
.
``
One
day
I
happened
to
have
the
grippe
and
did
n't
know
it
,
and
they
were
taking
a
scene
where
I
dove
into
a
canal
in
Venice
.
It
was
a
very
expensive
set
,
so
I
had
to
dive
and
dive
and
dive
all
morning
.
Mother
had
a
doctor
right
there
,
but
it
was
no
use
--
I
got
pneumonia
.
''
She
changed
the
subject
determinedly
before
they
could
speak
.
``
Do
you
like
it
here
--
this
place
?
''
``
They
have
to
like
it
,
''
said
Abe
North
slowly
.
``
They
invented
it
.
''
He
turned
his
noble
head
slowly
so
that
his
eyes
rested
with
tenderness
and
affection
on
the
two
Divers
.
``
Oh
,
did
you
?
''
``
This
is
only
the
second
season
that
the
hotel
's
been
open
in
summer
,
''
Nicole
explained
.
``
We
persuaded
Gausse
to
keep
on
a
cook
and
a
garçon
and
a
chasseur
--
it
paid
its
way
and
this
year
it
's
doing
even
better
.
''
``
But
you
're
not
in
the
hotel
.
''
``
We
built
a
house
,
up
at
Tarmes
.
''
``
The
theory
is
,
''
said
Dick
,
arranging
an
umbrella
to
clip
a
square
of
sunlight
off
Rosemary
's
shoulder
,
``
that
all
the
northern
places
,
like
Deauville
,
were
picked
out
by
Russians
and
English
who
do
n't
mind
the
cold
,
while
half
of
us
Americans
come
from
tropical
climates
--
that
's
why
we
're
beginning
to
come
here
.
''
The
young
man
of
Latin
aspect
had
been
turning
the
pages
of
The
New
York
Herald
.
``
Well
,
what
nationality
are
these
people
?
''
he
demanded
,
suddenly
,
and
read
with
a
slight
French
intonation
,
``
'Registered
at
the
Hotel
Palace
at
Vevey
are
Mr.
Pandely
Vlasco
,
Mme

Bonneasse

--
I
do
n't
exaggerate
--
'Corinna

'
She

most
--
Geneveva
de
Momus
.
Almost
worth
running
up
to
Vevey
to
take
a
look
at
Geneveva
de
Momus
.
''
He
stood
up
with
sudden
restlessness
,
stretching
himself
with
one
sharp
movement
.
He
was
a
few
years
younger
than
Diver
or
North
.
He
was
tall
and
his
body
was
hard
but
overspare
save
for
the
bunched
force
gathered
in
his
shoulders
and
upper
arms
.
At
first
glance
he
seemed
conventionally
handsome
--
but
there
was
a
faint
disgust
always
in
his
face
which
marred
the
full
fierce
lustre
of
his
brown
eyes
.
Yet
one
remembered
them
afterward
,
when
one
had
forgotten
the
inability
of
the
mouth
to
endure
boredom
and
the
young
forehead
with
its
furrows
of
fretful
and
unprofitable
pain
.
``
We
found
some
fine
ones
in
the
news
of
Americans
last
week
,
''
said
Nicole
.
``
Mrs.
Evelyn
Oyster
and
--
what
were
the
others
?
''
``
There
was
Mr.
S.
Flesh
,
''
said
Diver
,
getting
up
also
.
He
took
his
rake
and
began
to
work
seriously
at
getting
small
stones
out
of
the
sand
.
``
Oh
,
yes
--
S.
Flesh
--
does
n't
he
give
you
the
creeps
?
''
It
was
quiet
alone
with
Nicole
--
Rosemary
found
it
even
quieter
than
with
her
mother
.
Abe
North
and
Barban
,
the
Frenchman
,
were
talking
about
Morocco
,
and
Nicole
having
copied
her
recipe
picked
up
a
piece
of
sewing
.
Rosemary
examined
their
appurtenances
--
four
large
parasols
that
made
a
canopy
of
shade
,
a
portable
bath
house
for
dressing
,
a
pneumatic
rubber
horse
,
new
things
that
Rosemary
had
never
seen
,
from
the
first
burst
of
luxury
manufacturing
after
the
War
,
and
probably
in
the
hands
of
the
first
of
purchasers
.
She
had
gathered
that
they
were
fashionable
people
,
but
though
her
mother
had
brought
her
up
to
beware
such
people
as
drones
,
she
did
not
feel
that
way
here
.
Even
in
their
absolute
immobility
,
complete
as
that
of
the
morning
,
she
felt
a
purpose
,
a
working
over
something
,
a
direction
,
an
act
of
creation
different
from
any
she
had
known
.
Her
immature
mind
made
no
speculations
upon
the
nature
of
their
relation
to
each
other
,
she
was
only
concerned
with
their
attitude
toward
herself
--
but
she
perceived
the
web
of
some
pleasant
interrelation
,
which
she
expressed
with
the
thought
that
they
seemed
to
have
a
very
good
time
.
She
looked
in
turn
at
the
three
men
,
temporarily
expropriating
them
.
All
three
were
personable
in
different
ways
;
all
were
of
a
special
gentleness
that
she
felt
was
part
of
their
lives
,
past
and
future
,
not
circumstanced
by
events
,
not
at
all
like
the
company
manners
of
actors
,
and
she
detected
also
a
far-reaching
delicacy
that
was
different
from
the
rough
and
ready
good
fellowship
of
directors
,
who
represented
the
intellectuals
in
her
life
.
Actors
and
directors
--
those
were
the
only
men
she
had
ever
known
,
those
and
the
heterogeneous
,
indistinguishable
mass
of
college
boys
,
interested
only
in
love
at
first
sight
,
whom
she
had
met
at
the
Yale
prom
last
fall
.
These
three
were
different
.
Barban
was
less
civilized
,
more
skeptical
and
scoffing
,
his
manners
were
formal
,
even
perfunctory
.
Abe
North
had
,
under
his
shyness
,
a
desperate
humor
that
amused
but
puzzled
her
.
Her
serious
nature
distrusted
its
ability
to
make
a
supreme
impression
on
him
.
But
Dick
Diver
--
he
was
all
complete
there
.
Silently
she
admired
him
.
His
complexion
was
reddish
and
weather-burned
,
so
was
his
short
hair
--
a
light
growth
of
it
rolled
down
his
arms
and
hands
.
His
eyes
were
of
a
bright
,
hard
blue
.
His
nose
was
somewhat
pointed
and
there
was
never
any
doubt
at
whom
he
was
looking
or
talking
--
and
this
is
a
flattering
attention
,
for
who
looks
at
us
?
--
glances
fall
upon
us
,
curious
or
disinterested
,
nothing
more
.
His
voice
,
with
some
faint
Irish
melody
running
through
it
,
wooed
the
world
,
yet
she
felt
the
layer
of
hardness
in
him
,
of
self-control
and
of
self-discipline
,
her
own
virtues
.
Oh
,
she
chose
him
,
and
Nicole
,
lifting
her
head
saw
her
choose
him
,
heard
the
little
sigh
at
the
fact
that
he
was
already
possessed
.
Toward
noon
the
McKiscos
,
Mrs.
Abrams
,
Mr.
Dumphry
,
and
Signor
Campion
came
on
the
beach
.
They
had
brought
a
new
umbrella
that
they
set
up
with
side
glances
toward
the
Divers
,
and
crept
under
with
satisfied
expressions
--
all
save
Mr.
McKisco
,
who
remained
derisively
without
.
In
his
raking
Dick
had
passed
near
them
and
now
he
returned
to
the
umbrellas
.
``
The
two
young
men
are
reading
the
Book
of
Etiquette
together
,
''
he
said
in
a
low
voice
.
``
Planning
to
mix
wit
de
quality
,
''
said
Abe
.
Mary
North
,
the
very
tanned
young
woman
whom
Rosemary
had
encountered
the
first
day
on
the
raft
,
came
in
from
swimming
and
said
with
a
smile
that
was
a
rakish
gleam
:
``
So
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Neverquiver
have
arrived
.
''
``
They
're
this
man
's
friends
,
''
Nicole
reminded
her
,
indicating
Abe
.
``
Why
does
n't
he
go
and
speak
to
them
?
Do
n't
you
think
they
're
attractive
?
''
``
I
think
they
're
very
attractive
,
''
Abe
agreed
.
``
I
just
do
n't
think
they
're
attractive
,
that
's
all
.
''
``
Well
,
I
have
felt
there
were
too
many
people
on
the
beach
this
summer
,
''
Nicole
admitted
.
``
Our
beach
that
Dick
made
out
of
a
pebble
pile
.
''
She
considered
,
and
then
lowering
her
voice
out
of
the
range
of
the
trio
of
nannies
who
sat
back
under
another
umbrella
.
``
Still
,
they
're
preferable
to
those
British
last
summer
who
kept
shouting
about
:
'Is
n't
the
sea
blue
?
Is
n't
the
sky
white
?
Is
n't
little
Nellie
's
nose
red
?
'
''
Rosemary
thought
she
would
not
like
to
have
Nicole
for
an
enemy
.
``
But
you
did
n't
see
the
fight
,
''
Nicole
continued
.
``
The
day
before
you
came
,
the
married
man
,
the
one
with
the
name
that
sounds
like
a
substitute
for
gasoline
or
butter
--
''
``
McKisco
?
''
``
Yes
--
well
they
were
having
words
and
she
tossed
some
sand
in
his
face
.
So
naturally
he
sat
on
top
of
her
and
rubbed
her
face
in
the
sand
.
We
were
--
electrified
.
I
wanted
Dick
to
interfere
.
''
``
I
think
,
''
said
Dick
Diver
,
staring
down
abstractedly
at
the
straw
mat
,
``
that
I
'll
go
over
and
invite
them
to
dinner
.
''
``
No
,
you
wo
n't
,
''
Nicole
told
him
quickly
.
``
I
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
.
They
're
here
--
let
's
adjust
ourselves
.
''
``
We
're
very
well
adjusted
,
''
she
insisted
,
laughing
.
``
I
'm
not
going
to
have
my
nose
rubbed
in
the
sand
.
I
'm
a
mean
,
hard
woman
,
''
she
explained
to
Rosemary
,
and
then
raising
her
voice
,
``
Children
,
put
on
your
bathing
suits
!
''
Rosemary
felt
that
this
swim
would
become
the
typical
one
of
her
life
,
the
one
that
would
always
pop
up
in
her
memory
at
the
mention
of
swimming
.
Simultaneously
the
whole
party
moved
toward
the
water
,
super-ready
from
the
long
,
forced
inaction
,
passing
from
the
heat
to
the
cool
with
the
gourmandise
of
a
tingling
curry
eaten
with
chilled
white
wine
.
The
Divers
'
day
was
spaced
like
the
day
of
the
older
civilizations
to
yield
the
utmost
from
the
materials
at
hand
,
and
to
give
all
the
transitions
their
full
value
,
and
she
did
not
know
that
there
would
be
another
transition
presently
from
the
utter
absorption
of
the
swim
to
the
garrulity
of
the
Provençal
lunch
hour
.
But
again
she
had
the
sense
that
Dick
was
taking
care
of
her
,
and
she
delighted
in
responding
to
the
eventual
movement
as
if
it
had
been
an
order
.
Nicole
handed
her
husband
the
curious
garment
on
which
she
had
been
working
.
He
went
into
the
dressing
tent
and
inspired
a
commotion
by
appearing
in
a
moment
clad
in
transparent
black
lace
drawers
.
Close
inspection
revealed
that
actually
they
were
lined
with
flesh-colored
cloth
.
``
Well
,
if
that
is
n't
a
pansys
trick
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
McKisco
contemptuously
--
then
turning
quickly
to
Mr.
Dumphry
and
Mr.
Campion
,
he
added
,
``
Oh
,
I
beg
your
pardon
.
''
Rosemary
bubbled
with
delight
at
the
trunks
.
Her
naïveté
responded
whole-heartedly
to
the
expensive
simplicity
of
the
Divers
,
unaware
of
its
complexity
and
its
lack
of
innocence
,
unaware
that
it
was
all
a
selection
of
quality
rather
than
quantity
from
the
run
of
the
world
's
bazaar
;
and
that
the
simplicity
of
behavior
also
,
the
nursery-like
peace
and
good
will
,
the
emphasis
on
the
simpler
virtues
,
was
part
of
a
desperate
bargain
with
the
gods
and
had
been
attained
through
struggles
she
could
not
have
guessed
at
.
At
that
moment
the
Divers
represented
externally
the
exact
furthermost
evolution
of
a
class
,
so
that
most
people
seemed
awkward
beside
them
--
in
reality
a
qualitative
change
had
already
set
in
that
was
not
at
all
apparent
to
Rosemary
.
She
stood
with
them
as
they
took
sherry
and
ate
crackers
.
Dick
Diver
looked
at
her
with
cold
blue
eyes
;
his
kind
,
strong
mouth
said
thoughtfully
and
deliberately
:
``
You
're
the
only
girl
I
've
seen
for
a
long
time
that
actually
did
look
like
something
blooming
.
''
In
her
mother
's
lap
afterward
Rosemary
cried
and
cried
.
``
I
love
him
,
Mother
.
I
'm
desperately
in
love
with
him
--
I
never
knew
I
could
feel
that
way
about
anybody
.
And
he
's
married
and
I
like
her
too
--
it
's
just
hopeless
.
Oh
,
I
love
him
so
!
''
``
I
'm
curious
to
meet
him
.
''
``
She
invited
us
to
dinner
Friday
.
''
``
If
you
're
in
love
it
ought
to
make
you
happy
.
You
ought
to
laugh
.
''
Rosemary
looked
up
and
gave
a
beautiful
little
shiver
of
her
face
and
laughed
.
Her
mother
always
had
a
great
influence
on
her
.
V
Rosemary
went
to
Monte
Carlo
nearly
as
sulkily
as
it
was
possible
for
her
to
be
.
She
rode
up
the
rugged
hill
to
La
Turbie
,
to
an
old
Gaumont
lot
in
process
of
reconstruction
,
and
as
she
stood
by
the
grilled
entrance
waiting
for
an
answer
to
the
message
on
her
card
,
she
might
have
been
looking
into
Hollywood
.
The
bizarre
débris
of
some
recent
picture
,
a
decayed
street
scene
in
India
,
a
great
cardboard
whale
,
a
monstrous
tree
bearing
cherries
large
as
basketballs
,
bloomed
there
by
exotic
dispensation
,
autochthonous
as
the
pale
amaranth
,
mimosa
,
cork
oak
or
dwarfed
pine
.
There
were
a
quick-lunch
shack
and
two
barnlike
stages
and
everywhere
about
the
lot
,
groups
of
waiting
,
hopeful
,
painted
faces
.
After
ten
minutes
a
young
man
with
hair
the
color
of
canary
feathers
hurried
down
to
the
gate
.
``
Come
in
,
Miss
Hoyt
.
Mr.
Brady
's
on
the
set
,
but
he
's
very
anxious
to
see
you
.
I
'm
sorry
you
were
kept
waiting
,
but
you
know
some
of
these
French
dames
are
worse
about
pushing
themselves
in
--
''
The
studio
manager
opened
a
small
door
in
the
blank
wall
of
stage
building
and
with
sudden
glad
familiarity
Rosemary
followed
him
into
half
darkness
.
Here
and
there
figures
spotted
the
twilight
,
turning
up
ashen
faces
to
her
like
souls
in
purgatory
watching
the
passage
of
a
mortal
through
.
There
were
whispers
and
soft
voices
and
,
apparently
from
afar
,
the
gentle
tremolo
of
a
small
organ
.
Turning
the
corner
made
by
some
flats
,
they
came
upon
the
white
crackling
glow
of
a
stage
,
where
a
French
actor
--
his
shirt
front
,
collar
,
and
cuffs
tinted
a
brilliant
pink
--
and
an
American
actress
stood
motionless
face
to
face
.
They
stared
at
each
other
with
dogged
eyes
,
as
though
they
had
been
in
the
same
position
for
hours
;
and
still
for
a
long
time
nothing
happened
,
no
one
moved
.
A
bank
of
lights
went
off
with
a
savage
hiss
,
went
on
again
;
the
plaintive
tap
of
a
hammer
begged
admission
to
nowhere
in
the
distance
;
a
blue
face
appeared
among
the
blinding
lights
above
,
called
something
unintelligible
into
the
upper
blackness
.
Then
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
voice
in
front
of
Rosemary
.
``
Baby
,
you
do
n't
take
off
the
stockings
,
you
can
spoil
ten
more
pairs
.
That
dress
is
fifteen
pounds
.
''
Stepping
backward
the
speaker
ran
against
Rosemary
,
whereupon
the
studio
manager
said
,
``
Hey
,
Earl
--
Miss
Hoyt
.
''
They
were
meeting
for
the
first
time
.
Brady
was
quick
and
strenuous
.
As
he
took
her
hand
she
saw
him
look
her
over
from
head
to
foot
,
a
gesture
she
recognized
and
that
made
her
feel
at
home
,
but
gave
her
always
a
faint
feeling
of
superiority
to
whoever
made
it
.
If
her
person
was
property
she
could
exercise
whatever
advantage
was
inherent
in
its
ownership
.
``
I
thought
you
'd
be
along
any
day
now
,
''
Brady
said
,
in
a
voice
that
was
just
a
little
too
compelling
for
private
life
,
and
that
trailed
with
it
a
faintly
defiant
cockney
accent
.
``
Have
a
good
trip
?
''
``
Yes
,
but
we
're
glad
to
be
going
home
.
''
``
No-o-o
!
''
he
protested
.
``
Stay
awhile
--
I
want
to
talk
to
you
.
Let
me
tell
you
that
was
some
picture
of
yours
--
that
'Daddy
's
Girl
.
'
I
saw
it
in
Paris
.
I
wired
the
coast
right
away
to
see
if
you
were
signed
.
''
``
I
just
had
--
I
'm
sorry
.
''
``
God
,
what
a
picture
!
''
Not
wanting
to
smile
in
silly
agreement
Rosemary
frowned
.
``
Nobody
wants
to
be
thought
of
forever
for
just
one
picture
,
''
she
said
.
``
Sure
--
that
's
right
.
What
're
your
plans
?
''
``
Mother
thought
I
needed
a
rest
.
When
I
get
back
we
'll
probably
either
sign
up
with
First
National
or
keep
on
with
Famous
.
''
``
Who
's
we
?
''
``
My
mother
.
She
decides
business
matters
.
I
could
n't
do
without
her
.
''
Again
he
looked
her
over
completely
,
and
,
as
he
did
,
something
in
Rosemary
went
out
to
him
.
It
was
not
liking
,
not
at
all
the
spontaneous
admiration
she
had
felt
for
the
man
on
the
beach
this
morning
.
It
was
a
click
.
He
desired
her
and
,
so
far
as
her
virginal
emotions
went
,
she
contemplated
a
surrender
with
equanimity
.
Yet
she
knew
she
would
forget
him
half
an
hour
after
she
left
him
--
like
an
actor
kissed
in
a
picture
.
``
Where
are
you
staying
?
''
Brady
asked
.
``
Oh
,
yes
,
at
Gausse
's
.
Well
,
my
plans
are
made
for
this
year
,
too
,
but
that
letter
I
wrote
you
still
stands
.
Rather
make
a
picture
with
you
than
any
girl
since
Connie
Talmadge
was
a
kid
.
''
``
I
feel
the
same
way
.
Why
do
n't
you
come
back
to
Hollywood
?
''
``
I
ca
n't
stand
the
damn
place
.
I
'm
fine
here
.
Wait
till
after
this
shot
and
I
'll
show
you
around
.
''
Walking
onto
the
set
he
began
to
talk
to
the
French
actor
in
a
low
,
quiet
voice
.
Five
minutes
passed
--
Brady
talked
on
,
while
from
time
to
time
the
Frenchman
shifted
his
feet
and
nodded
.
Abruptly
,
Brady
broke
off
,
calling
something
to
the
lights
that
startled
them
into
a
humming
glare
.
Los
Angeles
was
loud
about
Rosemary
now
.
Unappalled
she
moved
once
more
through
the
city
of
thin
partitions
,
wanting
to
be
back
there
.
But
she
did
not
want
to
see
Brady
in
the
mood
she
sensed
he
would
be
in
after
he
had
finished
and
she
left
the
lot
with
a
spell
still
upon
her
.
The
Mediterranean
world
was
less
silent
now
that
she
knew
the
studio
was
there
.
She
liked
the
people
on
the
streets
and
bought
herself
a
pair
of
espadrilles
on
the
way
to
the
train
.
Her
mother
was
pleased
that
she
had
done
so
accurately
what
she
was
told
to
do
,
but
she
still
wanted
to
launch
her
out
and
away
.
Mrs.
Speers
was
fresh
in
appearance
but
she
was
tired
;
death
beds
make
people
tired
indeed
and
she
had
watched
beside
a
couple
.
VI
Feeling
good
from
the
rosy
wine
at
lunch
,
Nicole
Diver
folded
her
arms
high
enough
for
the
artificial
camellia
on
her
shoulder
to
touch
her
cheek
,
and
went
out
into
her
lovely
grassless
garden
.
The
garden
was
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
house
,
from
which
it
flowed
and
into
which
it
ran
,
on
two
sides
by
the
old
village
,
and
on
the
last
by
the
cliff
falling
by
ledges
to
the
sea
.
Along
the
walls
on
the
village
side
all
was
dusty
,
the
wriggling
vines
,
the
lemon
and
eucalyptus
trees
,
the
casual
wheel-barrow
,
left
only
a
moment
since
,
but
already
grown
into
the
path
,
atrophied
and
faintly
rotten
.
Nicole
was
invariably
somewhat
surprised
that
by
turning
in
the
other
direction
past
a
bed
of
peonies
she
walked
into
an
area
so
green
and
cool
that
the
leaves
and
petals
were
curled
with
tender
damp
.
Knotted
at
her
throat
she
wore
a
lilac
scarf
that
even
in
the
achromatic
sunshine
cast
its
color
up
to
her
face
and
down
around
her
moving
feet
in
a
lilac
shadow
.
Her
face
was
hard
,
almost
stern
,
save
for
the
soft
gleam
of
piteous
doubt
that
looked
from
her
green
eyes
.
Her
once
fair
hair
had
darkened
,
but
she
was
lovelier
now
at
twenty-four
than
she
had
been
at
eighteen
,
when
her
hair
was
brighter
than
she
.
Following
a
walk
marked
by
an
intangible
mist
of
bloom
that
followed
the
white
border
stones
she
came
to
a
space
overlooking
the
sea
where
there
were
lanterns
asleep
in
the
fig
trees
and
a
big
table
and
wicker
chairs
and
a
great
market
umbrella
from
Sienna
,
all
gathered
about
an
enormous
pine
,
the
biggest
tree
in
the
garden
.
She
paused
there
a
moment
,
looking
absently
at
a
growth
of
nasturtiums
and
iris
tangled
at
its
foot
,
as
though
sprung
from
a
careless
handful
of
seeds
,
listening
to
the
plaints
and
accusations
of
some
nursery
squabble
in
the
house
.
When
this
died
away
on
the
summer
air
,
she
walked
on
,
between
kaleidoscopic
peonies
massed
in
pink
clouds
,
black
and
brown
tulips
and
fragile
mauve-stemmed
roses
,
transparent
like
sugar
flowers
in
a
confectioner
's
window
--
until
,
as
if
the
scherzo
of
color
could
reach
no
further
intensity
,
it
broke
off
suddenly
in
mid-air
,
and
moist
steps
went
down
to
a
level
five
feet
below
.
Here
there
was
a
well
with
the
boarding
around
it
dank
and
slippery
even
on
the
brightest
days
.
She
went
up
the
stairs
on
the
other
side
and
into
the
vegetable
garden
;
she
walked
rather
quickly
;
she
liked
to
be
active
,
though
at
times
she
gave
an
impression
of
repose
that
was
at
once
static
and
evocative
.
This
was
because
she
knew
few
words
and
believed
in
none
,
and
in
the
world
she
was
rather
silent
,
contributing
just
her
share
of
urbane
humor
with
a
precision
that
approached
meagreness
.
But
at
the
moment
when
strangers
tended
to
grow
uncomfortable
in
the
presence
of
this
economy
she
would
seize
the
topic
and
rush
off
with
it
,
feverishly
surprised
with
herself
--
then
bring
it
back
and
relinquish
it
abruptly
,
almost
timidly
,
like
an
obedient
retriever
,
having
been
adequate
and
something
more
.
As
she
stood
in
the
fuzzy
green
light
of
the
vegetable
garden
,
Dick
crossed
the
path
ahead
of
her
going
to
his
work
house
.
Nicole
waited
silently
till
he
had
passed
;
then
she
went
on
through
lines
of
prospective
salads
to
a
little
menagerie
where
pigeons
and
rabbits
and
a
parrot
made
a
medley
of
insolent
noises
at
her
.
Descending
to
another
ledge
she
reached
a
low
,
curved
wall
and
looked
down
seven
hundred
feet
to
the
Mediterranean
Sea
.
She
stood
in
the
ancient
hill
village
of
Tarmes
.
The
villa
and
its
grounds
were
made
out
of
a
row
of
peasant
dwellings
that
abutted
on
the
cliff
--
five
small
houses
had
been
combined
to
make
the
house
and
four
destroyed
to
make
the
garden
.
The
exterior
walls
were
untouched
so
that
from
the
road
far
below
it
was
indistinguishable
from
the
violet
gray
mass
of
the
town
.
For
a
moment
Nicole
stood
looking
down
at
the
Mediterranean
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
with
that
,
even
with
her
tireless
hands
.
Presently
Dick
came
out
of
his
one-room
house
carrying
a
telescope
and
looked
east
toward
Cannes
.
In
a
moment
Nicole
swam
into
his
field
of
vision
,
whereupon
he
disappeared
into
his
house
and
came
out
with
a
megaphone
.
He
had
many
light
mechanical
devices
.
``
Nicole
,
''
he
shouted
,
``
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
as
a
final
apostolic
gesture
I
invited
Mrs.
Abrams
,
the
woman
with
the
white
hair
.
''
``
I
suspected
it
.
It
's
an
outrage
.
''
The
ease
with
which
her
reply
reached
him
seemed
to
belittle
his
megaphone
,
so
she
raised
her
voice
and
called
,
``
Can
you
hear
me
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
He
lowered
the
megaphone
and
then
raised
it
stubbornly
.
``
I
'm
going
to
invite
some
more
people
too
.
I
'm
going
to
invite
the
two
young
men
.
''
``
All
right
,
''
she
agreed
placidly
.
``
I
want
to
give
a
really
bad
party
.
I
mean
it
.
I
want
to
give
a
party
where
there
's
a
brawl
and
seductions
and
people
going
home
with
their
feelings
hurt
and
women
passed
out
in
the
cabinet
de
toilette
.
You
wait
and
see
.
''
He
went
back
into
his
house
and
Nicole
saw
that
one
of
his
most
characteristic
moods
was
upon
him
,
the
excitement
that
swept
everyone
up
into
it
and
was
inevitably
followed
by
his
own
form
of
melancholy
,
which
he
never
displayed
but
at
which
she
guessed
.
This
excitement
about
things
reached
an
intensity
out
of
proportion
to
their
importance
,
generating
a
really
extraordinary
virtuosity
with
people
.
Save
among
a
few
of
the
tough-minded
and
perennially
suspicious
,
he
had
the
power
of
arousing
a
fascinated
and
uncritical
love
.
The
reaction
came
when
he
realized
the
waste
and
extravagance
involved
.
He
sometimes
looked
back
with
awe
at
the
carnivals
of
affection
he
had
given
,
as
a
general
might
gaze
upon
a
massacre
he
had
ordered
to
satisfy
an
impersonal
blood
lust
.
But
to
be
included
in
Dick
Diver
's
world
for
a
while
was
a
remarkable
experience
:
people
believed
he
made
special
reservations
about
them
,
recognizing
the
proud
uniqueness
of
their
destinies
,
buried
under
the
compromises
of
how
many
years
.
He
won
everyone
quickly
with
an
exquisite
consideration
and
a
politeness
that
moved
so
fast
and
intuitively
that
it
could
be
examined
only
in
its
effect
.
Then
,
without
caution
,
lest
the
first
bloom
of
the
relation
wither
,
he
opened
the
gate
to
his
amusing
world
.
So
long
as
they
subscribed
to
it
completely
,
their
happiness
was
his
preoccupation
,
but
at
the
first
flicker
of
doubt
as
to
its
all-inclusiveness
he
evaporated
before
their
eyes
,
leaving
little
communicable
memory
of
what
he
had
said
or
done
.
At
eight-thirty
that
evening
he
came
out
to
meet
his
first
guests
,
his
coat
carried
rather
ceremoniously
,
rather
promisingly
,
in
his
hand
,
like
a
toreador
's
cape
.
It
was
characteristic
that
after
greeting
Rosemary
and
her
mother
he
waited
for
them
to
speak
first
,
as
if
to
allow
them
the
reassurance
of
their
own
voices
in
new
surroundings
.
To
resume
Rosemary
's
point
of
view
it
should
be
said
that
,
under
the
spell
of
the
climb
to
Tarmes
and
the
fresher
air
,
she
and
her
mother
looked
about
appreciatively
.
Just
as
the
personal
qualities
of
extraordinary
people
can
make
themselves
plain
in
an
unaccustomed
change
of
expression
,
so
the
intensely
calculated
perfection
of
Villa
Diana
transpired
all
at
once
through
such
minute
failures
as
the
chance
apparition
of
a
maid
in
the
background
or
the
perversity
of
a
cork
.
While
the
first
guests
arrived
bringing
with
them
the
excitement
of
the
night
,
the
domestic
activity
of
the
day
receded
past
them
gently
,
symbolized
by
the
Diver
children
and
their
governess
still
at
supper
on
the
terrace
.
``
What
a
beautiful
garden
!
''
Mrs.
Speers
exclaimed
.
``
Nicole
's
garden
,
''
said
Dick
.
``
She
wo
n't
let
it
alone
--
she
nags
it
all
the
time
,
worries
about
its
diseases
.
Any
day
now
I
expect
to
have
her
come
down
with
Powdery
Mildew
or
Fly
Speck
,
or
Late
Blight
.
''
He
pointed
his
forefinger
decisively
at
Rosemary
,
saying
with
a
lightness
seeming
to
conceal
a
paternal
interest
,
``
I
'm
going
to
save
your
reason
--
I
'm
going
to
give
you
a
hat
to
wear
on
the
beach
.
''
He
turned
them
from
the
garden
to
the
terrace
,
where
he
poured
a
cocktail
.
Earl
Brady
arrived
,
discovering
Rosemary
with
surprise
.
His
manner
was
softer
than
at
the
studio
,
as
if
his
differentness
had
been
put
on
at
the
gate
,
and
Rosemary
,
comparing
him
instantly
with
Dick
Diver
,
swung
sharply
toward
the
latter
.
In
comparison
Earl
Brady
seemed
faintly
gross
,
faintly
ill-bred
;
once
more
,
though
,
she
felt
an
electric
response
to
his
person
.
He
spoke
familiarly
to
the
children
who
were
getting
up
from
their
outdoor
supper
.
``
Hello
,
Lanier
,
how
about
a
song
?
Will
you
and
Topsy
sing
me
a
song
?
''
``
What
shall
we
sing
?
''
agreed
the
little
boy
,
with
the
odd
chanting
accent
of
American
children
brought
up
in
France
.
``
That
song
about
'Mon
Ami
Pierrot
.
'
''
Brother
and
sister
stood
side
by
side
without
self-consciousness
and
their
voices
soared
sweet
and
shrill
upon
the
evening
air
.
``
Au
clair
de
la
lune
Mon
Ami
Pierrot
Prête-moi
ta
plume
Pour
écrire
un
mot
Ma
chandelle
est
morte
Je
n'ai
plus
de
feu
Ouvre-moi
ta
porte
Pour
l'amour
de
Dieu
.
''
The
singing
ceased
and
the
children
,
their
faces
aglow
with
the
late
sunshine
,
stood
smiling
calmly
at
their
success
.
Rosemary
was
thinking
that
the
Villa
Diana
was
the
centre
of
the
world
.
On
such
a
stage
some
memorable
thing
was
sure
to
happen
.
She
lighted
up
higher
as
the
gate
tinkled
open
and
the
rest
of
the
guests
arrived
in
a
body
--
the
McKiscos
,
Mrs.
Abrams
,
Mr.
Dumphry
,
and
Mr.
Campion
came
up
to
the
terrace
.
Rosemary
had
a
sharp
feeling
of
disappointment
--
she
looked
quickly
at
Dick
,
as
though
to
ask
an
explanation
of
this
incongruous
mingling
.
But
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
his
expression
.
He
greeted
his
new
guests
with
a
proud
bearing
and
an
obvious
deference
to
their
infinite
and
unknown
possibilities
.
She
believed
in
him
so
much
that
presently
she
accepted
the
rightness
of
the
McKiscos
'
presence
as
if
she
had
expected
to
meet
them
all
along
.
``
I
've
met
you
in
Paris
,
''
McKisco
said
to
Abe
North
,
who
with
his
wife
had
arrived
on
their
heels
,
``
in
fact
I
've
met
you
twice
.
''
``
Yes
,
I
remember
,
''
Abe
said
.
``
Then
where
was
it
?
''
demanded
McKisco
,
not
content
to
let
well
enough
alone
.
``
Why
,
I
think
--
''
Abe
got
tired
of
the
game
,
``
I
ca
n't
remember
.
''
The
interchange
filled
a
pause
and
Rosemary
's
instinct
was
that
something
tactful
should
be
said
by
somebody
,
but
Dick
made
no
attempt
to
break
up
the
grouping
formed
by
these
late
arrivals
,
not
even
to
disarm
Mrs.
McKisco
of
her
air
of
supercilious
amusement
.
He
did
not
solve
this
social
problem
because
he
knew
it
was
not
of
importance
at
the
moment
and
would
solve
itself
.
He
was
saving
his
newness
for
a
larger
effort
,
waiting
a
more
significant
moment
for
his
guests
to
be
conscious
of
a
good
time
.
Rosemary
stood
beside
Tommy
Barban
--
he
was
in
a
particularly
scornful
mood
and
there
seemed
to
be
some
special
stimulus
working
upon
him
.
He
was
leaving
in
the
morning
.
``
Going
home
?
''
``
Home
?
I
have
no
home
.
I
am
going
to
a
war
.
''
``
What
war
?
''
``
What
war
?
Any
war
.
I
have
n't
seen
a
paper
lately
but
I
suppose
there
's
a
war
--
there
always
is
.
''
``
Do
n't
you
care
what
you
fight
for
?
''
``
Not
at
all
--
so
long
as
I
'm
well
treated
.
When
I
'm
in
a
rut
I
come
to
see
the
Divers
,
because
then
I
know
that
in
a
few
weeks
I
'll
want
to
go
to
war
.
''
Rosemary
stiffened
.
``
You
like
the
Divers
,
''
she
reminded
him
.
``
Of
course
--
especially
her
--
but
they
make
me
want
to
go
to
war
.
''
She
considered
this
,
to
no
avail
.
The
Divers
made
her
want
to
stay
near
them
forever
.
``
You
're
half
American
,
''
she
said
,
as
if
that
should
solve
the
problem
.
``
Also
I
'm
half
French
,
and
I
was
educated
in
England
and
since
I
was
eighteen
I
've
worn
the
uniforms
of
eight
countries
.
But
I
hope
I
did
not
give
you
the
impression
that
I
am
not
fond
of
the
Divers
--
I
am
,
especially
of
Nicole
.
''
``
How
could
any
one
help
it
?
''
she
said
simply
.
She
felt
far
from
him
.
The
undertone
of
his
words
repelled
her
and
she
withdrew
her
adoration
for
the
Divers
from
the
profanity
of
his
bitterness
.
She
was
glad
he
was
not
next
to
her
at
dinner
and
she
was
still
thinking
of
his
words
``
especially
her
''
as
they
moved
toward
the
table
in
the
garden
.
For
a
moment
now
she
was
beside
Dick
Diver
on
the
path
.
Alongside
his
hard
,
neat
brightness
everything
faded
into
the
surety
that
he
knew
everything
.
For
a
year
,
which
was
forever
,
she
had
had
money
and
a
certain
celebrity
and
contact
with
the
celebrated
,
and
these
latter
had
presented
themselves
merely
as
powerful
enlargements
of
the
people
with
whom
the
doctor
's
widow
and
her
daughter
had
associated
in
a
hôtel-pension
in
Paris
.
Rosemary
was
a
romantic
and
her
career
had
not
provided
many
satisfactory
opportunities
on
that
score
.
Her
mother
,
with
the
idea
of
a
career
for
Rosemary
,
would
not
tolerate
any
such
spurious
substitutes
as
the
excitations
available
on
all
sides
,
and
indeed
Rosemary
was
already
beyond
that
--
she
was
In
the
movies
but
not
at
all
At
them
.
So
when
she
had
seen
approval
of
Dick
Diver
in
her
mother
's
face
it
meant
that
he
was
``
the
real
thing
''
;
it
meant
permission
to
go
as
far
as
she
could
.
``
I
was
watching
you
,
''
he
said
,
and
she
knew
he
meant
it
.
``
We
've
grown
very
fond
of
you
.
''
``
I
fell
in
love
with
you
the
first
time
I
saw
you
,
''
she
said
quietly
.
He
pretended
not
to
have
heard
,
as
if
the
compliment
were
purely
formal
.
``
New
friends
,
''
he
said
,
as
if
it
were
an
important
point
,
``
can
often
have
a
better
time
together
than
old
friends
.
''
With
that
remark
,
which
she
did
not
understand
precisely
,
she
found
herself
at
the
table
,
picked
out
by
slowly
emerging
lights
against
the
dark
dusk
.
A
chord
of
delight
struck
inside
her
when
she
saw
that
Dick
had
taken
her
mother
on
his
right
hand
;
for
herself
she
was
between
Luis
Campion
and
Brady
.
Surcharged
with
her
emotion
she
turned
to
Brady
with
the
intention
of
confiding
in
him
,
but
at
her
first
mention
of
Dick
a
hard-boiled
sparkle
in
his
eyes
gave
her
to
understand
that
he
refused
the
fatherly
office
.
In
turn
she
was
equally
firm
when
he
tried
to
monopolize
her
hand
,
so
they
talked
shop
or
rather
she
listened
while
he
talked
shop
,
her
polite
eyes
never
leaving
his
face
,
but
her
mind
was
so
definitely
elsewhere
that
she
felt
he
must
guess
the
fact
.
Intermittently
she
caught
the
gist
of
his
sentences
and
supplied
the
rest
from
her
subconscious
,
as
one
picks
up
the
striking
of
a
clock
in
the
middle
with
only
the
rhythm
of
the
first
uncounted
strokes
lingering
in
the
mind
.
VII
In
a
pause
Rosemary
looked
away
and
up
the
table
where
Nicole
sat
between
Tommy
Barban
and
Abe
North
,
her
chow
's
hair
foaming
and
frothing
in
the
candlelight
.
Rosemary
listened
,
caught
sharply
by
the
rich
clipped
voice
in
infrequent
speech
:
``
The
poor
man
,
''
Nicole
exclaimed
.
``
Why
did
you
want
to
saw
him
in
two
?
''
``
Naturally
I
wanted
to
see
what
was
inside
a
waiter
.
Would
n't
you
like
to
know
what
was
inside
a
waiter
?
''
``
Old
menus
,
''
suggested
Nicole
with
a
short
laugh
.
``
Pieces
of
broken
china
and
tips
and
pencil
stubs
.
''
``
Exactly
--
but
the
thing
was
to
prove
it
scientifically
.
And
of
course
doing
it
with
that
musical
saw
would
have
eliminated
any
sordidness
.
''
``
Did
you
intend
to
play
the
saw
while
you
performed
the
operation
?
''
Tommy
inquired
.
``
We
did
n't
get
quite
that
far
.
We
were
alarmed
by
the
screams
.
We
thought
he
might
rupture
something
.
''
``
All
sounds
very
peculiar
to
me
,
''
said
Nicole
.
``
Any
musician
that
'll
use
another
musician
's
saw
to
--
''
They
had
been
at
table
half
an
hour
and
a
perceptible
change
had
set
in
--
person
by
person
had
given
up
something
,
a
preoccupation
,
an
anxiety
,
a
suspicion
,
and
now
they
were
only
their
best
selves
and
the
Divers
'
guests
.
Not
to
have
been
friendly
and
interested
would
have
seemed
to
reflect
on
the
Divers
,
so
now
they
were
all
trying
,
and
seeing
this
,
Rosemary
liked
everyone
--
except
McKisco
,
who
had
contrived
to
be
the
unassimilated
member
of
the
party
.
This
was
less
from
ill
will
than
from
his
determination
to
sustain
with
wine
the
good
spirits
he
had
enjoyed
on
his
arrival
.
Lying
back
in
his
place
between
Earl
Brady
,
to
whom
he
had
addressed
several
withering
remarks
about
the
movies
,
and
Mrs.
Abrams
,
to
whom
he
said
nothing
,
he
stared
at
Dick
Diver
with
an
expression
of
devastating
irony
,
the
effect
being
occasionally
interrupted
by
his
attempts
to
engage
Dick
in
a
cater-cornered
conversation
across
the
table
.
``
Are
n't
you
a
friend
of
Van
Buren
Denby
?
''
he
would
say
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
I
know
him
.
''
``
I
thought
you
were
a
friend
of
his
,
''
he
persisted
irritably
.
When
the
subject
of
Mr.
Denby
fell
of
its
own
weight
,
he
essayed
other
equally
irrelative
themes
,
but
each
time
the
very
deference
of
Dick
's
attention
seemed
to
paralyze
him
,
and
after
a
moment
's
stark
pause
the
conversation
that
he
had
interrupted
would
go
on
without
him
.
He
tried
breaking
into
other
dialogues
,
but
it
was
like
continually
shaking
hands
with
a
glove
from
which
the
hand
had
been
withdrawn
--
so
finally
,
with
a
resigned
air
of
being
among
children
,
he
devoted
his
attention
entirely
to
the
champagne
.
Rosemary
's
glance
moved
at
intervals
around
the
table
,
eager
for
the
others
'
enjoyment
,
as
if
they
were
her
future
stepchildren
.
A
gracious
table
light
,
emanating
from
a
bowl
of
spicy
pinks
,
fell
upon
Mrs.
Abrams
'
face
,
cooked
to
a
turn
in
Veuve
Cliquot
,
full
of
vigor
,
tolerance
,
adolescent
good
will
;
next
to
her
sat
Mr.
Royal
Dumphry
,
his
girl
's
comeliness
less
startling
in
the
pleasure
world
of
evening
.
Then
Violet
McKisco
,
whose
prettiness
had
been
piped
to
the
surface
of
her
,
so
that
she
ceased
her
struggle
to
make
tangible
to
herself
her
shadowy
position
as
the
wife
of
an
arriviste
who
had
not
arrived
.
Then
came
Dick
,
with
his
arms
full
of
the
slack
he
had
taken
up
from
others
,
deeply
merged
in
his
own
party
.
Then
her
mother
,
forever
perfect
.
Then
Barban
talking
to
her
mother
with
an
urbane
fluency
that
made
Rosemary
like
him
again
.
Then
Nicole
.
Rosemary
saw
her
suddenly
in
a
new
way
and
found
her
one
of
the
most
beautiful
people
she
had
ever
known
.
Her
face
,
the
face
of
a
saint
,
a
viking
Madonna
,
shone
through
the
faint
motes
that
snowed
across
the
candlelight
,
drew
down
its
flush
from
the
wine-colored
lanterns
in
the
pine
.
She
was
still
as
still
.
Abe
North
was
talking
to
her
about
his
moral
code
:
``
Of
course
I
've
got
one
,
''
he
insisted
,
``
--
a
man
ca
n't
live
without
a
moral
code
.
Mine
is
that
I
'm
against
the
burning
of
witches
.
Whenever
they
burn
a
witch
I
get
all
hot
under
the
collar
.
''
Rosemary
knew
from
Brady
that
he
was
a
musician
who
after
a
brilliant
and
precocious
start
had
composed
nothing
for
seven
years
.
Next
was
Campion
,
managing
somehow
to
restrain
his
most
blatant
effeminacy
,
and
even
to
visit
upon
those
near
him
a
certain
disinterested
motherliness
.
Then
Mary
North
with
a
face
so
merry
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
smile
back
into
the
white
mirrors
of
her
teeth
--
the
whole
area
around
her
parted
lips
was
a
lovely
little
circle
of
delight
.
Finally
Brady
,
whose
heartiness
became
,
moment
by
moment
,
a
social
thing
instead
of
a
crude
assertion
and
reassertion
of
his
own
mental
health
,
and
his
preservation
of
it
by
a
detachment
from
the
frailties
of
others
.
Rosemary
,
as
dewy
with
belief
as
a
child
from
one
of
Mrs.
Burnett
's
vicious
tracts
,
had
a
conviction
of
homecoming
,
of
a
return
from
the
derisive
and
salacious
improvisations
of
the
frontier
.
There
were
fireflies
riding
on
the
dark
air
and
a
dog
baying
on
some
low
and
far-away
ledge
of
the
cliff
.
The
table
seemed
to
have
risen
a
little
toward
the
sky
like
a
mechanical
dancing
platform
,
giving
the
people
around
it
a
sense
of
being
alone
with
each
other
in
the
dark
universe
,
nourished
by
its
only
food
,
warmed
by
its
only
lights
.
And
,
as
if
a
curious
hushed
laugh
from
Mrs.
McKisco
were
a
signal
that
such
a
detachment
from
the
world
had
been
attained
,
the
two
Divers
began
suddenly
to
warm
and
glow
and
expand
,
as
if
to
make
up
to
their
guests
,
already
so
subtly
assured
of
their
importance
,
so
flattered
with
politeness
,
for
anything
they
might
still
miss
from
that
country
well
left
behind
.
Just
for
a
moment
they
seemed
to
speak
to
every
one
at
the
table
,
singly
and
together
,
assuring
them
of
their
friendliness
,
their
affection
.
And
for
a
moment
the
faces
turned
up
toward
them
were
like
the
faces
of
poor
children
at
a
Christmas
tree
.
Then
abruptly
the
table
broke
up
--
the
moment
when
the
guests
had
been
daringly
lifted
above
conviviality
into
the
rarer
atmosphere
of
sentiment
,
was
over
before
it
could
be
irreverently
breathed
,
before
they
had
half
realized
it
was
there
.
But
the
diffused
magic
of
the
hot
sweet
South
had
withdrawn
into
them
--
the
soft-pawed
night
and
the
ghostly
wash
of
the
Mediterranean
far
below
--
the
magic
left
these
things
and
melted
into
the
two
Divers
and
became
part
of
them
.
Rosemary
watched
Nicole
pressing
upon
her
mother
a
yellow
evening
bag
she
had
admired
,
saying
,
``
I
think
things
ought
to
belong
to
the
people
that
like
them
''
--
and
then
sweeping
into
it
all
the
yellow
articles
she
could
find
,
a
pencil
,
a
lipstick
,
a
little
note
book
,
``
because
they
all
go
together
.
''
Nicole
disappeared
and
presently
Rosemary
noticed
that
Dick
was
no
longer
there
;
the
guests
distributed
themselves
in
the
garden
or
drifted
in
toward
the
terrace
.
``
Do
you
want
,
''
Violet
McKisco
asked
Rosemary
,
``
to
go
to
the
bathroom
?
''
Not
at
that
precise
moment
.
``
I
want
,
''
insisted
Mrs.
McKisco
,
``
to
go
to
the
bathroom
.
''
As
a
frank
outspoken
woman
she
walked
toward
the
house
,
dragging
her
secret
after
her
,
while
Rosemary
looked
after
with
reprobation
.
Earl
Brady
proposed
that
they
walk
down
to
the
sea
wall
but
she
felt
that
this
was
her
time
to
have
a
share
of
Dick
Diver
when
he
reappeared
,
so
she
stalled
,
listening
to
McKisco
quarrel
with
Barban
.
``
Why
do
you
want
to
fight
the
Soviets
?
''
McKisco
said
.
``
The
greatest
experiment
ever
made
by
humanity
?
And
the
Riff
?
It
seems
to
me
it
would
be
more
heroic
to
fight
on
the
just
side
.
''
``
How
do
you
find
out
which
it
is
?
''
asked
Barban
dryly
.
``
Why
--
usually
everybody
intelligent
knows
.
''
``
Are
you
a
Communist
?
''
``
I
'm
a
Socialist
,
''
said
McKisco
,
``
I
sympathize
with
Russia
.
''
``
Well
,
I
'm
a
soldier
,
''
Barban
answered
pleasantly
.
``
My
business
is
to
kill
people
.
I
fought
against
the
Riff
because
I
am
a
European
,
and
I
have
fought
the
Communists
because
they
want
to
take
my
property
from
me
.
''
``
Of
all
the
narrow-minded
excuses
,
''
McKisco
looked
around
to
establish
a
derisive
liaison
with
some
one
else
,
but
without
success
.
He
had
no
idea
what
he
was
up
against
in
Barban
,
neither
of
the
simplicity
of
the
other
man
's
bag
of
ideas
nor
of
the
complexity
of
his
training
.
McKisco
knew
what
ideas
were
,
and
as
his
mind
grew
he
was
able
to
recognize
and
sort
an
increasing
number
of
them
--
but
faced
by
a
man
whom
he
considered
``
dumb
,
''
one
in
whom
he
found
no
ideas
he
could
recognize
as
such
,
and
yet
to
whom
he
could
not
feel
personally
superior
,
he
jumped
at
the
conclusion
that
Barban
was
the
end
product
of
an
archaic
world
,
and
as
such
,
worthless
.
McKisco
's
contacts
with
the
princely
classes
in
America
had
impressed
upon
him
their
uncertain
and
fumbling
snobbery
,
their
delight
in
ignorance
and
their
deliberate
rudeness
,
all
lifted
from
the
English
with
no
regard
paid
to
factors
that
make
English
philistinism
and
rudeness
purposeful
,
and
applied
in
a
land
where
a
little
knowledge
and
civility
buy
more
than
they
do
anywhere
else
--
an
attitude
which
reached
its
apogee
in
the
``
Harvard
manner
''
of
about
1900
.
He
thought
that
this
Barban
was
of
that
type
,
and
being
drunk
rashly
forgot
that
he
was
in
awe
of
him
--
this
led
up
to
the
trouble
in
which
he
presently
found
himself
.
Feeling
vaguely
ashamed
for
McKisco
,
Rosemary
waited
,
placid
but
inwardly
on
fire
,
for
Dick
Diver
's
return
.
From
her
chair
at
the
deserted
table
with
Barban
,
McKisco
,
and
Abe
she
looked
up
along
the
path
edged
with
shadowy
myrtle
and
fern
to
the
stone
terrace
,
and
falling
in
love
with
her
mother
's
profile
against
a
lighted
door
,
was
about
to
go
there
when
Mrs.
McKisco
came
hurrying
down
from
the
house
.
She
exuded
excitement
.
In
the
very
silence
with
which
she
pulled
out
a
chair
and
sat
down
,
her
eyes
staring
,
her
mouth
working
a
little
,
they
all
recognized
a
person
crop-full
of
news
,
and
her
husband
's
``
What
's
the
matter
,
Vi
?
''
came
naturally
,
as
all
eyes
turned
toward
her
.
``
My
dear
--
''
she
said
at
large
,
and
then
addressed
Rosemary
,
``
my
dear
--
it
's
nothing
.
I
really
ca
n't
say
a
word
.
''
``
You
're
among
friends
,
''
said
Abe
.
``
Well
,
upstairs
I
came
upon
a
scene
,
my
dears
--
''
Shaking
her
head
cryptically
she
broke
off
just
in
time
,
for
Tommy
arose
and
addressed
her
politely
but
sharply
:
``
It
's
inadvisable
to
comment
on
what
goes
on
in
this
house
.
''
VIII
Violet
breathed
loud
and
hard
once
and
with
an
effort
brought
another
expression
into
her
face
.
Dick
came
finally
and
with
a
sure
instinct
he
separated
Barban
and
the
McKiscos
and
became
excessively
ignorant
and
inquisitive
about
literature
with
McKisco
--
thus
giving
the
latter
the
moment
of
superiority
which
he
required
.
The
others
helped
him
carry
lamps
up
--
who
would
not
be
pleased
at
carrying
lamps
helpfully
through
the
darkness
?
Rosemary
helped
,
meanwhile
responding
patiently
to
Royal
Dumphry
's
inexhaustible
curiosity
about
Hollywood
.
Now
--
she
was
thinking
--
I
've
earned
a
time
alone
with
him
.
He
must
know
that
because
his
laws
are
like
the
laws
Mother
taught
me
.
Rosemary
was
right
--
presently
he
detached
her
from
the
company
on
the
terrace
,
and
they
were
alone
together
,
borne
away
from
the
house
toward
the
seaside
wall
with
what
were
less
steps
than
irregularly
spaced
intervals
through
some
of
which
she
was
pulled
,
through
others
blown
.
They
looked
out
over
the
Mediterranean
.
Far
below
,
the
last
excursion
boat
from
the
Isles
des
Lerins
floated
across
the
bay
like
a
Fourth-of-July
balloon
foot-loose
in
the
heavens
.
Between
the
black
isles
it
floated
,
softly
parting
the
dark
tide
.
``
I
understand
why
you
speak
as
you
do
of
your
mother
,
''
he
said
.
``
Her
attitude
toward
you
is
very
fine
,
I
think
.
She
has
a
sort
of
wisdom
that
's
rare
in
America
.
''
``
Mother
is
perfect
,
''
she
prayed
.
``
I
was
talking
to
her
about
a
plan
I
have
--
she
told
me
that
how
long
you
both
stayed
in
France
depended
on
you
.
''
On
you
,
Rosemary
all
but
said
aloud
.
``
So
since
things
are
over
down
here
--
''
``
Over
?
''
she
inquired
.
``
Well
,
this
is
over
--
this
part
of
the
summer
is
over
.
Last
week
Nicole
's
sister
left
,
to-morrow
Tommy
Barban
leaves
,
Monday
Abe
and
Mary
North
are
leaving
.
Maybe
we
'll
have
more
fun
this
summer
but
this
particular
fun
is
over
.
I
want
it
to
die
violently
instead
of
fading
out
sentimentally
--
that
's
why
I
gave
this
party
.
What
I
'm
coming
to
is
--
Nicole
and
I
are
going
up
to
Paris
to
see
Abe
North
off
for
America
--
I
wonder
if
you
'd
like
to
go
with
us
.
''
``
What
did
Mother
say
?
''
``
She
seemed
to
think
it
would
be
fine
.
She
does
n't
want
to
go
herself
.
She
wants
you
to
go
alone
.
''
``
I
have
n't
seen
Paris
since
I
've
been
grown
,
''
said
Rosemary
.
``
I
'd
love
to
see
it
with
you
.
''
``
That
's
nice
of
you
.
''
Did
she
imagine
that
his
voice
was
suddenly
metallic
?
``
Of
course
we
've
been
excited
about
you
from
the
moment
you
came
on
the
beach
.
That
vitality
,
we
were
sure
it
was
professional
--
especially
Nicole
was
.
It
'd
never
use
itself
up
on
any
one
person
or
group
.
''
Her
instinct
cried
out
to
her
that
he
was
passing
her
along
slowly
toward
Nicole
and
she
put
her
own
brakes
on
,
saying
with
an
equal
harness
:
``
I
wanted
to
know
all
of
you
too
--
especially
you
.
I
told
you
I
fell
in
love
with
you
the
first
time
I
saw
you
.
''
She
was
right
going
at
it
that
way
.
But
the
space
between
heaven
and
earth
had
cooled
his
mind
,
destroyed
the
impulsiveness
that
had
led
him
to
bring
her
here
,
and
made
him
aware
of
the
too
obvious
appeal
,
the
struggle
with
an
unrehearsed
scene
and
unfamiliar
words
.
He
tried
now
to
make
her
want
to
go
back
to
the
house
and
it
was
difficult
,
and
he
did
not
quite
want
to
lose
her
.
She
felt
only
the
draft
blowing
as
he
joked
with
her
good-humoredly
.
``
You
do
n't
know
what
you
want
.
You
go
and
ask
your
mother
what
you
want
.
''
She
was
stricken
.
She
touched
him
,
feeling
the
smooth
cloth
of
his
dark
coat
like
a
chasuble
.
She
seemed
about
to
fall
to
her
knees
--
from
that
position
she
delivered
her
last
shot
.
``
I
think
you
're
the
most
wonderful
person
I
ever
met
--
except
my
mother
.
''
``
You
have
romantic
eyes
.
''
His
laughter
swept
them
on
up
toward
the
terrace
where
he
delivered
her
to
Nicole
.
.
.
.
Too
soon
it
had
become
time
to
go
and
the
Divers
helped
them
all
to
go
quickly
.
In
the
Divers
'
big
Isotta
there
would
be
Tommy
Barban
and
his
baggage
--
he
was
spending
the
night
at
the
hotel
to
catch
an
early
train
--
with
Mrs.
Abrams
,
the
McKiscos
and
Campion
.
Earl
Brady
was
going
to
drop
Rosemary
and
her
mother
on
his
way
to
Monte
Carlo
,
and
Royal
Dumphry
rode
with
them
because
the
Divers
'
car
was
crowded
.
Down
in
the
garden
lanterns
still
glowed
over
the
table
where
they
had
dined
,
as
the
Divers
stood
side
by
side
in
the
gate
,
Nicole
blooming
away
and
filling
the
night
with
graciousness
,
and
Dick
bidding
good-by
to
everyone
by
name
.
To
Rosemary
it
seemed
very
poignant
to
drive
away
and
leave
them
in
their
house
.
Again
she
wondered
what
Mrs.
McKisco
had
seen
in
the
bathroom
.
IX
It
was
a
limpid
black
night
,
hung
as
in
a
basket
from
a
single
dull
star
.
The
horn
of
the
car
ahead
was
muffled
by
the
resistance
of
the
thick
air
.
Brady
's
chauffeur
drove
slowly
;
the
tail-light
of
the
other
car
appeared
from
time
to
time
at
turnings
--
then
not
at
all
.
But
after
ten
minutes
it
came
into
sight
again
,
drawn
up
at
the
side
of
the
road
.
Brady
's
chauffeur
slowed
up
behind
but
immediately
it
began
to
roll
forward
slowly
and
they
passed
it
.
In
the
instant
they
passed
it
they
heard
a
blur
of
voices
from
behind
the
reticence
of
the
limousine
and
saw
that
the
Divers
'
chauffeur
was
grinning
.
Then
they
went
on
,
going
fast
through
the
alternating
banks
of
darkness
and
thin
night
,
descending
at
last
in
a
series
of
roller-coaster
swoops
,
to
the
great
bulk
of
Gausse
's
hotel
.
Rosemary
dozed
for
three
hours
and
then
lay
awake
,
suspended
in
the
moonshine
.
Cloaked
by
the
erotic
darkness
she
exhausted
the
future
quickly
,
with
all
the
eventualities
that
might
lead
up
to
a
kiss
,
but
with
the
kiss
itself
as
blurred
as
a
kiss
in
pictures
.
She
changed
position
in
bed
deliberately
,
the
first
sign
of
insomnia
she
had
ever
had
,
and
tried
to
think
with
her
mother
's
mind
about
the
question
.
In
this
process
she
was
often
acute
beyond
her
experience
,
with
remembered
things
from
old
conversations
that
had
gone
into
her
half-heard
.
Rosemary
had
been
brought
up
with
the
idea
of
work
.
Mrs.
Speers
had
spent
the
slim
leavings
of
the
men
who
had
widowed
her
on
her
daughter
's
education
,
and
when
she
blossomed
out
at
sixteen
with
that
extraordinary
hair
,
rushed
her
to
Aix-les-Bains
and
marched
her
unannounced
into
the
suite
of
an
American
producer
who
was
recuperating
there
.
When
the
producer
went
to
New
York
they
went
too
.
Thus
Rosemary
had
passed
her
entrance
examinations
.
With
the
ensuing
success
and
the
promise
of
comparative
stability
that
followed
,
Mrs.
Speers
had
felt
free
to
tacitly
imply
tonight
:
``
You
were
brought
up
to
work
--
not
especially
to
marry
.
Now
you
've
found
your
first
nut
to
crack
and
it
's
a
good
nut
--
go
ahead
and
put
whatever
happens
down
to
experience
.
Wound
yourself
or
him
--
whatever
happens
it
ca
n't
spoil
you
because
economically
you
're
a
boy
,
not
a
girl
.
''
Rosemary
had
never
done
much
thinking
,
save
about
the
illimitability
of
her
mother
's
perfections
,
so
this
final
severance
of
the
umbilical
cord
disturbed
her
sleep
.
A
false
dawn
sent
the
sky
pressing
through
the
tall
French
windows
,
and
getting
up
she
walked
out
on
the
terrace
,
warm
to
her
bare
feet
.
There
were
secret
noises
in
the
air
,
an
insistent
bird
achieved
an
ill-natured
triumph
with
regularity
in
the
trees
above
the
tennis
court
;
footfalls
followed
a
round
drive
in
the
rear
of
the
hotel
,
taking
their
tone
in
turn
from
the
dust
road
,
the
crushed-stone
walk
,
the
cement
steps
,
and
then
reversing
the
process
in
going
away
.
Beyond
the
inky
sea
and
far
up
that
high
,
black
shadow
of
a
hill
lived
the
Divers
.
She
thought
of
them
both
together
,
heard
them
still
singing
faintly
a
song
like
rising
smoke
,
like
a
hymn
,
very
remote
in
time
and
far
away
.
Their
children
slept
,
their
gate
was
shut
for
the
night
.
She
went
inside
and
dressing
in
a
light
gown
and
espadrilles
went
out
her
window
again
and
along
the
continuous
terrace
toward
the
front
door
,
going
fast
since
she
found
that
other
private
rooms
,
exuding
sleep
,
gave
upon
it
.
She
stopped
at
the
sight
of
a
figure
seated
on
the
wide
white
stairway
of
the
formal
entrance
--
then
she
saw
that
it
was
Luis
Campion
and
that
he
was
weeping
.
He
was
weeping
hard
and
quietly
and
shaking
in
the
same
parts
as
a
weeping
woman
.
A
scene
in
a
role
she
had
played
last
year
swept
over
her
irresistibly
and
advancing
she
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
.
He
gave
a
little
yelp
before
he
recognized
her
.
``
What
is
it
?
''
Her
eyes
were
level
and
kind
and
not
slanted
into
him
with
hard
curiosity
.
``
Can
I
help
you
?
''
``
Nobody
can
help
me
.
I
knew
it
.
I
have
only
myself
to
blame
.
It
's
always
the
same
.
''
``
What
is
it
--
do
you
want
to
tell
me
?
''
He
looked
at
her
to
see
.
``
No
,
''
he
decided
.
``
When
you
're
older
you
'll
know
what
people
who
love
suffer
.
The
agony
.
It
's
better
to
be
cold
and
young
than
to
love
.
It
's
happened
to
me
before
but
never
like
this
--
so
accidental
--
just
when
everything
was
going
well
.
''
His
face
was
repulsive
in
the
quickening
light
.
Not
by
a
flicker
of
her
personality
,
a
movement
of
the
smallest
muscle
,
did
she
betray
her
sudden
disgust
with
whatever
it
was
.
But
Campion
's
sensitivity
realized
it
and
he
changed
the
subject
rather
suddenly
.
``
Abe
North
is
around
here
somewhere
.
''
``
Why
,
he
's
staying
at
the
Divers
'
!
''
``
Yes
,
but
he
's
up
--
do
n't
you
know
what
happened
?
''
A
shutter
opened
suddenly
in
a
room
two
stories
above
and
an
English
voice
spat
distinctly
:
``
Will
you
kaindlay
stup
tucking
!
''
Rosemary
and
Luis
Campion
went
humbly
down
the
steps
and
to
a
bench
beside
the
road
to
the
beach
.
``
Then
you
have
no
idea
what
's
happened
?
My
dear
,
the
most
extraordinary
thing
--
''
He
was
warming
up
now
,
hanging
on
to
his
revelation
.
``
I
've
never
seen
a
thing
come
so
suddenly
--
I
have
always
avoided
violent
people
--
they
upset
me
so
I
sometimes
have
to
go
to
bed
for
days
.
''
He
looked
at
her
triumphantly
.
She
had
no
idea
what
he
was
talking
about
.
``
My
dear
,
''
he
burst
forth
,
leaning
toward
her
with
his
whole
body
as
he
touched
her
on
the
upper
leg
,
to
show
it
was
no
mere
irresponsible
venture
of
his
hand
--
he
was
so
sure
of
himself
.
``
There
's
going
to
be
a
duel
.
''
``
Wh-at
?
''
``
A
duel
with
--
we
do
n't
know
what
yet
.
''
``
Who
's
going
to
duel
?
''
``
I
'll
tell
you
from
the
beginning
.
''
He
drew
a
long
breath
and
then
said
,
as
if
it
were
rather
to
her
discredit
but
he
would
n't
hold
it
against
her
.
``
Of
course
,
you
were
in
the
other
automobile
.
Well
,
in
a
way
you
were
lucky
--
I
lost
at
least
two
years
of
my
life
,
it
came
so
suddenly
.
''
``
What
came
?
''
she
demanded
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
began
it
.
First
she
began
to
talk
--
''
``
Who
?
''
``
Violet
McKisco
.
''
He
lowered
his
voice
as
if
there
were
people
under
the
bench
.
``
But
do
n't
mention
the
Divers
because
he
made
threats
against
anybody
who
mentioned
it
.
''
``
Who
did
?
''
``
Tommy
Barban
,
so
do
n't
you
say
I
so
much
as
mentioned
them
.
None
of
us
ever
found
out
anyhow
what
it
was
Violet
had
to
say
because
he
kept
interrupting
her
,
and
then
her
husband
got
into
it
and
now
,
my
dear
,
we
have
the
duel
.
This
morning
--
at
five
o'clock
--
in
an
hour
.
''
He
sighed
suddenly
thinking
of
his
own
griefs
.
``
I
almost
wish
it
were
I.
I
might
as
well
be
killed
now
I
have
nothing
to
live
for
.
''
He
broke
off
and
rocked
to
and
fro
with
sorrow
.
Again
the
iron
shutter
parted
above
and
the
same
British
voice
said
:
``
Rilly
,
this
must
stup
immejetely
.
''
Simultaneously
Abe
North
,
looking
somewhat
distracted
,
came
out
of
the
hotel
,
perceived
them
against
the
sky
,
white
over
the
sea
.
Rosemary
shook
her
head
warningly
before
he
could
speak
and
they
moved
another
bench
further
down
the
road
.
Rosemary
saw
that
Abe
was
a
little
tight
.
``
What
are
you
doing
up
?
''
he
demanded
.
``
I
just
got
up
.
''
She
started
to
laugh
,
but
remembering
the
voice
above
,
she
restrained
herself
.
``
Plagued
by
the
nightingale
,
''
Abe
suggested
,
and
repeated
,
``
probably
plagued
by
the
nightingale
.
Has
this
sewing-circle
member
told
you
what
happened
?
''
Campion
said
with
dignity
:
``
I
only
know
what
I
heard
with
my
own
ears
.
''
He
got
up
and
walked
swiftly
away
;
Abe
sat
down
beside
Rosemary
.
``
Why
did
you
treat
him
so
badly
?
''
``
Did
I
?
''
he
asked
surprised
.
``
He
's
been
weeping
around
here
all
morning
.
''
``
Well
,
maybe
he
's
sad
about
something
.
''
``
Maybe
he
is
.
''
``
What
about
a
duel
?
Who
's
going
to
duel
?
I
thought
there
was
something
strange
in
that
car
.
Is
it
true
?
''
``
It
certainly
is
coo-coo
but
it
seems
to
be
true
.
''
X
The
trouble
began
at
the
time
Earl
Brady
's
car
passed
the
Divers
'
car
stopped
on
the
road
--
Abe
's
account
melted
impersonally
into
the
thronged
night
--
Violet
McKisco
was
telling
Mrs.
Abrams
something
she
had
found
out
about
the
Divers
--
she
had
gone
upstairs
in
their
house
and
she
had
come
upon
something
there
which
had
made
a
great
impression
on
her
.
But
Tommy
is
a
watch-dog
about
the
Divers
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
she
is
inspiring
and
formidable
--
but
it
's
a
mutual
thing
,
and
the
fact
of
The
Divers
together
is
more
important
to
their
friends
than
many
of
them
realize
.
Of
course
it
's
done
at
a
certain
sacrifice
--
sometimes
they
seem
just
rather
charming
figures
in
a
ballet
,
and
worth
just
the
attention
you
give
a
ballet
,
but
it
's
more
than
that
--
you
'd
have
to
know
the
story
.
Anyhow
Tommy
is
one
of
those
men
that
Dick
's
passed
along
to
Nicole
and
when
Mrs.
McKisco
kept
hinting
at
her
story
,
he
called
them
on
it
.
He
said
:
``
Mrs.
McKisco
,
please
do
n't
talk
further
about
Mrs
.
Diver
.
''
``
I
was
n't
talking
to
you
,
''
she
objected
.
``
I
think
it
's
better
to
leave
them
out
.
''
``
Are
they
so
sacred
?
''
``
Leave
them
out
.
Talk
about
something
else
.
''
He
was
sitting
on
one
of
the
two
little
seats
beside
Campion
.
Campion
told
me
the
story
.
``
Well
,
you
're
pretty
high-handed
,
''
Violet
came
back
.
You
know
how
conversations
are
in
cars
late
at
night
,
some
people
murmuring
and
some
not
caring
,
giving
up
after
the
party
,
or
bored
or
asleep
.
Well
,
none
of
them
knew
just
what
happened
until
the
car
stopped
and
Barban
cried
in
a
voice
that
shook
everybody
,
a
voice
for
cavalry
.
``
Do
you
want
to
step
out
here
--
we
're
only
a
mile
from
the
hotel
and
you
can
walk
it
or
I
'll
drag
you
there
.
You
've
got
to
shut
up
and
shut
your
wife
up
!
''
``
You
're
a
bully
,
''
said
McKisco
.
``
You
know
you
're
stronger
muscularly
than
I
am
.
But
I
'm
not
afraid
of
you
--
what
they
ought
to
have
is
the
code
duello
--
''
There
's
where
he
made
his
mistake
because
Tommy
,
being
French
,
leaned
over
and
clapped
him
one
,
and
then
the
chauffeur
drove
on
.
That
was
where
you
passed
them
.
Then
the
women
began
.
That
was
still
the
state
of
things
when
the
car
got
to
the
hotel
.
Tommy
telephoned
some
man
in
Cannes
to
act
as
second
and
McKisco
said
he
was
n't
going
to
be
seconded
by
Campion
,
who
was
n't
crazy
for
the
job
anyhow
,
so
he
telephoned
me
not
to
say
anything
but
to
come
right
down
.
Violet
McKisco
collapsed
and
Mrs.
Abrams
took
her
to
her
room
and
gave
her
a
bromide
whereupon
she
fell
comfortably
asleep
on
the
bed
.
When
I
got
there
I
tried
to
argue
with
Tommy
but
the
latter
would
n't
accept
anything
short
of
an
apology
and
McKisco
rather
spunkily
would
n't
give
it
.
When
Abe
had
finished
Rosemary
asked
thoughtfully
:
``
Do
the
Divers
know
it
was
about
them
?
''
``
No
--
and
they
're
not
ever
going
to
know
they
had
anything
to
do
with
it
.
That
damn
Campion
had
no
business
talking
to
you
about
it
,
but
since
he
did
--
I
told
the
chauffeur
I
'd
get
out
the
old
musical
saw
if
he
opened
his
mouth
about
it
.
This
fight
's
between
two
men
--
what
Tommy
needs
is
a
good
war
.
''
``
I
hope
the
Divers
do
n't
find
out
,
''
Rosemary
said
.
Abe
peered
at
his
watch
.
``
I
've
got
to
go
up
and
see
McKisco
--
do
you
want
to
come
?
--
he
feels
sort
of
friendless
--
I
bet
he
has
n't
slept
.
''
Rosemary
had
a
vision
of
the
desperate
vigil
that
high-strung
,
badly
organized
man
had
probably
kept
.
After
a
moment
balanced
between
pity
and
repugnance
she
agreed
,
and
full
of
morning
energy
,
bounced
upstairs
beside
Abe
.
McKisco
was
sitting
on
his
bed
with
his
alcoholic
combativeness
vanished
,
in
spite
of
the
glass
of
champagne
in
his
hand
.
He
seemed
very
puny
and
cross
and
white
.
Evidently
he
had
been
writing
and
drinking
all
night
.
He
stared
confusedly
at
Abe
and
Rosemary
and
asked
:
``
Is
it
time
?
''
``
No
,
not
for
half
an
hour
.
''
The
table
was
covered
with
papers
which
he
assembled
with
some
difficulty
into
a
long
letter
;
the
writing
on
the
last
pages
was
very
large
and
illegible
.
In
the
delicate
light
of
electric
lamps
fading
,
he
scrawled
his
name
at
the
bottom
,
crammed
it
into
an
envelope
and
handed
it
to
Abe
.
``
For
my
wife
.
''
``
You
better
souse
your
head
in
cold
water
,
''
Abe
suggested
.
``
You
think
I
'd
better
?
''
inquired
McKisco
doubtfully
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
get
too
sober
.
''
``
Well
,
you
look
terrible
now
.
''
Obediently
McKisco
went
into
the
bathroom
.
``
I
'm
leaving
everything
in
an
awful
mess
,
''
he
called
.
``
I
do
n't
know
how
Violet
will
get
back
to
America
.
I
do
n't
carry
any
insurance
.
I
never
got
around
to
it
.
''
``
Do
n't
talk
nonsense
,
you
'll
be
right
here
eating
breakfast
in
an
hour
.
''
``
Sure
,
I
know
.
''
He
came
back
with
his
hair
wet
and
looked
at
Rosemary
as
if
he
saw
her
for
the
first
time
.
Suddenly
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
.
``
I
never
have
finished
my
novel
.
That
's
what
makes
me
so
sore
.
You
do
n't
like
me
,
''
he
said
to
Rosemary
,
``
but
that
ca
n't
be
helped
.
I
'm
primarily
a
literary
man
.
''
He
made
a
vague
discouraged
sound
and
shook
his
head
helplessly
.
``
I
've
made
lots
of
mistakes
in
my
life
--
many
of
them
.
But
I
've
been
one
of
the
most
prominent
--
in
some
ways
--
''
He
gave
this
up
and
puffed
at
a
dead
cigarette
.
``
I
do
like
you
,
''
said
Rosemary
,
``
but
I
do
n't
think
you
ought
to
fight
a
duel
.
''
``
Yeah
,
I
should
have
tried
to
beat
him
up
,
but
it
's
done
now
.
I
've
let
myself
be
drawn
into
something
that
I
had
no
right
to
be
.
I
have
a
very
violent
temper
--
''
He
looked
closely
at
Abe
as
if
he
expected
the
statement
to
be
challenged
.
Then
with
an
aghast
laugh
he
raised
the
cold
cigarette
butt
toward
his
mouth
.
His
breathing
quickened
.
``
The
trouble
was
I
suggested
the
duel
--
if
Violet
had
only
kept
her
mouth
shut
I
could
have
fixed
it
.
Of
course
even
now
I
can
just
leave
,
or
sit
back
and
laugh
at
the
whole
thing
--
but
I
do
n't
think
Violet
would
ever
respect
me
again
.
''
``
Yes
,
she
would
,
''
said
Rosemary
.
``
She
'd
respect
you
more
.
''
``
No
--
you
do
n't
know
Violet
.
She
's
very
hard
when
she
gets
an
advantage
over
you
.
We
've
been
married
twelve
years
,
we
had
a
little
girl
seven
years
old
and
she
died
and
after
that
you
know
how
it
is
.
We
both
played
around
on
the
side
a
little
,
nothing
serious
but
drifting
apart
--
she
called
me
a
coward
out
there
tonight
.
''
Troubled
,
Rosemary
did
n't
answer
.
``
Well
,
we
'll
see
there
's
as
little
damage
done
as
possible
,
''
said
Abe
.
He
opened
the
leather
case
.
``
These
are
Barban
's
duelling
pistols
--
I
borrowed
them
so
you
could
get
familiar
with
them
.
He
carries
them
in
his
suitcase
.
''
He
weighed
one
of
the
archaic
weapons
in
his
hand
.
Rosemary
gave
an
exclamation
of
uneasiness
and
McKisco
looked
at
the
pistols
anxiously
.
``
Well
--
it
is
n't
as
if
we
were
going
to
stand
up
and
pot
each
other
with
forty-fives
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Abe
cruelly
;
``
the
idea
is
you
can
sight
better
along
a
long
barrel
.
''
``
How
about
distance
?
''
asked
McKisco
.
``
I
've
inquired
about
that
.
If
one
or
the
other
parties
has
to
be
definitely
eliminated
they
make
it
eight
paces
,
if
they
're
just
good
and
sore
it
's
twenty
paces
,
and
if
it
's
only
to
vindicate
their
honor
it
's
forty
paces
.
His
second
agreed
with
me
to
make
it
forty
.
''
``
That
's
good
.
''
``
There
's
a
wonderful
duel
in
a
novel
of
Pushkin
's
,
''
recollected
Abe
.
``
Each
man
stood
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
,
so
if
he
was
hit
at
all
he
was
done
for
.
''
This
seemed
very
remote
and
academic
to
McKisco
,
who
stared
at
him
and
said
,
``
What
?
''
``
Do
you
want
to
take
a
quick
dip
and
freshen
up
?
''
``
No
--
no
,
I
couldn
t
swim
.
''
He
sighed
.
``
I
do
n't
see
what
it
's
all
about
,
''
he
said
helplessly
.
``
I
do
n't
see
why
I
'm
doing
it
.
''
It
was
the
first
thing
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
.
Actually
he
was
one
of
those
for
whom
the
sensual
world
does
not
exist
,
and
faced
with
a
concrete
fact
he
brought
to
it
a
vast
surprise
.
``
We
might
as
well
be
going
,
''
said
Abe
,
seeing
him
fail
a
little
.
``
All
right
.
''
He
drank
off
a
stiff
drink
of
brandy
,
put
the
flask
in
his
pocket
,
and
said
with
almost
a
savage
air
:
``
What
'll
happen
if
I
kill
him
--
will
they
throw
me
in
jail
?
''
``
I
'll
run
you
over
the
Italian
border
.
''
He
glanced
at
Rosemary
--
and
then
said
apologetically
to
Abe
:
``
Before
we
start
there
's
one
thing
I
'd
like
to
see
you
about
alone
.
''
``
I
hope
neither
of
you
gets
hurt
,
''
Rosemary
said
.
``
I
think
it
's
very
foolish
and
you
ought
to
try
to
stop
it
.
''
XI
She
found
Campion
downstairs
in
the
deserted
lobby
.
``
I
saw
you
go
upstairs
,
''
he
said
excitedly
.
``
Is
he
all
right
?
When
is
the
duel
going
to
be
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
She
resented
his
speaking
of
it
as
a
circus
,
with
McKisco
as
the
tragic
clown
.
``
Will
you
go
with
me
?
''
he
demanded
,
with
the
air
of
having
seats
.
``
I
've
hired
the
hotel
car
.
''
``
I
do
n't
want
to
go
.
''
``
Why
not
?
I
imagine
it
'll
take
years
off
my
life
but
I
would
n't
miss
it
for
worlds
.
We
could
watch
it
from
quite
far
away
.
''
``
Why
do
n't
you
get
Mr.
Dumphry
to
go
with
you
?
''
His
monocle
fell
out
,
with
no
whiskers
to
hide
in
--
he
drew
himself
up
.
``
I
never
want
to
see
him
again
.
''
``
Well
,
I
'm
afraid
I
ca
n't
go
.
Mother
would
n't
like
it
.
''
As
Rosemary
entered
her
room
Mrs.
Speers
stirred
sleepily
and
called
to
her
:
``
Where
've
you
been
?
''
``
I
just
could
n't
sleep
.
You
go
back
to
sleep
,
Mother
.
''
``
Come
in
my
room
.
''
Hearing
her
sit
up
in
bed
,
Rosemary
went
in
and
told
her
what
had
happened
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
go
and
see
it
?
''
Mrs.
Speers
suggested
.
``
You
need
n't
go
up
close
and
you
might
be
able
to
help
afterwards
.
''
Rosemary
did
not
like
the
picture
of
herself
looking
on
and
she
demurred
,
but
Mrs.
Speer
's
consciousness
was
still
clogged
with
sleep
and
she
was
reminded
of
night
calls
to
death
and
calamity
when
she
was
the
wife
of
a
doctor
.
``
I
like
you
to
go
places
and
do
things
on
your
own
initiative
without
me
--
you
did
much
harder
things
for
Rainy
's
publicity
stunts
.
''
Still
Rosemary
did
not
see
why
she
should
go
,
but
she
obeyed
the
sure
,
clear
voice
that
had
sent
her
into
the
stage
entrance
of
the
Odeon
in
Paris
when
she
was
twelve
and
greeted
her
when
she
came
out
again
.
She
thought
she
was
reprieved
when
from
the
steps
she
saw
Abe
and
McKisco
drive
away
--
but
after
a
moment
the
hotel
car
came
around
the
corner
.
Squealing
delightedly
Luis
Campion
pulled
her
in
beside
him
.
``
I
hid
there
because
they
might
not
let
us
come
.
I
've
got
my
movie
camera
,
you
see
.
''
She
laughed
helplessly
.
He
was
so
terrible
that
he
was
no
longer
terrible
,
only
dehumanized
.
``
I
wonder
why
Mrs.
McKisco
did
n't
like
the
Divers
?
''
she
said
.
``
They
were
very
nice
to
her
.
''
``
Oh
,
it
was
n't
that
.
It
was
something
she
saw
.
We
never
did
find
exactly
what
it
was
because
of
Barban
.
''
``
Then
that
was
n't
what
made
you
so
sad
.
''
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
he
said
,
his
voice
breaking
,
``
that
was
something
else
that
happened
when
we
got
back
to
the
hotel
.
But
now
I
do
n't
care
--
I
wash
my
hands
of
it
completely
.
''
They
followed
the
other
car
east
along
the
shore
past
Juan
les
Pins
,
where
the
skeleton
of
the
new
Casino
was
rising
.
It
was
past
four
and
under
a
blue-gray
sky
the
first
fishing
boats
were
creaking
out
into
a
glaucous
sea
.
Then
they
turned
off
the
main
road
and
into
the
back
country
.
``
It
's
the
golf
course
,
''
cried
Campion
,
``
I
'm
sure
that
's
where
it
's
going
to
be
.
''
He
was
right
.
When
Abe
's
car
pulled
up
ahead
of
them
the
east
was
crayoned
red
and
yellow
,
promising
a
sultry
day
.
Ordering
the
hotel
car
into
a
grove
of
pines
Rosemary
and
Campion
kept
in
the
shadow
of
a
wood
and
skirted
the
bleached
fairway
where
Abe
and
McKisco
were
walking
up
and
down
,
the
latter
raising
his
head
at
intervals
like
a
rabbit
scenting
.
Presently
there
were
moving
figures
over
by
a
farther
tee
and
the
watchers
made
out
Barban
and
his
French
second
--
the
latter
carried
the
box
of
pistols
under
his
arm
.
Somewhat
appalled
,
McKisco
slipped
behind
Abe
and
took
a
long
swallow
of
brandy
.
He
walked
on
choking
and
would
have
marched
directly
up
into
the
other
party
,
but
Abe
stopped
him
and
went
forward
to
talk
to
the
Frenchman
.
The
sun
was
over
the
horizon
.
Campion
grabbed
Rosemary
's
arm
.
``
I
ca
n't
stand
it
,
''
he
squeaked
,
almost
voiceless
.
``
It
's
too
much
.
This
will
cost
me
--
''
``
Let
go
,
''
Rosemary
said
peremptorily
.
She
breathed
a
frantic
prayer
in
French
.
The
principals
faced
each
other
,
Barban
with
the
sleeve
rolled
up
from
his
arm
.
His
eyes
gleamed
restlessly
in
the
sun
,
but
his
motion
was
deliberate
as
he
wiped
his
palm
on
the
seam
of
his
trousers
.
McKisco
,
reckless
with
brandy
,
pursed
his
lips
in
a
whistle
and
pointed
his
long
nose
about
nonchalantly
,
until
Abe
stepped
forward
with
a
handkerchief
in
his
hand
.
The
French
second
stood
with
his
face
turned
away
.
Rosemary
caught
her
breath
in
terrible
pity
and
gritted
her
teeth
with
hatred
for
Barban
;
then
:
``
One
--
two
--
three
!
''
Abe
counted
in
a
strained
voice
.
They
fired
at
the
same
moment
.
McKisco
swayed
but
recovered
himself
.
Both
shots
had
missed
.
``
Now
,
that
's
enough
!
''
cried
Abe
.
The
duellists
walked
in
,
and
everyone
looked
at
Barban
inquiringly
.
``
I
declare
myself
unsatisfied
.
''
``
What
?
Sure
you
're
satisfied
,
''
said
Abe
impatiently
.
``
You
just
do
n't
know
it
.
''
``
Your
man
refuses
another
shot
?
''
``
You
're
damn
right
,
Tommy
.
You
insisted
on
this
and
my
client
went
through
with
it
.
''
Tommy
laughed
scornfully
.
``
The
distance
was
ridiculous
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'm
not
accustomed
to
such
farces
--
your
man
must
remember
he
's
not
now
in
America
.
''
``
No
use
cracking
at
America
,
''
said
Abe
rather
sharply
.
And
then
,
in
a
more
conciliatory
tone
,
``
This
has
gone
far
enough
,
Tommy
.
''
They
parleyed
briskly
for
a
moment
--
then
Barban
nodded
and
bowed
coldly
to
his
late
antagonist
.
``
No
shake
hand
?
''
suggested
the
French
doctor
.
``
They
already
know
each
other
,
''
said
Abe
.
He
turned
to
McKisco
.
``
Come
on
,
let
's
get
out
.
''
As
they
strode
off
,
McKisco
,
in
exultation
,
gripped
his
arm
.
``
Wait
a
minute
!
''
Abe
said
.
``
Tommy
wants
his
pistol
back
.
He
might
need
it
again
.
''
McKisco
handed
it
over
.
``
To
hell
with
him
,
''
he
said
in
a
tough
voice
.
``
Tell
him
he
can
--
''
``
Shall
I
tell
him
you
want
another
shot
?
''
``
Well
,
I
did
it
,
''
cried
McKisco
,
as
they
went
along
.
``
And
I
did
it
pretty
well
,
did
n't
I
?
I
was
n't
yellow
.
''
``
You
were
pretty
drunk
,
''
said
Abe
bluntly
.
``
No
,
I
was
n't
.
''
``
All
right
,
then
,
you
were
n't
.
''
``
Why
would
it
make
any
difference
if
I
had
a
drink
or
so
?
''
As
his
confidence
mounted
he
looked
resentfully
at
Abe
.
``
What
difference
does
that
make
?
''
he
repeated
.
``
If
you
ca
n't
see
it
,
there
's
no
use
going
into
it
.
''
``
Do
n't
you
know
everybody
was
drunk
all
the
time
during
the
war
?
''
``
Well
,
let
's
forget
it
.
''
But
the
episode
was
not
quite
over
.
There
were
urgent
footsteps
in
the
heather
behind
them
and
the
doctor
drew
up
alongside
.
``
Pardon
,
Messieurs
,
''
he
panted
.
``
Voulez-vous
regler
mes
honorairies
?
Naturellement
c'est
pour
soins
médicaux
seulement
.
M.
Barban
n'a
qu'un
billet
de
mille
et
ne
peut
pas
les
régler
et
l'autre
a
laissé
son
porte-monnaie
chez
lui
.
''
``
Trust
a
Frenchman
to
think
of
that
,
''
said
Abe
,
and
then
to
the
doctor
.
``
Combien
?
''
``
Let
me
pay
this
,
''
said
McKisco
.
``
No
,
I
've
got
it
.
We
were
all
in
about
the
same
danger
.
''
Abe
paid
the
doctor
while
McKisco
suddenly
turned
into
the
bushes
and
was
sick
there
.
Then
paler
than
before
he
strutted
on
with
Abe
toward
the
car
through
the
now
rosy
morning
.
Campion
lay
gasping
on
his
back
in
the
shrubbery
,
the
only
casualty
of
the
duel
,
while
Rosemary
suddenly
hysterical
with
laughter
kept
kicking
at
him
with
her
espadrille
.
She
did
this
persistently
until
she
roused
him
--
the
only
matter
of
importance
to
her
now
was
that
in
a
few
hours
she
would
see
the
person
whom
she
still
referred
to
in
her
mind
as
``
the
Divers
''
on
the
beach
.
XII
They
were
at
Voisins
waiting
for
Nicole
,
six
of
them
,
Rosemary
,
the
Norths
,
Dick
Diver
and
two
young
French
musicians
.
They
were
looking
over
the
other
patrons
of
the
restaurant
to
see
if
they
had
repose
--
Dick
said
no
American
men
had
any
repose
,
except
himself
,
and
they
were
seeking
an
example
to
confront
him
with
.
Things
looked
black
for
them
--
not
a
man
had
come
into
the
restaurant
for
ten
minutes
without
raising
his
hand
to
his
face
.
``
We
ought
never
to
have
given
up
waxed
mustaches
,
''
said
Abe
.
``
Nevertheless
Dick
is
n't
the
only
man
with
repose
--
''
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
am
.
''
``
--
but
he
may
be
the
only
sober
man
with
repose
.
''
A
well-dressed
American
had
come
in
with
two
women
who
swooped
and
fluttered
unselfconsciously
around
a
table
.
Suddenly
,
he
perceived
that
he
was
being
watched
--
whereupon
his
hand
rose
spasmodically
and
arranged
a
phantom
bulge
in
his
necktie
.
In
another
unseated
party
a
man
endlessly
patted
his
shaven
cheek
with
his
palm
,
and
his
companion
mechanically
raised
and
lowered
the
stub
of
a
cold
cigar
.
The
luckier
ones
fingered
eyeglasses
and
facial
hair
,
the
unequipped
stroked
blank
mouths
,
or
even
pulled
desperately
at
the
lobes
of
their
ears
.
A
well-known
general
came
in
,
and
Abe
,
counting
on
the
man
's
first
year
at
West
Point
--
that
year
during
which
no
cadet
can
resign
and
from
which
none
ever
recovers
--
made
a
bet
with
Dick
of
five
dollars
.
His
hands
hanging
naturally
at
his
sides
,
the
general
waited
to
be
seated
.
Once
his
arms
swung
suddenly
backward
like
a
jumper
's
and
Dick
said
,
``
Ah
!
''
supposing
he
had
lost
control
,
but
the
general
recovered
and
they
breathed
again
--
the
agony
was
nearly
over
,
the
garçon
was
pulling
out
his
chair
.
.
.
With
a
touch
of
fury
the
conqueror
shot
up
his
hand
and
scratched
his
gray
immaculate
head
.
``
You
see
,
''
said
Dick
smugly
,
``
I
'm
the
only
one
.
''
Rosemary
was
quite
sure
of
it
and
Dick
,
realizing
that
he
never
had
a
better
audience
,
made
the
group
into
so
bright
a
unit
that
Rosemary
felt
an
impatient
disregard
for
all
who
were
not
at
their
table
.
They
had
been
two
days
in
Paris
but
actually
they
were
still
under
the
beach
umbrella
.
When
,
as
at
the
ball
of
the
Corps
des
Pages
the
night
before
,
the
surroundings
seemed
formidable
to
Rosemary
,
who
had
yet
to
attend
a
Mayfair
party
in
Hollywood
,
Dick
would
bring
the
scene
within
range
by
greeting
a
few
people
,
a
sort
of
selection
--
the
Divers
seemed
to
have
a
large
acquaintance
,
but
it
was
always
as
if
the
person
had
not
seen
them
for
a
long
,
long
time
,
and
was
utterly
bowled
over
,
``
Why
,
where
do
you
keep
yourselves
?
''
--
and
then
re-create
the
unity
of
his
own
party
by
destroying
the
outsiders
softly
but
permanently
with
an
ironic
coup
de
grâce
.
Presently
Rosemary
seemed
to
have
known
those
people
herself
in
some
deplorable
past
,
and
then
got
on
to
them
,
rejected
them
,
discarded
them
.
Their
own
party
was
overwhelmingly
American
and
sometimes
scarcely
American
at
all
.
It
was
themselves
he
gave
back
to
them
,
blurred
by
the
compromises
of
how
many
years
.
Into
the
dark
,
smoky
restaurant
,
smelling
of
the
rich
raw
foods
on
the
buffet
,
slid
Nicole
's
sky-blue
suit
like
a
stray
segment
of
the
weather
outside
.
Seeing
from
their
eyes
how
beautiful
she
was
,
she
thanked
them
with
a
smile
of
radiant
appreciation
.
They
were
all
very
nice
people
for
a
while
,
very
courteous
and
all
that
.
Then
they
grew
tired
of
it
and
they
were
funny
and
bitter
,
and
finally
they
made
a
lot
of
plans
.
They
laughed
at
things
that
they
would
not
remember
clearly
afterward
--
laughed
a
lot
and
the
men
drank
three
bottles
of
wine
.
The
trio
of
women
at
the
table
were
representative
of
the
enormous
flux
of
American
life
.
Nicole
was
the
granddaughter
of
a
self-made
American
capitalist
and
the
granddaughter
of
a
Count
of
the
House
of
Lippe
Weissenfeld
.
Mary
North
was
the
daughter
of
a
journeyman
paper-hanger
and
a
descendant
of
President
Tyler
.
Rosemary
was
from
the
middle
of
the
middle
class
,
catapulted
by
her
mother
onto
the
uncharted
heights
of
Hollywood
.
Their
point
of
resemblance
to
each
other
and
their
difference
from
so
many
American
women
,
lay
in
the
fact
that
they
were
all
happy
to
exist
in
a
man
's
world
--
they
preserved
their
individuality
through
men
and
not
by
opposition
to
them
.
They
would
all
three
have
made
alternatively
good
courtesans
or
good
wives
not
by
the
accident
of
birth
but
through
the
greater
accident
of
finding
their
man
or
not
finding
him
.
So
Rosemary
found
it
a
pleasant
party
,
that
luncheon
,
nicer
in
that
there
were
only
seven
people
,
about
the
limit
of
a
good
party
.
Perhaps
,
too
,
the
fact
that
she
was
new
to
their
world
acted
as
a
sort
of
catalytic
agent
to
precipitate
out
all
their
old
reservations
about
one
another
.
After
the
table
broke
up
,
a
waiter
directed
Rosemary
back
into
the
dark
hinterland
of
all
French
restaurants
,
where
she
looked
up
a
phone
number
by
a
dim
orange
bulb
,
and
called
Franco-American
Films
.
Sure
,
they
had
a
print
of
``
Daddy
's
Girl
''
--
it
was
out
for
the
moment
,
but
they
would
run
it
off
later
in
the
week
for
her
at
341
Rue
des
Saintes
Anges
--
ask
for
Mr.
Crowder
.
The
semi-booth
gave
on
the
vestiaire
and
as
Rosemary
hung
up
the
receiver
she
heard
two
low
voices
not
five
feet
from
her
on
the
other
side
of
a
row
of
coats.
``
--
So
you
love
me
?
''
``
Oh
,
do
I
!
''
It
Was
Nicole
--
Rosemary
hesitated
in
the
door
of
the
booth
--
then
she
heard
Dick
say
:
``
I
want
you
terribly
--
let
's
go
to
the
hotel
now
.
''
Nicole
gave
a
little
gasping
sigh
.
For
a
moment
the
words
conveyed
nothing
at
all
to
Rosemary
--
but
the
tone
did
.
The
vast
secretiveness
of
it
vibrated
to
herself
.
``
I
want
you
.
''
``
I
'll
be
at
the
hotel
at
four
.
''
Rosemary
stood
breathless
as
the
voices
moved
away
.
She
was
at
first
even
astonished
--
she
had
seen
them
in
their
relation
to
each
other
as
people
without
personal
exigencies
--
as
something
cooler
.
Now
a
strong
current
of
emotion
flowed
through
her
,
profound
and
unidentified
.
She
did
not
know
whether
she
was
attracted
or
repelled
,
but
only
that
she
was
deeply
moved
.
It
made
her
feel
very
alone
as
she
went
back
into
the
restaurant
,
but
it
was
touching
to
look
in
upon
,
and
the
passionate
gratitude
of
Nicole
's
``
Oh
,
do
I
!
''
echoed
in
her
mind
.
The
particular
mood
of
the
passage
she
had
witnessed
lay
ahead
of
her
;
but
however
far
she
was
from
it
her
stomach
told
her
it
was
all
right
--
she
had
none
of
the
aversion
she
had
felt
in
the
playing
of
certain
love
scenes
in
pictures
.
Being
far
away
from
it
she
nevertheless
irrevocably
participated
in
it
now
,
and
shopping
with
Nicole
she
was
much
more
conscious
of
the
assignation
than
Nicole
herself
.
She
looked
at
Nicole
in
a
new
way
,
estimating
her
attractions
.
Certainly
she
was
the
most
attractive
woman
Rosemary
had
ever
met
--
with
her
hardness
,
her
devotions
and
loyalties
,
and
a
certain
elusiveness
,
which
Rosemary
,
thinking
now
through
her
mother
's
middle-class
mind
,
associated
with
her
attitude
about
money
.
Rosemary
spent
money
she
had
earned
--
she
was
here
in
Europe
due
to
the
fact
that
she
had
gone
in
the
pool
six
times
that
January
day
with
her
temperature
roving
from
99°
in
the
early
morning
to
103°
,
when
her
mother
stopped
it
.
With
Nicole
's
help
Rosemary
bought
two
dresses
and
two
hats
and
four
pairs
of
shoes
with
her
money
.
Nicole
bought
from
a
great
list
that
ran
two
pages
,
and
bought
the
things
in
the
windows
besides
.
Everything
she
liked
that
she
could
n't
possibly
use
herself
,
she
bought
as
a
present
for
a
friend
.
She
bought
colored
beads
,
folding
beach
cushions
,
artificial
flowers
,
honey
,
a
guest
bed
,
bags
,
scarfs
,
love
birds
,
miniatures
for
a
doll
's
house
and
three
yards
of
some
new
cloth
the
color
of
prawns
.
She
bought
a
dozen
bathing
suits
,
a
rubber
alligator
,
a
travelling
chess
set
of
gold
and
ivory
,
big
linen
handkerchiefs
for
Abe
,
two
chamois
leather
jackets
of
kingfisher
blue
and
burning
bush
from
Hermes
--
bought
all
these
things
not
a
bit
like
a
high-class
courtesan
buying
underwear
and
jewels
,
which
were
after
all
professional
equipment
and
insurance
--
but
with
an
entirely
different
point
of
view
.
Nicole
was
the
product
of
much
ingenuity
and
toil
.
For
her
sake
trains
began
their
run
at
Chicago
and
traversed
the
round
belly
of
the
continent
to
California
;
chicle
factories
fumed
and
link
belts
grew
link
by
link
in
factories
;
men
mixed
toothpaste
in
vats
and
drew
mouthwash
out
of
copper
hogsheads
;
girls
canned
tomatoes
quickly
in
August
or
worked
rudely
at
the
Five-and-Tens
on
Christmas
Eve
;
half-breed
Indians
toiled
on
Brazilian
coffee
plantations
and
dreamers
were
muscled
out
of
patent
rights
in
new
tractors
--
these
were
some
of
the
people
who
gave
a
tithe
to
Nicole
,
and
as
the
whole
system
swayed
and
thundered
onward
it
lent
a
feverish
bloom
to
such
processes
of
hers
as
wholesale
buying
,
like
the
flush
of
a
fireman
's
face
holding
his
post
before
a
spreading
blaze
.
She
illustrated
very
simple
principles
,
containing
in
herself
her
own
doom
,
but
illustrated
them
so
accurately
that
there
was
grace
in
the
procedure
,
and
presently
Rosemary
would
try
to
imitate
it
.
It
was
almost
four
.
Nicole
stood
in
a
shop
with
a
love
bird
on
her
shoulder
,
and
had
one
of
her
infrequent
outbursts
of
speech
.
``
Well
,
what
if
you
had
n't
gone
in
that
pool
that
day
--
I
sometimes
wonder
about
such
things
.
Just
before
the
war
we
were
in
Berlin
--
I
was
thirteen
,
it
was
just
before
Mother
died
.
My
sister
was
going
to
a
court
ball
and
she
had
three
of
the
royal
princes
on
her
dance
card
,
all
arranged
by
a
chamberlain
and
everything
.
Half
an
hour
before
she
was
going
to
start
she
had
a
side
ache
and
a
high
fever
.
The
doctor
said
it
was
appendicitis
and
she
ought
to
be
operated
on
.
But
Mother
had
her
plans
made
,
so
Baby
went
to
the
ball
and
danced
till
two
with
an
ice
pack
strapped
on
under
her
evening
dress
.
She
was
operated
on
at
seven
o'clock
next
morning
.
''
It
was
good
to
be
hard
,
then
;
all
nice
people
were
hard
on
themselves
.
But
it
was
four
o'clock
and
Rosemary
kept
thinking
of
Dick
waiting
for
Nicole
now
at
the
hotel
.
She
must
go
there
,
she
must
not
make
him
wait
for
her
.
She
kept
thinking
,
``
Why
do
n't
you
go
?
''
and
then
suddenly
,
``
Or
let
me
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
.
''
But
Nicole
went
to
one
more
place
to
buy
corsages
for
them
both
and
sent
one
to
Mary
North
.
Only
then
she
seemed
to
remember
and
with
sudden
abstraction
she
signalled
for
a
taxi
.
``
Good-by
,
''
said
Nicole
.
``
We
had
fun
,
did
n't
we
?
''
``
Loads
of
fun
,
''
said
Rosemary
.
It
was
more
difficult
than
she
thought
and
her
whole
self
protested
as
Nicole
drove
away
.
XIII
Dick
turned
the
corner
of
the
traverse
and
continued
along
the
trench
walking
on
the
duckboard
.
He
came
to
a
periscope
,
looked
through
it
a
moment
;
then
he
got
up
on
the
step
and
peered
over
the
parapet
.
In
front
of
him
beneath
a
dingy
sky
was
Beaumont
Hamel
;
to
his
left
the
tragic
hill
of
Thiepval
.
Dick
stared
at
them
through
his
field
glasses
,
his
throat
straining
with
sadness
.
He
went
on
along
the
trench
,
and
found
the
others
waiting
for
him
in
the
next
traverse
.
He
was
full
of
excitement
and
he
wanted
to
communicate
it
to
them
,
to
make
them
understand
about
this
,
though
actually
Abe
North
had
seen
battle
service
and
he
had
not
.
``
This
land
here
cost
twenty
lives
a
foot
that
summer
,
''
he
said
to
Rosemary
.
She
looked
out
obediently
at
the
rather
bare
green
plain
with
its
low
trees
of
six
years
'
growth
.
If
Dick
had
added
that
they
were
now
being
shelled
she
would
have
believed
him
that
afternoon
.
Her
love
had
reached
a
point
where
now
at
last
she
was
beginning
to
be
unhappy
,
to
be
desperate
.
She
did
n't
know
what
to
do
--
she
wanted
to
talk
to
her
mother
.
``
There
are
lots
of
people
dead
since
and
we
'll
all
be
dead
soon
,
''
said
Abe
consolingly
.
Rosemary
waited
tensely
for
Dick
to
continue
.
``
See
that
little
stream
--
we
could
walk
to
it
in
two
minutes
.
It
took
the
British
a
month
to
walk
to
it
--
a
whole
empire
walking
very
slowly
,
dying
in
front
and
pushing
forward
behind
.
And
another
empire
walked
very
slowly
backward
a
few
inches
a
day
,
leaving
the
dead
like
a
million
bloody
rugs
.
No
Europeans
will
ever
do
that
again
in
this
generation
.
''
``
Why
,
they
've
only
just
quit
over
in
Turkey
,
''
said
Abe
.
``
And
in
Morocco
--
''
``
That
's
different
.
This
western-front
business
could
n't
be
done
again
,
not
for
a
long
time
.
The
young
men
think
they
could
do
it
but
they
could
n't
.
They
could
fight
the
first
Marne
again
but
not
this
.
This
took
religion
and
years
of
plenty
and
tremendous
sureties
and
the
exact
relation
that
existed
between
the
classes
.
The
Russians
and
Italians
were
n't
any
good
on
this
front
.
You
had
to
have
a
whole-souled
sentimental
equipment
going
back
further
than
you
could
remember
.
You
had
to
remember
Christmas
,
and
postcards
of
the
Crown
Prince
and
his
fiancée
,
and
little
cafés
in
Valence
and
beer
gardens
in
Unter
den
Linden
and
weddings
at
the
mairie
,
and
going
to
the
Derby
,
and
your
grandfather
's
whiskers
.
''
``
General
Grant
invented
this
kind
of
battle
at
Petersburg
in
sixty-five
.
''
``
No
,
he
did
n't
--
he
just
invented
mass
butchery
.
This
kind
of
battle
was
invented
by
Lewis
Carroll
and
Jules
Verne
and
whoever
wrote
Undine
,
and
country
deacons
bowling
and
marraines
in
Marseilles
and
girls
seduced
in
the
back
lanes
of
Wurtemburg
and
Westphalia
.
Why
,
this
was
a
love
battle
--
there
was
a
century
of
middle-class
love
spent
here
.
This
was
the
last
love
battle
.
''
``
You
want
to
hand
over
this
battle
to
D.
H.
Lawrence
,
''
said
Abe
.
``
All
my
beautiful
lovely
safe
world
blew
itself
up
here
with
a
great
gust
of
high
explosive
love
,
''
Dick
mourned
persistently
.
``
Is
n't
that
true
,
Rosemary
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
answered
with
a
grave
face
.
``
You
know
everything
.
''
They
dropped
behind
the
others
.
Suddenly
a
shower
of
earth
gobs
and
pebbles
came
down
on
them
and
Abe
yelled
from
the
next
traverse
:
``
The
war
spirit
's
getting
into
me
again
.
I
have
a
hundred
years
of
Ohio
love
behind
me
and
I
'm
going
to
bomb
out
this
trench
.
''
His
head
popped
up
over
the
embankment
.
``
You
're
dead
--
do
n't
you
know
the
rules
?
That
was
a
grenade
.
''
Rosemary
laughed
and
Dick
picked
up
a
retaliatory
handful
of
stones
and
then
put
them
down
.
``
I
could
n't
kid
here
,
''
he
said
rather
apologetically
.
``
The
silver
cord
is
cut
and
the
golden
bowl
is
broken
and
all
that
,
but
an
old
romantic
like
me
ca
n't
do
anything
about
it
.
''
``
I
'm
romantic
too
.
''
They
came
out
of
the
neat
restored
trench
,
and
faced
a
memorial
to
the
Newfoundland
dead
.
Reading
the
inscription
Rosemary
burst
into
sudden
tears
.
Like
most
women
she
liked
to
be
told
how
she
should
feel
,
and
she
liked
Dick
's
telling
her
which
things
were
ludicrous
and
which
things
were
sad
.
But
most
of
all
she
wanted
him
to
know
how
she
loved
him
,
now
that
the
fact
was
upsetting
everything
,
now
that
she
was
walking
over
the
battlefield
in
a
thrilling
dream
.
After
that
they
got
in
their
car
and
started
back
toward
Amiens
.
A
thin
warm
rain
was
falling
on
the
new
scrubby
woods
and
underbrush
and
they
passed
great
funeral
pyres
of
sorted
duds
,
shells
,
bombs
,
grenades
,
and
equipment
,
helmets
,
bayonets
,
gun
stocks
and
rotten
leather
,
abandoned
six
years
in
the
ground
.
And
suddenly
around
a
bend
the
white
caps
of
a
great
sea
of
graves
.
Dick
asked
the
chauffeur
to
stop
.
``
There
's
that
girl
--
and
she
still
has
her
wreath
.
''
They
watched
as
he
got
out
and
went
over
to
the
girl
,
who
stood
uncertainly
by
the
gate
with
a
wreath
in
her
hand
.
Her
taxi
waited
.
She
was
a
red-haired
girl
from
Tennessee
whom
they
had
met
on
the
train
this
morning
,
come
from
Knoxville
to
lay
a
memorial
on
her
brother
's
grave
.
There
were
tears
of
vexation
on
her
face
.
``
The
War
Department
must
have
given
me
the
wrong
number
,
''
she
whimpered
.
``
It
had
another
name
on
it
.
I
been
lookin
'
for
it
since
two
o'clock
,
and
there
's
so
many
graves
.
''
``
Then
if
I
were
you
I
'd
just
lay
it
on
any
grave
without
looking
at
the
name
,
''
Dick
advised
her
.
``
You
reckon
that
's
what
I
ought
to
do
?
''
``
I
think
that
's
what
he
'd
have
wanted
you
to
do
.
''
It
was
growing
dark
and
the
rain
was
coming
down
harder
.
She
left
the
wreath
on
the
first
grave
inside
the
gate
,
and
accepted
Dick
's
suggestion
that
she
dismiss
her
taxi-cab
and
ride
back
to
Amiens
with
them
.
Rosemary
shed
tears
again
when
she
heard
of
the
mishap
--
altogether
it
had
been
a
watery
day
,
but
she
felt
that
she
had
learned
something
,
though
exactly
what
it
was
she
did
not
know
.
Later
she
remembered
all
the
hours
of
the
afternoon
as
happy
--
one
of
those
uneventful
times
that
seem
at
the
moment
only
a
link
between
past
and
future
pleasure
but
turn
out
to
have
been
the
pleasure
itself
.
Amiens
was
an
echoing
purple
town
,
still
sad
with
the
war
,
as
some
railroad
stations
were
:
--
the
Gare
du
Nord
and
Waterloo
station
in
London
.
In
the
daytime
one
is
deflated
by
such
towns
,
with
their
little
trolley
cars
of
twenty
years
ago
crossing
the
great
gray
cobble-stoned
squares
in
front
of
the
cathedral
,
and
the
very
weather
seems
to
have
a
quality
of
the
past
,
faded
weather
like
that
of
old
photographs
.
But
after
dark
all
that
is
most
satisfactory
in
French
life
swims
back
into
the
picture
--
the
sprightly
tarts
,
the
men
arguing
with
a
hundred
Voilàs
in
the
cafés
,
the
couples
drifting
,
head
to
head
,
toward
the
satisfactory
inexpensiveness
of
nowhere
.
Waiting
for
the
train
they
sat
in
a
big
arcade
,
tall
enough
to
release
the
smoke
and
chatter
and
music
upward
and
obligingly
the
orchestra
launched
into
``
Yes
,
We
Have
No
Bananas
,
''
--
they
clapped
,
because
the
leader
looked
so
pleased
with
himself
.
The
Tennessee
girl
forgot
her
sorrow
and
enjoyed
herself
,
even
began
flirtations
of
tropical
eye-rollings
and
pawings
,
with
Dick
and
Abe
.
They
teased
her
gently
.
Then
,
leaving
infinitesimal
sections
of
Wurtemburgers
,
Prussian
Guards
,
Chasseurs
Alpins
,
Manchester
mill
hands
and
old
Etonians
to
pursue
their
eternal
dissolution
under
the
warm
rain
,
they
took
the
train
for
Paris
.
They
ate
sandwiches
of
mortadel
sausage
and
bel
paese
cheese
made
up
in
the
station
restaurant
,
and
drank
Beaujolais
.
Nicole
was
abstracted
,
biting
her
lip
restlessly
and
reading
over
the
guide-books
to
the
battle-field
that
Dick
had
brought
along
--
indeed
,
he
had
made
a
quick
study
of
the
whole
affair
,
simplifying
it
always
until
it
bore
a
faint
resemblance
to
one
of
his
own
parties
.
XIV
When
they
reached
Paris
Nicole
was
too
tired
to
go
on
to
the
grand
illumination
at
the
Decorative
Art
Exposition
as
they
had
planned
.
They
left
her
at
the
Hotel
Roi
George
,
and
as
she
disappeared
between
the
intersecting
planes
made
by
lobby
lights
of
the
glass
doors
,
Rosemary
's
oppression
lifted
.
Nicole
was
a
force
--
not
necessarily
well
disposed
or
predictable
like
her
mother
--
an
incalculable
force
.
Rosemary
was
somewhat
afraid
of
her
.
At
eleven
she
sat
with
Dick
and
the
Norths
at
a
houseboat
café
just
opened
on
the
Seine
.
The
river
shimmered
with
lights
from
the
bridges
and
cradled
many
cold
moons
.
On
Sundays
sometimes
when
Rosemary
and
her
mother
had
lived
in
Paris
they
had
taken
the
little
steamer
up
to
Suresnes
and
talked
about
plans
for
the
future
.
They
had
little
money
but
Mrs.
Speers
was
so
sure
of
Rosemary
's
beauty
and
had
implanted
in
her
so
much
ambition
,
that
she
was
willing
to
gamble
the
money
on
``
advantages
''
;
Rosemary
in
turn
was
to
repay
her
mother
when
she
got
her
start
.
.
.
.
Since
reaching
Paris
Abe
North
had
had
a
thin
vinous
fur
over
him
;
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
from
sun
and
wine
.
Rosemary
realized
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
always
stopping
in
places
to
get
a
drink
,
and
she
wondered
how
Mary
North
liked
it
.
Mary
was
quiet
,
so
quiet
save
for
her
frequent
laughter
that
Rosemary
had
learned
little
about
her
.
She
liked
the
straight
dark
hair
brushed
back
until
it
met
some
sort
of
natural
cascade
that
took
care
of
it
--
from
time
to
time
it
eased
with
a
jaunty
slant
over
the
corner
of
her
temple
,
until
it
was
almost
in
her
eye
when
she
tossed
her
head
and
caused
it
to
fall
sleek
into
place
once
more
.
``
We
'll
turn
in
early
to-night
,
Abe
,
after
this
drink
.
''
Mary
's
voice
was
light
but
it
held
a
little
flicker
of
anxiety
.
``
You
do
n't
want
to
be
poured
on
the
boat
.
''
``
It
's
pretty
late
now
,
''
Dick
said
.
``
We
'd
all
better
go
.
''
The
noble
dignity
of
Abe
's
face
took
on
a
certain
stubbornness
,
and
he
remarked
with
determination
:
``
Oh
,
no
.
''
He
paused
gravely
.
``
Oh
,
no
,
not
yet
.
We
'll
have
another
bottle
of
champagne
.
''
``
No
more
for
me
,
''
said
Dick
.
``
It
's
Rosemary
I
'm
thinking
of
.
She
's
a
natural
alcoholic
--
keeps
a
bottle
of
gin
in
the
bathroom
and
all
that
--
her
mother
told
me
.
''
He
emptied
what
was
left
of
the
first
bottle
into
Rosemary
's
glass
.
She
had
made
herself
quite
sick
the
first
day
in
Paris
with
quarts
of
lemonade
;
after
that
she
had
taken
nothing
with
them
but
now
she
raised
the
champagne
and
drank
at
it
.
``
But
what
's
this
?
''
exclaimed
Dick
.
``
You
told
me
you
did
n't
drink
.
''
``
I
did
n't
say
I
was
never
going
to
.
''
``
What
about
your
mother
?
''
``
I
'm
just
going
to
drink
this
one
glass
.
''
She
felt
some
necessity
for
it
.
Dick
drank
,
not
too
much
,
but
he
drank
,
and
perhaps
it
would
bring
her
closer
to
him
,
be
a
part
of
the
equipment
for
what
she
had
to
do
.
She
drank
it
quickly
,
choked
and
then
said
,
``
Besides
,
yesterday
was
my
birthday
--
I
was
eighteen
.
''
``
Why
did
n't
you
tell
us
?
''
they
said
indignantly
.
``
I
knew
you
'd
make
a
fuss
over
it
and
go
to
a
lot
of
trouble
.
''
She
finished
the
champagne
.
``
So
this
is
the
celebration
.
''
``
It
most
certainly
is
not
,
''
Dick
assured
her
.
``
The
dinner
tomorrow
night
is
your
birthday
party
and
do
n't
forget
it
.
Eighteen
--
why
that
's
a
terribly
important
age
.
''
``
I
used
to
think
until
you
're
eighteen
nothing
matters
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
That
's
right
,
''
Abe
agreed
.
``
And
afterward
it
's
the
same
way
.
''
``
Abe
feels
that
nothing
matters
till
he
gets
on
the
boat
,
''
said
Mary
.
``
This
time
he
really
has
got
everything
planned
out
when
he
gets
to
New
York
.
''
She
spoke
as
though
she
were
tired
of
saying
things
that
no
longer
had
a
meaning
for
her
,
as
if
in
reality
the
course
that
she
and
her
husband
followed
,
or
failed
to
follow
,
had
become
merely
an
intention
.
``
He
'll
be
writing
music
in
America
and
I
'll
be
working
at
singing
in
Munich
,
so
when
we
get
together
again
there
'll
be
nothing
we
ca
n't
do
.
''
``
That
's
wonderful
,
''
agreed
Rosemary
,
feeling
the
champagne
.
``
Meanwhile
,
another
touch
of
champagne
for
Rosemary
.
Then
she
'll
be
more
able
to
rationalize
the
acts
of
her
lymphatic
glands
.
They
only
begin
to
function
at
eighteen
.
''
Dick
laughed
indulgently
at
Abe
,
whom
he
loved
,
and
in
whom
he
had
long
lost
hope
:
``
That
's
medically
incorrect
and
we
're
going
.
''
Catching
the
faint
patronage
Abe
said
lightly
:
``
Something
tells
me
I
'll
have
a
new
score
on
Broadway
long
before
you
've
finished
your
scientific
treatise
.
''
``
I
hope
so
,
''
said
Dick
evenly
.
``
I
hope
so
.
I
may
even
abandon
what
you
call
my
'scientific
treatise
.
'
''
``
Oh
,
Dick
!
''
Mary
's
voice
was
startled
,
was
shocked
.
Rosemary
had
never
before
seen
Dick
's
face
utterly
expressionless
;
she
felt
that
this
announcement
was
something
momentous
and
she
was
inclined
to
exclaim
with
Mary
``
Oh
,
Dick
!
''
But
suddenly
Dick
laughed
again
,
added
to
his
remark
``
--
abandon
it
for
another
one
,
''
and
got
up
from
the
table
.
``
But
Dick
,
sit
down
.
I
want
to
know
--
''
``
I
'll
tell
you
some
time
.
Good
night
,
Abe
.
Good
night
,
Mary
.
''
``
Good
night
,
dear
Dick
.
''
Mary
smiled
as
if
she
were
going
to
be
perfectly
happy
sitting
there
on
the
almost
deserted
boat
.
She
was
a
brave
,
hopeful
woman
and
she
was
following
her
husband
somewhere
,
changing
herself
to
this
kind
of
person
or
that
,
without
being
able
to
lead
him
a
step
out
of
his
path
,
and
sometimes
realizing
with
discouragement
how
deep
in
him
the
guarded
secret
of
her
direction
lay
.
And
yet
an
air
of
luck
clung
about
her
,
as
if
she
were
a
sort
of
token
.
.
.
.
XV
``
What
is
it
you
are
giving
up
?
''
demanded
Rosemary
,
facing
Dick
earnestly
in
the
taxi
.
``
Nothing
of
importance
.
''
``
Are
you
a
scientist
?
''
``
I
'm
a
doctor
of
medicine
.
''
``
Oh-h
!
''
she
smiled
delightedly
.
``
My
father
was
a
doctor
too
.
Then
why
do
n't
you
--
''
she
stopped
.
``
There
's
no
mystery
.
I
did
n't
disgrace
myself
at
the
height
of
my
career
,
and
hide
away
on
the
Riviera
.
I
'm
just
not
practising
.
You
ca
n't
tell
,
I
'll
probably
practise
again
some
day
.
''
Rosemary
put
up
her
face
quietly
to
be
kissed
.
He
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
as
if
he
did
n't
understand
.
Then
holding
her
in
the
hollow
of
his
arm
he
rubbed
his
cheek
against
her
cheek
's
softness
,
and
then
looked
down
at
her
for
another
long
moment
.
``
Such
a
lovely
child
,
''
he
said
gravely
.
She
smiled
up
at
him
;
her
hands
playing
conventionally
with
the
lapels
of
his
coat
.
``
I
'm
in
love
with
you
and
Nicole
.
Actually
that
's
my
secret
--
I
ca
n't
even
talk
about
you
to
anybody
because
I
do
n't
want
any
more
people
to
know
how
wonderful
you
are
.
Honestly
--
I
love
you
and
Nicole
--
I
do
.
''
--
So
many
times
he
had
heard
this
--
even
the
formula
was
the
same
.
Suddenly
she
came
toward
him
,
her
youth
vanishing
as
she
passed
inside
the
focus
of
his
eyes
and
he
had
kissed
her
breathlessly
as
if
she
were
any
age
at
all
.
Then
she
lay
back
against
his
arm
and
sighed
.
``
I
've
decided
to
give
you
up
,
''
she
said
.
Dick
started
--
had
he
said
anything
to
imply
that
she
possessed
any
part
of
him
?
``
But
that
's
very
mean
,
''
he
managed
to
say
lightly
,
``
just
when
I
was
getting
interested
.
''
``
I
've
loved
you
so
--
''
As
if
it
had
been
for
years
.
She
was
weeping
a
little
now
.
``
I
've
loved
you
so-o-o
.
''
Then
he
should
have
laughed
,
but
he
heard
himself
saying
,
``
Not
only
are
you
beautiful
but
you
are
somehow
on
the
grand
scale
.
Everything
you
do
,
like
pretending
to
be
in
love
or
pretending
to
be
shy
gets
across
.
''
In
the
dark
cave
of
the
taxi
,
fragrant
with
the
perfume
Rosemary
had
bought
with
Nicole
,
she
came
close
again
,
clinging
to
him
.
He
kissed
her
without
enjoying
it
.
He
knew
that
there
was
passion
there
,
but
there
was
no
shadow
of
it
in
her
eyes
or
on
her
mouth
;
there
was
a
faint
spray
of
champagne
on
her
breath
.
She
clung
nearer
desperately
and
once
more
he
kissed
her
and
was
chilled
by
the
innocence
of
her
kiss
,
by
the
glance
that
at
the
moment
of
contact
looked
beyond
him
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
,
the
darkness
of
the
world
.
She
did
not
know
yet
that
splendor
is
something
in
the
heart
;
at
the
moment
when
she
realized
that
and
melted
into
the
passion
of
the
universe
he
could
take
her
without
question
or
regret
.
Her
room
in
the
hotel
was
diagonally
across
from
theirs
and
nearer
the
elevator
.
When
they
reached
the
door
she
said
suddenly
:
``
I
know
you
do
n't
love
me
--
I
do
n't
expect
it
.
But
you
said
I
should
have
told
you
about
my
birthday
.
Well
,
I
did
,
and
now
for
my
birthday
present
I
want
you
to
come
into
my
room
a
minute
while
I
tell
you
something
.
Just
one
minute
.
''
They
went
in
and
he
closed
the
door
,
and
Rosemary
stood
close
to
him
,
not
touching
him
.
The
night
had
drawn
the
color
from
her
face
--
she
was
pale
as
pale
now
,
she
was
a
white
carnation
left
after
a
dance
.
``
When
you
smile
--
''
He
had
recovered
his
paternal
attitude
,
perhaps
because
of
Nicole
's
silent
proximity
,
``
I
always
think
I
'll
see
a
gap
where
you
've
lost
some
baby
teeth
.
''
But
he
was
too
late
--
she
came
close
up
against
him
with
a
forlorn
whisper
.
``
Take
me
.
''
``
Take
you
where
?
''
Astonishment
froze
him
rigid
.
``
Go
on
,
''
she
whispered
.
``
Oh
,
please
go
on
,
whatever
they
do
.
I
do
n't
care
if
I
do
n't
like
it
--
I
never
expected
to
--
I
've
always
hated
to
think
about
it
but
now
I
do
n't
.
I
want
you
to
.
''
She
was
astonished
at
herself
--
she
had
never
imagined
she
could
talk
like
that
.
She
was
calling
on
things
she
had
read
,
seen
,
dreamed
through
a
decade
of
convent
hours
.
Suddenly
she
knew
too
that
it
was
one
of
her
greatest
rôles
and
she
flung
herself
into
it
more
passionately
.
``
This
is
not
as
it
should
be
,
''
Dick
deliberated
.
``
Is
n't
it
just
the
champagne
?
Let
's
more
or
less
forget
it
.
''
``
Oh
,
no
,
now
.
I
want
you
to
do
it
now
,
take
me
,
show
me
,
I
'm
absolutely
yours
and
I
want
to
be
.
''
``
For
one
thing
,
have
you
thought
how
much
it
would
hurt
Nicole
?
''
``
She
wo
n't
know
--
this
wo
n't
have
anything
to
do
with
her
.
''
He
continued
kindly
.
``
Then
there
's
the
fact
that
I
love
Nicole
.
''
``
But
you
can
love
more
than
just
one
person
,
ca
n't
you
?
Like
I
love
Mother
and
I
love
you
--
more
.
I
love
you
more
now
.
''
``
--
the
fourth
place
you
're
not
in
love
with
me
but
you
might
be
afterwards
,
and
that
would
begin
your
life
with
a
terrible
mess
.
''
``
No
,
I
promise
I
'll
never
see
you
again
.
I
'll
get
Mother
and
go
to
America
right
away
.
''
He
dismissed
this
.
He
was
remembering
too
vividly
the
youth
and
freshness
of
her
lips
.
He
took
another
tone
.
``
You
're
just
in
that
mood
.
''
``
Oh
,
please
,
I
do
n't
care
even
if
I
had
a
baby
.
I
could
go
into
Mexico
like
a
girl
at
the
studio
.
Oh
,
this
is
so
different
from
anything
I
ever
thought
--
I
used
to
hate
it
when
they
kissed
me
seriously
.
''
He
saw
she
was
still
under
the
impression
that
it
must
happen
.
``
Some
of
them
had
great
big
teeth
,
but
you
're
all
different
and
beautiful
.
I
want
you
to
do
it
.
''
``
I
believe
you
think
people
just
kiss
some
way
and
you
want
me
to
kiss
you
.
''
``
Oh
,
do
n't
tease
me
--
I
'm
not
a
baby
.
I
know
you
're
not
in
love
with
me
.
''
She
was
suddenly
humble
and
quiet
.
``
I
did
n't
expect
that
much
.
I
know
I
must
seem
just
nothing
to
you
.
''
``
Nonsense
.
But
you
seem
young
to
me
.
''
His
thoughts
added
,
``
--
there
'd
be
so
much
to
teach
you
.
''
Rosemary
waited
,
breathing
eagerly
till
Dick
said
:
``
And
lastly
things
are
n't
arranged
so
that
this
could
be
as
you
want
.
''
Her
face
drooped
with
dismay
and
disappointment
and
Dick
said
automatically
,
``
We
'll
have
to
simply
--
''
He
stopped
himself
,
followed
her
to
the
bed
,
sat
down
beside
her
while
she
wept
.
He
was
suddenly
confused
,
not
about
the
ethics
of
the
matter
,
for
the
impossibility
of
it
was
sheerly
indicated
from
all
angles
but
simply
confused
,
and
for
a
moment
his
usual
grace
,
the
tensile
strength
of
his
balance
,
was
absent
.
``
I
knew
you
would
n't
,
''
she
sobbed
.
``
It
was
just
a
forlorn
hope
.
''
He
stood
up
.
``
Good
night
,
child
.
This
is
a
damn
shame
.
Let
's
drop
it
out
of
the
picture
.
''
He
gave
her
two
lines
of
hospital
patter
to
go
to
sleep
on
.
``
So
many
people
are
going
to
love
you
and
it
might
be
nice
to
meet
your
first
love
all
intact
,
emotionally
too
.
That
's
an
old-fashioned
idea
,
is
n't
it
?
''
She
looked
up
at
him
as
he
took
a
step
toward
the
door
;
she
looked
at
him
without
the
slightest
idea
as
to
what
was
in
his
head
,
she
saw
him
take
another
step
in
slow
motion
,
turn
and
look
at
her
again
,
and
she
wanted
for
a
moment
to
hold
him
and
devour
him
,
wanted
his
mouth
,
his
ears
,
his
coat
collar
,
wanted
to
surround
him
and
engulf
him
;
she
saw
his
hand
fall
on
the
doorknob
.
Then
she
gave
up
and
sank
back
on
the
bed
.
When
the
door
closed
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
mirror
,
where
she
began
brushing
her
hair
,
sniffling
a
little
.
One
hundred
and
fifty
strokes
Rosemary
gave
it
,
as
usual
,
then
a
hundred
and
fifty
more
.
She
brushed
it
until
her
arm
ached
,
then
she
changed
arms
and
went
on
brushing
.
.
.
.
XVI
She
woke
up
cooled
and
shamed
.
The
sight
of
her
beauty
in
the
mirror
did
not
reassure
her
but
only
awakened
the
ache
of
yesterday
and
a
letter
,
forwarded
by
her
mother
,
from
the
boy
who
had
taken
her
to
the
Yale
prom
last
fall
,
which
announced
his
presence
in
Paris
was
no
help
--
all
that
seemed
far
away
.
She
emerged
from
her
room
for
the
ordeal
of
meeting
the
Divers
weighted
with
a
double
trouble
.
But
it
was
hidden
by
a
sheath
as
impermeable
as
Nicole
's
when
they
met
and
went
together
to
a
series
of
fittings
.
It
was
consoling
,
though
,
when
Nicole
remarked
,
apropos
of
a
distraught
saleswoman
:
``
Most
people
think
everybody
feels
about
them
much
more
violently
than
they
actually
do
--
they
think
other
people
's
opinions
of
them
swing
through
great
arcs
of
approval
or
disapproval
.
''
Yesterday
in
her
expansiveness
Rosemary
would
have
resented
that
remark
--
to-day
in
her
desire
to
minimize
what
had
happened
she
welcomed
it
eagerly
.
She
admired
Nicole
for
her
beauty
and
her
wisdom
,
and
also
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
jealous
.
Just
before
leaving
Gausse
's
hotel
her
mother
had
said
in
that
casual
tone
,
which
Rosemary
knew
concealed
her
most
significant
opinions
,
that
Nicole
was
a
great
beauty
,
with
the
frank
implication
that
Rosemary
was
not
.
This
did
not
bother
Rosemary
,
who
had
only
recently
been
allowed
to
learn
that
she
was
even
personable
;
so
that
her
prettiness
never
seemed
exactly
her
own
but
rather
an
acquirement
,
like
her
French
.
Nevertheless
,
in
the
taxi
she
looked
at
Nicole
,
matching
herself
against
her
.
There
were
all
the
potentialities
for
romantic
love
in
that
lovely
body
and
in
the
delicate
mouth
,
sometimes
tight
,
sometimes
expectantly
half
open
to
the
world
.
Nicole
had
been
a
beauty
as
a
young
girl
and
she
would
be
a
beauty
later
when
her
skin
stretched
tight
over
her
high
cheekbones
--
the
essential
structure
was
there
.
She
had
been
white-Saxon-blonde
but
she
was
more
beautiful
now
that
her
hair
had
darkened
than
when
it
had
been
like
a
cloud
and
more
beautiful
than
she
.
``
We
lived
there
,
''
Rosemary
suddenly
pointed
to
a
building
in
the
Rue
des
Saints-Péres
.
``
That
's
strange
.
Because
when
I
was
twelve
Mother
and
Baby
and
I
once
spent
a
winter
there
,
''
and
she
pointed
to
a
hotel
directly
across
the
street
.
The
two
dingy
fronts
stared
at
them
,
gray
echoes
of
girlhood
.
``
We
'd
just
built
our
Lake
Forest
house
and
we
were
economizing
,
''
Nicole
continued
.
``
At
least
Baby
and
I
and
the
governess
economized
and
Mother
travelled
.
''
``
We
were
economizing
too
,
''
said
Rosemary
,
realizing
that
the
word
meant
different
things
to
them
.
``
Mother
always
spoke
of
it
very
carefully
as
a
small
hotel
--
''
Nicole
gave
her
quick
magnetic
little
laugh
,
``
--
I
mean
instead
of
saying
a
'cheap
'
hotel
.
If
any
swanky
friends
asked
us
our
address
we
'd
never
say
,
'We
're
in
a
dingy
little
hole
over
in
the
apache
quarter
where
we
're
glad
of
running
water
,
'
--
we
'd
say
'We
're
in
a
small
hotel
.
'
As
if
all
the
big
ones
were
too
noisy
and
vulgar
for
us
.
Of
course
the
friends
always
saw
through
us
and
told
everyone
about
it
,
but
Mother
always
said
it
showed
we
knew
our
way
around
Europe
.
She
did
,
of
course
:
she
was
born
a
German
citizen
.
But
her
mother
was
American
,
and
she
was
brought
up
in
Chicago
,
and
she
was
more
American
than
European
.
''
They
were
meeting
the
others
in
two
minutes
,
and
Rosemary
reconstructed
herself
once
more
as
they
got
out
of
the
taxi
in
the
Rue
Guynemer
,
across
from
the
Luxembourg
Gardens
.
They
were
lunching
in
the
Norths
'
already
dismantled
apartment
high
above
the
green
mass
of
leaves
.
The
day
seemed
different
to
Rosemary
from
the
day
before
--
When
she
saw
him
face
to
face
their
eyes
met
and
brushed
like
birds
'
wings
.
After
that
everything
was
all
right
,
everything
was
wonderful
,
she
knew
that
he
was
beginning
to
fall
in
love
with
her
.
She
felt
wildly
happy
,
felt
the
warm
sap
of
emotion
being
pumped
through
her
body
.
A
cool
,
clear
confidence
deepened
and
sang
in
her
.
She
scarcely
looked
at
Dick
but
she
knew
everything
was
all
right
.
After
luncheon
the
Divers
and
the
Norths
and
Rosemary
went
to
the
Franco-American
Films
,
to
be
joined
by
Collis
Clay
,
her
young
man
from
New
Haven
,
to
whom
she
had
telephoned
.
He
was
a
Georgian
,
with
the
peculiarly
regular
,
even
stencilled
ideas
of
Southerners
who
are
educated
in
the
North
.
Last
winter
she
had
thought
him
attractive
--
once
they
held
hands
in
an
automobile
going
from
New
Haven
to
New
York
;
now
he
no
longer
existed
for
her
.
In
the
projection
room
she
sat
between
Collis
Clay
and
Dick
while
the
mechanic
mounted
the
reels
of
Daddy
's
Girl
and
a
French
executive
fluttered
about
her
trying
to
talk
American
slang
.
``
Yes
,
boy
,
''
he
said
when
there
was
trouble
with
the
projector
,
``
I
have
not
any
benenas
.
''
Then
the
lights
went
out
,
there
was
the
sudden
click
and
a
flickering
noise
and
she
was
alone
with
Dick
at
last
.
They
looked
at
each
other
in
the
half
darkness
.
``
Dear
Rosemary
,
''
he
murmured
.
Their
shoulders
touched
.
Nicole
stirred
restlessly
at
the
end
of
the
row
and
Abe
coughed
convulsively
and
blew
his
nose
;
then
they
all
settled
down
and
the
picture
ran
.
There
she
was
--
the
school
girl
of
a
year
ago
,
hair
down
her
back
and
rippling
out
stiffly
like
the
solid
hair
of
a
tanagra
figure
;
there
she
was
--
so
young
and
innocent
--
the
product
of
her
mother
's
loving
care
;
there
she
was
--
embodying
all
the
immaturity
of
the
race
,
cutting
a
new
cardboard
paper
doll
to
pass
before
its
empty
harlot
's
mind
.
She
remembered
how
she
had
felt
in
that
dress
,
especially
fresh
and
new
under
the
fresh
young
silk
.
Daddy
's
girl
.
Was
it
a
'itty-bitty
bravekins
and
did
it
suffer
?
Ooo-ooo-tweet
,
de
tweetest
thing
,
was
n't
she
dest
too
tweet
?
Before
her
tiny
fist
the
forces
of
lust
and
corruption
rolled
away
;
nay
,
the
very
march
of
destiny
stopped
;
inevitable
became
evitable
,
syllogism
,
dialectic
,
all
rationality
fell
away
.
Women
would
forget
the
dirty
dishes
at
home
and
weep
,
even
within
the
picture
one
woman
wept
so
long
that
she
almost
stole
the
film
away
from
Rosemary
.
She
wept
all
over
a
set
that
cost
a
fortune
,
in
a
Duncan
Phyfe
dining-room
,
in
an
aviation
port
,
and
during
a
yacht-race
that
was
only
used
in
two
flashes
,
in
a
subway
and
finally
in
a
bathroom
.
But
Rosemary
triumphed
.
Her
fineness
of
character
,
her
courage
and
steadfastness
intruded
upon
by
the
vulgarity
of
the
world
,
and
Rosemary
showing
what
it
took
with
a
face
that
had
not
yet
become
mask-like
--
yet
it
was
actually
so
moving
that
the
emotions
of
the
whole
row
of
people
went
out
to
her
at
intervals
during
the
picture
.
There
was
a
break
once
and
the
light
went
on
and
after
the
chatter
of
applause
Dick
said
to
her
sincerely
:
``
I
'm
simply
astounded
.
You
're
going
to
be
one
of
the
best
actresses
on
the
stage
.
''
Then
back
to
Daddy
's
Girl
:
happier
days
now
,
and
a
lovely
shot
of
Rosemary
and
her
parent
united
at
the
last
in
a
father
complex
so
apparent
that
Dick
winced
for
all
psychologists
at
the
vicious
sentimentality
.
The
screen
vanished
,
the
lights
went
on
,
the
moment
had
come
.
``
I
've
arranged
one
other
thing
,
''
announced
Rosemary
to
the
company
at
large
,
``
I
've
arranged
a
test
for
Dick
.
''
``
A
what
?
''
``
A
screen
test
,
they
'll
take
one
now
.
''
There
was
an
awful
silence
--
then
an
irrepressible
chortle
from
the
Norths
.
Rosemary
watched
Dick
comprehend
what
she
meant
,
his
face
moving
first
in
an
Irish
way
;
simultaneously
she
realized
that
she
had
made
some
mistake
in
the
playing
of
her
trump
and
still
she
did
not
suspect
that
the
card
was
at
fault
.
``
I
do
n't
want
a
test
,
''
said
Dick
firmly
;
then
,
seeing
the
situation
as
a
whole
,
he
continued
lightly
,
``
Rosemary
,
I
'm
disappointed
.
The
pictures
make
a
fine
career
for
a
woman
--
but
my
God
,
they
ca
n't
photograph
me
.
I
'm
an
old
scientist
all
wrapped
up
in
his
private
life
.
''
Nicole
and
Mary
urged
him
ironically
to
seize
the
opportunity
;
they
teased
him
,
both
faintly
annoyed
at
not
having
been
asked
for
a
sitting
.
But
Dick
closed
the
subject
with
a
somewhat
tart
discussion
of
actors
:
``
The
strongest
guard
is
placed
at
the
gateway
to
nothing
,
''
he
said
.
``
Maybe
because
the
condition
of
emptiness
is
too
shameful
to
be
divulged
.
''
In
the
taxi
with
Dick
and
Collis
Clay
--
they
were
dropping
Collis
,
and
Dick
was
taking
Rosemary
to
a
tea
from
which
Nicole
and
the
Norths
had
resigned
in
order
to
do
the
things
Abe
had
left
undone
till
the
last
--
in
the
taxi
Rosemary
reproached
him
.
``
I
thought
if
the
test
turned
out
to
be
good
I
could
take
it
to
California
with
me
.
And
then
maybe
if
they
liked
it
you
'd
come
out
and
be
my
leading
man
in
a
picture
.
''
He
was
overwhelmed
.
``
It
was
a
darn
sweet
thought
,
but
I
'd
rather
look
at
you
.
You
were
about
the
nicest
sight
I
ever
looked
at
.
''
``
That
's
a
great
picture
,
''
said
Collis
.
``
I
've
seen
it
four
times
.
I
know
one
boy
at
New
Haven
who
's
seen
it
a
dozen
times
--
he
went
all
the
way
to
Hartford
to
see
it
one
time
.
And
when
I
brought
Rosemary
up
to
New
Haven
he
was
so
shy
he
would
n't
meet
her
.
Can
you
beat
that
?
This
little
girl
knocks
them
cold
.
''
Dick
and
Rosemary
looked
at
each
other
,
wanting
to
be
alone
,
but
Collis
failed
to
understand
.
``
I
'll
drop
you
where
you
're
going
,
''
he
suggested
.
``
I
'm
staying
at
the
Lutetia
.
''
``
We
'll
drop
you
,
''
said
Dick
.
``
It
'll
be
easier
for
me
to
drop
you
.
No
trouble
at
all
.
''
``
I
think
it
will
be
better
if
we
drop
you
.
''
``
But
--
''
began
Collis
;
he
grasped
the
situation
at
last
and
began
discussing
with
Rosemary
when
he
would
see
her
again
.
Finally
,
he
was
gone
,
with
the
shadowy
unimportance
but
the
offensive
bulk
of
the
third
party
.
The
car
stopped
unexpectedly
,
unsatisfactorily
,
at
the
address
Dick
had
given
.
He
drew
a
long
breath
.
``
Shall
we
go
in
?
''
``
I
do
n't
care
,
''
Rosemary
said
.
``
I
'll
do
anything
you
want
.
''
He
considered
.
``
I
almost
have
to
go
in
--
she
wants
to
buy
some
pictures
from
a
friend
of
mine
who
needs
the
money
.
''
Rosemary
smoothed
the
brief
expressive
disarray
of
her
hair
.
``
We
'll
stay
just
five
minutes
,
''
he
decided
.
``
You
're
not
going
to
like
these
people
.
''
She
assumed
that
they
were
dull
and
stereotyped
people
,
or
gross
and
drunken
people
,
or
tiresome
,
insistent
people
,
or
any
of
the
sorts
of
people
that
the
Divers
avoided
.
She
was
entirely
unprepared
for
the
impression
that
the
scene
made
on
her
.
XVII
It
was
a
house
hewn
from
the
frame
of
Cardinal
de
Retz
's
palace
in
the
Rue
Monsieur
,
but
once
inside
the
door
there
was
nothing
of
the
past
,
nor
of
any
present
that
Rosemary
knew
.
The
outer
shell
,
the
masonry
,
seemed
rather
to
enclose
the
future
so
that
it
was
an
electric-like
shock
,
a
definite
nervous
experience
,
perverted
as
a
breakfast
of
oatmeal
and
hashish
,
to
cross
that
threshold
,
if
it
could
be
so
called
,
into
the
long
hall
of
blue
steel
,
silver-gilt
,
and
the
myriad
facets
of
many
oddly
bevelled
mirrors
.
The
effect
was
unlike
that
of
any
part
of
the
Decorative
Arts
Exhibition
--
for
there
were
people
in
it
,
not
in
front
of
it
.
Rosemary
had
the
detached
false-and-exalted
feeling
of
being
on
a
set
and
she
guessed
that
every
one
else
present
had
that
feeling
too
.
There
were
about
thirty
people
,
mostly
women
,
and
all
fashioned
by
Louisa
M.
Alcott
or
Madame
de
Ségur
;
and
they
functioned
on
this
set
as
cautiously
,
as
precisely
,
as
does
a
human
hand
picking
up
jagged
broken
glass
.
Neither
individually
nor
as
a
crowd
could
they
be
said
to
dominate
the
environment
,
as
one
comes
to
dominate
a
work
of
art
he
may
possess
,
no
matter
how
esoteric
,
no
one
knew
what
this
room
meant
because
it
was
evolving
into
something
else
,
becoming
everything
a
room
was
not
;
to
exist
in
it
was
as
difficult
as
walking
on
a
highly
polished
moving
stairway
,
and
no
one
could
succeed
at
all
save
with
the
aforementioned
qualities
of
a
hand
moving
among
broken
glass
--
which
qualities
limited
and
defined
the
majority
of
those
present
.
These
were
of
two
sorts
.
There
were
the
Americans
and
English
who
had
been
dissipating
all
spring
and
summer
,
so
that
now
everything
they
did
had
a
purely
nervous
inspiration
.
They
were
very
quiet
and
lethargic
at
certain
hours
and
then
they
exploded
into
sudden
quarrels
and
breakdowns
and
seductions
.
The
other
class
,
who
might
be
called
the
exploiters
,
was
formed
by
the
sponges
,
who
were
sober
,
serious
people
by
comparison
,
with
a
purpose
in
life
and
no
time
for
fooling
.
These
kept
their
balance
best
in
that
environment
,
and
what
tone
there
was
,
beyond
the
apartment
's
novel
organization
of
light
values
,
came
from
them
.
The
Frankenstein
took
down
Dick
and
Rosemary
at
a
gulp
--
it
separated
them
immediately
and
Rosemary
suddenly
discovered
herself
to
be
an
insincere
little
person
,
living
all
in
the
upper
registers
of
her
throat
and
wishing
the
director
would
come
.
There
was
however
such
a
wild
beating
of
wings
in
the
room
that
she
did
not
feel
her
position
was
more
incongruous
than
any
one
else
's
.
In
addition
,
her
training
told
and
after
a
series
of
semi-military
turns
,
shifts
,
and
marches
she
found
herself
presumably
talking
to
a
neat
,
slick
girl
with
a
lovely
boy
's
face
,
but
actually
absorbed
by
a
conversation
taking
place
on
a
sort
of
gun-metal
ladder
diagonally
opposite
her
and
four
feet
away
.
There
was
a
trio
of
young
women
sitting
on
the
bench
.
They
were
all
tall
and
slender
with
small
heads
groomed
like
manikins
'
heads
,
and
as
they
talked
the
heads
waved
gracefully
about
above
their
dark
tailored
suits
,
rather
like
long-stemmed
flowers
and
rather
like
cobras
'
hoods
.
``
Oh
,
they
give
a
good
show
,
''
said
one
of
them
,
in
a
deep
rich
voice
.
``
Practically
the
best
show
in
Paris
--
I
'd
be
the
last
one
to
deny
that
.
But
after
all
--
''
She
sighed
.
``
Those
phrases
he
uses
over
and
over
--
'Oldest
inhabitant
gnawed
by
rodents
.
'
You
laugh
once
.
''
``
I
prefer
people
whose
lives
have
more
corrugated
surfaces
,
''
said
the
second
,
``
and
I
do
n't
like
her
.
''
``
I
've
never
really
been
able
to
get
very
excited
about
them
,
or
their
entourage
either
.
Why
,
for
example
,
the
entirely
liquid
Mr
.
North
?
''
``
He
's
out
,
''
said
the
first
girl
.
``
But
you
must
admit
that
the
party
in
question
can
be
one
of
the
most
charming
human
beings
you
have
ever
met
.
''
It
was
the
first
hint
Rosemary
had
had
that
they
were
talking
about
the
Divers
,
and
her
body
grew
tense
with
indignation
.
But
the
girl
talking
to
her
,
in
the
starched
blue
shirt
with
the
bright
blue
eyes
and
the
red
cheeks
and
the
very
gray
suit
,
a
poster
of
a
girl
,
had
begun
to
play
up
.
Desperately
she
kept
sweeping
things
from
between
them
,
afraid
that
Rosemary
could
n't
see
her
,
sweeping
them
away
until
presently
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
veil
of
brittle
humor
hiding
the
girl
,
and
with
distaste
Rosemary
saw
her
plain
.
``
Could
n't
you
have
lunch
,
or
maybe
dinner
,
or
lunch
the
day
after
?
''
begged
the
girl
.
Rosemary
looked
about
for
Dick
,
finding
him
with
the
hostess
,
to
whom
he
had
been
talking
since
they
came
in
.
Their
eyes
met
and
he
nodded
slightly
,
and
simultaneously
the
three
cobra
women
noticed
her
;
their
long
necks
darted
toward
her
and
they
fixed
finely
critical
glances
upon
her
.
She
looked
back
at
them
defiantly
,
acknowledging
that
she
had
heard
what
they
said
.
Then
she
threw
off
her
exigent
vis-à-vis
with
a
polite
but
clipped
parting
that
she
had
just
learned
from
Dick
,
and
went
over
to
join
him
.
The
hostess
--
she
was
another
tall
rich
American
girl
,
promenading
insouciantly
upon
the
national
prosperity
--
was
asking
Dick
innumerable
questions
about
Gausse
's
Hôtel
,
whither
she
evidently
wanted
to
come
,
and
battering
persistently
against
his
reluctance
.
Rosemary
's
presence
reminded
her
that
she
had
been
recalcitrant
as
a
hostess
and
glancing
about
she
said
:
``
Have
you
met
any
one
amusing
,
have
you
met
Mr.
--
''
Her
eyes
groped
for
a
male
who
might
interest
Rosemary
,
but
Dick
said
they
must
go
.
They
left
immediately
,
moving
over
the
brief
threshold
of
the
future
to
the
sudden
past
of
the
stone
façade
without
.
``
Was
n't
it
terrible
?
''
he
said
.
``
Terrible
,
''
she
echoed
obediently
.
``
Rosemary
?
''
She
murmured
,
``
What
?
''
in
an
awed
voice
.
``
I
feel
terribly
about
this
.
''
She
was
shaken
with
audibly
painful
sobs
.
``
Have
you
got
a
handkerchief
?
''
she
faltered
.
But
there
was
little
time
to
cry
,
and
lovers
now
they
fell
ravenously
on
the
quick
seconds
while
outside
the
taxi
windows
the
green
and
cream
twilight
faded
,
and
the
fire-red
,
gas-blue
,
ghost-green
signs
began
to
shine
smokily
through
the
tranquil
rain
.
It
was
nearly
six
,
the
streets
were
in
movement
,
the
bistros
gleamed
,
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
moved
by
in
pink
majesty
as
the
cab
turned
north
.
They
looked
at
each
other
at
last
,
murmuring
names
that
were
a
spell
.
Softly
the
two
names
lingered
on
the
air
,
died
away
more
slowly
than
other
words
,
other
names
,
slower
than
music
in
the
mind
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
came
over
me
last
night
,
''
Rosemary
said
.
``
That
glass
of
champagne
?
I
've
never
done
anything
like
that
before
.
''
``
You
simply
said
you
loved
me
.
''
``
I
do
love
you
--
I
ca
n't
change
that
.
''
It
was
time
for
Rosemary
to
cry
,
so
she
cried
a
little
in
her
handkerchief
.
``
I
'm
afraid
I
'm
in
love
with
you
,
''
said
Dick
,
``
and
that
's
not
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
.
''
Again
the
names
--
then
they
lurched
together
as
if
the
taxi
had
swung
them
.
Her
breasts
crushed
flat
against
him
,
her
mouth
was
all
new
and
warm
,
owned
in
common
.
They
stopped
thinking
with
an
almost
painful
relief
,
stopped
seeing
;
they
only
breathed
and
sought
each
other
.
They
were
both
in
the
gray
gentle
world
of
a
mild
hangover
of
fatigue
when
the
nerves
relax
in
bunches
like
piano
strings
,
and
crackle
suddenly
like
wicker
chairs
.
Nerves
so
raw
and
tender
must
surely
join
other
nerves
,
lips
to
lips
,
breast
to
breast
.
.
.
.
They
were
still
in
the
happier
stage
of
love
.
They
were
full
of
brave
illusions
about
each
other
,
tremendous
illusions
,
so
that
the
communion
of
self
with
self
seemed
to
be
on
a
plane
where
no
other
human
relations
mattered
.
They
both
seemed
to
have
arrived
there
with
an
extraordinary
innocence
as
though
a
series
of
pure
accidents
had
driven
them
together
,
so
many
accidents
that
at
last
they
were
forced
to
conclude
that
they
were
for
each
other
.
They
had
arrived
with
clean
hands
,
or
so
it
seemed
,
after
no
traffic
with
the
merely
curious
and
clandestine
.
But
for
Dick
that
portion
of
the
road
was
short
;
the
turning
came
before
they
reached
the
hotel
.
``
There
's
nothing
to
do
about
it
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
feeling
of
panic
.
``
I
'm
in
love
with
you
but
it
does
n't
change
what
I
said
last
night
.
''
``
That
does
n't
matter
now
.
I
just
wanted
to
make
you
love
me
--
if
you
love
me
everything
's
all
right
.
''
``
Unfortunately
I
do
.
But
Nicole
must
n't
know
--
she
must
n't
suspect
even
faintly
.
Nicole
and
I
have
got
to
go
on
together
.
In
a
way
that
's
more
important
than
just
wanting
to
go
on
.
''
``
Kiss
me
once
more
.
''
He
kissed
her
,
but
momentarily
he
had
left
her
.
``
Nicole
must
n't
suffer
--
she
loves
me
and
I
love
her
--
you
understand
that
.
''
She
did
understand
--
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
she
understood
well
,
not
hurting
people
.
She
knew
the
Divers
loved
each
other
because
it
had
been
her
primary
assumption
.
She
had
thought
however
that
it
was
a
rather
cooled
relation
,
and
actually
rather
like
the
love
of
herself
and
her
mother
.
When
people
have
so
much
for
outsiders
did
n't
it
indicate
a
lack
of
inner
intensity
?
``
And
I
mean
love
,
''
he
said
,
guessing
her
thoughts
.
``
Active
love
--
it
's
more
complicated
than
I
can
tell
you
.
It
was
responsible
for
that
crazy
duel
.
''
``
How
did
you
know
about
the
duel
?
I
thought
we
were
to
keep
it
from
you
.
''
``
Do
you
think
Abe
can
keep
a
secret
?
''
He
spoke
with
incisive
irony
.
``
Tell
a
secret
over
the
radio
,
publish
it
in
a
tabloid
,
but
never
tell
it
to
a
man
who
drinks
more
than
three
or
four
a
day
.
''
She
laughed
in
agreement
,
staying
close
to
him
.
``
So
you
understand
my
relations
with
Nicole
are
complicated
.
She
's
not
very
strong
--
she
looks
strong
but
she
is
n't
.
And
this
makes
rather
a
mess
.
''
``
Oh
,
say
that
later
!
But
kiss
me
now
--
love
me
now
.
I
'll
love
you
and
never
let
Nicole
see
.
''
``
You
darling
.
''
They
reached
the
hotel
and
Rosemary
walked
a
little
behind
him
,
to
admire
him
,
to
adore
him
.
His
step
was
alert
as
if
he
had
just
come
from
some
great
doings
and
was
hurrying
on
toward
others
.
Organizer
of
private
gaiety
,
curator
of
a
richly
incrusted
happiness
.
His
hat
was
a
perfect
hat
and
he
carried
a
heavy
stick
and
yellow
gloves
.
She
thought
what
a
good
time
they
would
all
have
being
with
him
to-night
.
They
walked
upstairs
--
five
flights
.
At
the
first
landing
they
stopped
and
kissed
;
she
was
careful
on
the
next
landing
,
on
the
third
more
careful
still
.
On
the
next
--
there
were
two
more
--
she
stopped
half
way
and
kissed
him
fleetingly
good-by
.
At
his
urgency
she
walked
down
with
him
to
the
one
below
for
a
minute
--
and
then
up
and
up
.
Finally
it
was
good-by
with
their
hands
stretching
to
touch
along
the
diagonal
of
the
banister
and
then
the
fingers
slipping
apart
.
Dick
went
back
downstairs
to
make
some
arrangements
for
the
evening
--
Rosemary
ran
to
her
room
and
wrote
a
letter
to
her
mother
;
she
was
conscience-stricken
because
she
did
not
miss
her
mother
at
all
.
XVIII
Although
the
Divers
were
honestly
apathetic
to
organized
fashion
,
they
were
nevertheless
too
acute
to
abandon
its
contemporaneous
rhythm
and
beat
--
Dick
's
parties
were
all
concerned
with
excitement
,
and
a
chance
breath
of
fresh
night
air
was
the
more
precious
for
being
experienced
in
the
intervals
of
the
excitement
.
The
party
that
night
moved
with
the
speed
of
a
slapstick
comedy
.
They
were
twelve
,
they
were
sixteen
,
they
were
quartets
in
separate
motors
bound
on
a
quick
Odyssey
over
Paris
.
Everything
had
been
foreseen
.
People
joined
them
as
if
by
magic
,
accompanied
them
as
specialists
,
almost
guides
,
through
a
phase
of
the
evening
,
dropped
out
and
were
succeeded
by
other
people
,
so
that
it
appeared
as
if
the
freshness
of
each
one
had
been
husbanded
for
them
all
day
.
Rosemary
appreciated
how
different
it
was
from
any
party
in
Hollywood
,
no
matter
how
splendid
in
scale
.
There
was
,
among
many
diversions
,
the
car
of
the
Shah
of
Persia
.
Where
Dick
had
commandeered
this
vehicle
,
what
bribery
was
employed
,
these
were
facts
of
irrelevance
.
Rosemary
accepted
it
as
merely
a
new
facet
of
the
fabulous
,
which
for
two
years
had
filled
her
life
.
The
car
had
been
built
on
a
special
chassis
in
America
.
Its
wheels
were
of
silver
,
so
was
the
radiator
.
The
inside
of
the
body
was
inlaid
with
innumerable
brilliants
which
would
be
replaced
with
true
gems
by
the
court
jeweller
when
the
car
arrived
in
Teheran
the
following
week
.
There
was
only
one
real
seat
in
back
,
because
the
Shah
must
ride
alone
,
so
they
took
turns
riding
in
it
and
sitting
on
the
marten
fur
that
covered
the
floor
.
But
always
there
was
Dick
.
Rosemary
assured
the
image
of
her
mother
,
ever
carried
with
her
,
that
never
,
never
had
she
known
any
one
so
nice
,
so
thoroughly
nice
as
Dick
was
that
night
.
She
compared
him
with
the
two
Englishmen
,
whom
Abe
addressed
conscientiously
as
``
Major
Hengest
and
Mr.
Horsa
,
''
and
with
the
heir
to
a
Scandinavian
throne
and
the
novelist
just
back
from
Russia
,
and
with
Abe
,
who
was
desperate
and
witty
,
and
with
Collis
Clay
,
who
joined
them
somewhere
and
stayed
along
--
and
felt
there
was
no
comparison
.
The
enthusiasm
,
the
selflessness
behind
the
whole
performance
ravished
her
,
the
technic
of
moving
many
varied
types
,
each
as
immobile
,
as
dependent
on
supplies
of
attention
as
an
infantry
battalion
is
dependent
on
rations
,
appeared
so
effortless
that
he
still
had
pieces
of
his
own
most
personal
self
for
everyone
.
--
Afterward
she
remembered
the
times
when
she
had
felt
the
happiest
.
The
first
time
was
when
she
and
Dick
danced
together
and
she
felt
her
beauty
sparkling
bright
against
his
tall
,
strong
form
as
they
floated
,
hovering
like
people
in
an
amusing
dream
--
he
turned
her
here
and
there
with
such
a
delicacy
of
suggestion
that
she
was
like
a
bright
bouquet
,
a
piece
of
precious
cloth
being
displayed
before
fifty
eyes
.
There
was
a
moment
when
they
were
not
dancing
at
all
,
simply
clinging
together
.
Some
time
in
the
early
morning
they
were
alone
,
and
her
damp
powdery
young
body
came
up
close
to
him
in
a
crush
of
tired
cloth
,
and
stayed
there
,
crushed
against
a
background
of
other
people
's
hats
and
wraps
.
.
.
.
The
time
she
laughed
most
was
later
,
when
six
of
them
,
the
best
of
them
,
noblest
relics
of
the
evening
,
stood
in
the
dusky
front
lobby
of
the
Ritz
telling
the
night
concierge
that
General
Pershing
was
outside
and
wanted
caviare
and
champagne
.
``
He
brooks
no
delay
.
Every
man
,
every
gun
is
at
his
service
.
''
Frantic
waiters
emerged
from
nowhere
,
a
table
was
set
in
the
lobby
,
and
Abe
came
in
representing
General
Pershing
while
they
stood
up
and
mumbled
remembered
fragments
of
war
songs
at
him
.
In
the
waiters
'
injured
reaction
to
this
anti-climax
they
found
themselves
neglected
,
so
they
built
a
waiter
trap
--
a
huge
and
fantastic
device
constructed
of
all
the
furniture
in
the
lobby
and
functioning
like
one
of
the
bizarre
machines
of
a
Goldberg
cartoon
.
Abe
shook
his
head
doubtfully
at
it
.
``
Perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
steal
a
musical
saw
and
--
''
``
That
's
enough
,
''
Mary
interrupted
.
``
When
Abe
begins
bringing
up
that
it
's
time
to
go
home
.
''
Anxiously
she
confided
to
Rosemary
:
``
I
've
got
to
get
Abe
home
.
His
boat
train
leaves
at
eleven
.
It
's
so
important
--
I
feel
the
whole
future
depends
on
his
catching
it
,
but
whenever
I
argue
with
him
he
does
the
exact
opposite
.
''
``
I
'll
try
and
persuade
him
,
''
offered
Rosemary
.
``
Would
you
?
''
Mary
said
doubtfully
.
``
Maybe
you
could
.
''
Then
Dick
came
up
to
Rosemary
:
``
Nicole
and
I
are
going
home
and
we
thought
you
'd
want
to
go
with
us
.
''
Her
face
was
pale
with
fatigue
in
the
false
dawn
.
Two
wan
dark
spots
in
her
cheek
marked
where
the
color
was
by
day
.
``
I
ca
n't
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
promised
Mary
North
to
stay
along
with
them
--
or
Abe
'll
never
go
to
bed
.
Maybe
you
could
do
something
.
''
``
Do
n't
you
know
you
ca
n't
do
anything
about
people
?
''
he
advised
her
.
``
If
Abe
was
my
room-mate
in
college
,
tight
for
the
first
time
,
it
'd
be
different
.
Now
there
's
nothing
to
do
.
''
``
Well
,
I
've
got
to
stay
.
He
says
he
'll
go
to
bed
if
we
only
come
to
the
Halles
with
him
,
''
she
said
,
almost
defiantly
.
He
kissed
the
inside
of
her
elbow
quickly
.
``
Do
n't
let
Rosemary
go
home
alone
,
''
Nicole
called
to
Mary
as
they
left
.
``
We
feel
responsible
to
her
mother
.
''
--
Later
Rosemary
and
the
Norths
and
a
manufacturer
of
dolls
'
voices
from
Newark
and
ubiquitous
Collis
and
a
big
splendidly
dressed
oil
Indian
named
George
T.
Horseprotection
were
riding
along
on
top
of
thousands
of
carrots
in
a
market
wagon
.
The
earth
in
the
carrot
beards
was
fragrant
and
sweet
in
the
darkness
,
and
Rosemary
was
so
high
up
in
the
load
that
she
could
hardly
see
the
others
in
the
long
shadow
between
infrequent
street
lamps
.
Their
voices
came
from
far
off
,
as
if
they
were
having
experiences
different
from
hers
,
different
and
far
away
,
for
she
was
with
Dick
in
her
heart
,
sorry
she
had
come
with
the
Norths
,
wishing
she
was
at
the
hotel
and
him
asleep
across
the
hall
,
or
that
he
was
here
beside
her
with
the
warm
darkness
streaming
down
.
``
Do
n't
come
up
,
''
she
called
to
Collis
,
``
the
carrots
will
all
roll
.
''
She
threw
one
at
Abe
who
was
sitting
beside
the
driver
,
stiffly
like
an
old
man
.
.
.
.
Later
she
was
homeward
bound
at
last
in
broad
daylight
,
with
the
pigeons
already
breaking
over
Saint-Sulpice
.
All
of
them
began
to
laugh
spontaneously
because
they
knew
it
was
still
last
night
while
the
people
in
the
streets
had
the
delusion
that
it
was
bright
hot
morning
.
``
At
last
I
've
been
on
a
wild
party
,
''
thought
Rosemary
,
``
but
it
's
no
fun
when
Dick
is
n't
there
.
''
She
felt
a
little
betrayed
and
sad
,
but
presently
a
moving
object
came
into
sight
.
It
was
a
huge
horse-chestnut
tree
in
full
bloom
bound
for
the
Champs
Élysées
,
strapped
now
into
a
long
truck
and
simply
shaking
with
laughter
--
like
a
lovely
person
in
an
undignified
position
yet
confident
none
the
less
of
being
lovely
.
Looking
at
it
with
fascination
Rosemary
identified
herself
with
it
,
and
laughed
cheerfully
with
it
,
and
everything
all
at
once
seemed
gorgeous
.
XIX
Abe
left
from
the
Gare
Saint
Lazare
at
eleven
--
he
stood
alone
under
the
fouled
glass
dome
,
relic
of
the
seventies
,
era
of
the
Crystal
Palace
;
his
hands
,
of
that
vague
gray
color
that
only
twenty-four
hours
can
produce
,
were
in
his
coat
pockets
to
conceal
the
trembling
fingers
.
With
his
hat
removed
it
was
plain
that
only
the
top
layer
of
his
hair
was
brushed
back
--
the
lower
levels
were
pointed
resolutely
sidewise
.
He
was
scarcely
recognizable
as
the
man
who
had
swum
upon
Gausse
's
Beach
a
fortnight
ago
.
He
was
early
;
he
looked
from
left
to
right
with
his
eyes
only
;
it
would
have
taken
nervous
forces
out
of
his
control
to
use
any
other
part
of
his
body
.
New-looking
baggage
went
past
him
;
presently
prospective
passengers
,
with
dark
little
bodies
,
were
calling
:
``
Jew-uls-Hoo-oo
!
''
in
dark
piercing
voices
.
At
the
minute
when
he
wondered
whether
or
not
he
had
time
for
a
drink
at
the
buffet
,
and
began
clutching
at
the
soggy
wad
of
thousand-franc
notes
in
his
pocket
,
one
end
of
his
pendulous
glance
came
to
rest
upon
the
apparition
of
Nicole
at
the
stairhead
.
He
watched
her
--
she
was
self-revelatory
in
her
little
expressions
as
people
seem
to
some
one
waiting
for
them
,
who
as
yet
is
himself
unobserved
.
She
was
frowning
,
thinking
of
her
children
,
less
gloating
over
them
than
merely
animally
counting
them
--
a
cat
checking
her
cubs
with
a
paw
.
When
she
saw
Abe
,
the
mood
passed
out
of
her
face
;
the
glow
of
the
morning
skylight
was
sad
,
and
Abe
made
a
gloomy
figure
with
dark
circles
that
showed
through
the
crimson
tan
under
his
eyes
.
They
sat
down
on
a
bench
.
``
I
came
because
you
asked
me
,
''
said
Nicole
defensively
.
Abe
seemed
to
have
forgotten
why
he
asked
her
and
Nicole
was
quite
content
to
look
at
the
travellers
passing
by
.
``
That
's
going
to
be
the
belle
of
your
boat
--
that
one
with
all
the
men
to
say
good-by
--
you
see
why
she
bought
that
dress
?
''
Nicole
talked
faster
and
faster
.
``
You
see
why
nobody
else
would
buy
it
except
the
belle
of
the
world
cruise
?
See
?
No
?
Wake
up
!
That
's
a
story
dress
--
that
extra
material
tells
a
story
and
somebody
on
world
cruise
would
be
lonesome
enough
to
want
to
hear
it
.
''
She
bit
close
her
last
words
;
she
had
talked
too
much
for
her
;
and
Abe
found
it
difficult
to
gather
from
her
serious
set
face
that
she
had
spoken
at
all
.
With
an
effort
he
drew
himself
up
to
a
posture
that
looked
as
if
he
were
standing
up
while
he
was
sitting
down
.
``
The
afternoon
you
took
me
to
that
funny
ball
--
you
know
,
St.
Genevieve
's
--
''
he
began
.
``
I
remember
.
It
was
fun
,
was
n't
it
?
''
``
No
fun
for
me
.
I
have
n't
had
fun
seeing
you
this
time
.
I
'm
tired
of
you
both
,
but
it
does
n't
show
because
you
're
even
more
tired
of
me
--
you
know
what
I
mean
.
If
I
had
any
enthusiasm
,
I
'd
go
on
to
new
people
.
''
There
was
a
rough
nap
on
Nicole
's
velvet
gloves
as
she
slapped
him
back
:
``
Seems
rather
foolish
to
be
unpleasant
,
Abe
.
Anyhow
you
do
n't
mean
that
.
I
ca
n't
see
why
you
've
given
up
about
everything
.
''
Abe
considered
,
trying
hard
not
to
cough
or
blow
his
nose
.
``
I
suppose
I
got
bored
;
and
then
it
was
such
a
long
way
to
go
back
in
order
to
get
anywhere
.
''
Often
a
man
can
play
the
helpless
child
in
front
of
a
woman
,
but
he
can
almost
never
bring
it
off
when
he
feels
most
like
a
helpless
child
.
``
No
excuse
for
it
,
''
Nicole
said
crisply
.
Abe
was
feeling
worse
every
minute
--
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
disagreeable
and
sheerly
nervous
remarks
.
Nicole
thought
that
the
correct
attitude
for
her
was
to
sit
staring
straight
ahead
,
hands
in
her
lap
.
For
a
while
there
was
no
communication
between
them
--
each
was
racing
away
from
the
other
,
breathing
only
insofar
as
there
was
blue
space
ahead
,
a
sky
not
seen
by
the
other
.
Unlike
lovers
they
possessed
no
past
;
unlike
man
and
wife
,
they
possessed
no
future
;
yet
up
to
this
morning
Nicole
had
liked
Abe
better
than
any
one
except
Dick
--
and
he
had
been
heavy
,
belly-frightened
,
with
love
for
her
for
years
.
``
Tired
of
women
's
worlds
,
''
he
spoke
up
suddenly
.
``
Then
why
do
n't
you
make
a
world
of
your
own
?
''
``
Tired
of
friends
.
The
thing
is
to
have
sycophants
.
''
Nicole
tried
to
force
the
minute
hand
around
on
the
station
clock
,
but
,
``
You
agree
?
''
he
demanded
.
``
I
am
a
woman
and
my
business
is
to
hold
things
together
.
''
``
My
business
is
to
tear
them
apart
.
''
``
When
you
get
drunk
you
do
n't
tear
anything
apart
except
yourself
,
''
she
said
,
cold
now
,
and
frightened
and
unconfident
.
The
station
was
filling
but
no
one
she
knew
came
.
After
a
moment
her
eyes
fell
gratefully
on
a
tall
girl
with
straw
hair
like
a
helmet
,
who
was
dropping
letters
in
the
mail
slot
.
``
A
girl
I
have
to
speak
to
,
Abe
.
Abe
,
wake
up
!
You
fool
!
''
Patiently
Abe
followed
her
with
his
eyes
.
The
woman
turned
in
a
startled
way
to
greet
Nicole
,
and
Abe
recognized
her
as
some
one
he
had
seen
around
Paris
.
He
took
advantage
of
Nicole
's
absence
to
cough
hard
and
retchingly
into
his
handkerchief
,
and
to
blow
his
nose
loud
.
The
morning
was
warmer
and
his
underwear
was
soaked
with
sweat
.
His
fingers
trembled
so
violently
that
it
took
four
matches
to
light
a
cigarette
;
it
seemed
absolutely
necessary
to
make
his
way
into
the
buffet
for
a
drink
,
but
immediately
Nicole
returned
.
``
That
was
a
mistake
,
''
she
said
with
frosty
humor
.
``
After
begging
me
to
come
and
see
her
,
she
gave
me
a
good
snubbing
.
She
looked
at
me
as
if
I
were
rotted
.
''
Excited
,
she
did
a
little
laugh
,
as
with
two
fingers
high
in
the
scales
.
``
Let
people
come
to
you
.
''
Abe
recovered
from
a
cigarette
cough
and
remarked
:
``
Trouble
is
when
you
're
sober
you
do
n't
want
to
see
anybody
,
and
when
you
're
tight
nobody
wants
to
see
you
.
''
``
Who
,
me
?
''
Nicole
laughed
again
;
for
some
reason
the
late
encounter
had
cheered
her
.
``
No
--
me
.
''
``
Speak
for
yourself
.
I
like
people
,
a
lot
of
people
--
I
like
--
''
Rosemary
and
Mary
North
came
in
sight
,
walking
slowly
and
searching
for
Abe
,
and
Nicole
burst
forth
grossly
with
``
Hey
!
Hi
!
Hey
!
''
and
laughed
and
waved
the
package
of
handkerchiefs
she
had
bought
for
Abe
.
They
stood
in
an
uncomfortable
little
group
weighted
down
by
Abe
's
gigantic
presence
:
he
lay
athwart
them
like
the
wreck
of
a
galleon
,
dominating
with
his
presence
his
own
weakness
and
self-indulgence
,
his
narrowness
and
bitterness
.
All
of
them
were
conscious
of
the
solemn
dignity
that
flowed
from
him
,
of
his
achievement
,
fragmentary
,
suggestive
and
surpassed
.
But
they
were
frightened
at
his
survivant
will
,
once
a
will
to
live
,
now
become
a
will
to
die
.
Dick
Diver
came
and
brought
with
him
a
fine
glowing
surface
on
which
the
three
women
sprang
like
monkeys
with
cries
of
relief
,
perching
on
his
shoulders
,
on
the
beautiful
crown
of
his
hat
or
the
gold
head
of
his
cane
.
Now
,
for
a
moment
,
they
could
disregard
the
spectacle
of
Abe
's
gigantic
obscenity
.
Dick
saw
the
situation
quickly
and
grasped
it
quietly
.
He
pulled
them
out
of
themselves
into
the
station
,
making
plain
its
wonders
.
Nearby
,
some
Americans
were
saying
good-by
in
voices
that
mimicked
the
cadence
of
water
running
into
a
large
old
bathtub
.
Standing
in
the
station
,
with
Paris
in
back
of
them
,
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
vicariously
leaning
a
little
over
the
ocean
,
already
undergoing
a
sea-change
,
a
shifting
about
of
atoms
to
form
the
essential
molecule
of
a
new
people
.
So
the
well-to-do
Americans
poured
through
the
station
onto
the
platforms
with
frank
new
faces
,
intelligent
,
considerate
,
thoughtless
,
thought-for
.
An
occasional
English
face
among
them
seemed
sharp
and
emergent
.
When
there
were
enough
Americans
on
the
platform
the
first
impression
of
their
immaculacy
and
their
money
began
to
fade
into
a
vague
racial
dusk
that
hindered
and
blinded
both
them
and
their
observers
.
Nicole
seized
Dick
's
arm
crying
,
``
Look
!
''
Dick
turned
in
time
to
see
what
took
place
in
half
a
minute
.
At
a
Pullman
entrance
two
cars
off
,
a
vivid
scene
detached
itself
from
the
tenor
of
many
farewells
.
The
young
woman
with
the
helmet-like
hair
to
whom
Nicole
had
spoken
made
an
odd
dodging
little
run
away
from
the
man
to
whom
she
was
talking
and
plunged
a
frantic
hand
into
her
purse
;
then
the
sound
of
two
revolver
shots
cracked
the
narrow
air
of
the
platform
.
Simultaneously
the
engine
whistled
sharply
and
the
train
began
to
move
,
momentarily
dwarfing
the
shots
in
significance
.
Abe
waved
again
from
his
window
,
oblivious
to
what
had
happened
.
But
before
the
crowd
closed
in
,
the
others
had
seen
the
shots
take
effect
,
seen
the
target
sit
down
upon
the
platform
.
Only
after
a
hundred
years
did
the
train
stop
;
Nicole
,
Mary
,
and
Rosemary
waited
on
the
outskirts
while
Dick
fought
his
way
through
.
It
was
five
minutes
before
he
found
them
again
--
by
this
time
the
crowd
had
split
into
two
sections
,
following
,
respectively
,
the
man
on
a
stretcher
and
the
girl
walking
pale
and
firm
between
distraught
gendarmes
.
``
It
was
Maria
Wallis
,
''
Dick
said
hurriedly
.
``
The
man
she
shot
was
an
Englishman
--
they
had
an
awful
time
finding
out
who
,
because
she
shot
him
through
his
identification
card
.
''
They
were
walking
quickly
from
the
train
,
swayed
along
with
the
crowd
.
``
I
found
out
what
poste
de
police
they
're
taking
her
to
so
I
'll
go
there
--
''
``
But
her
sister
lives
in
Paris
,
''
Nicole
objected
.
``
Why
not
phone
her
?
Seems
very
peculiar
nobody
thought
of
that
.
She
's
married
to
a
Frenchman
,
and
he
can
do
more
than
we
can
.
''
Dick
hesitated
,
shook
his
head
and
started
off
.
``
Wait
!
''
Nicole
cried
after
him
.
``
That
's
foolish
--
how
can
you
do
any
good
--
with
your
French
?
''
``
At
least
I
'll
see
they
do
n't
do
anything
outrageous
to
her
.
''
``
They
're
certainly
going
to
hold
on
to
her
,
''
Nicole
assured
him
briskly
.
``
She
did
shoot
the
man
.
The
best
thing
is
to
phone
right
away
to
Laura
--
she
can
do
more
than
we
can
.
''
Dick
was
unconvinced
--
also
he
was
showing
off
for
Rosemary
.
``
You
wait
,
''
said
Nicole
firmly
,
and
hurried
off
to
a
telephone
booth
.
``
When
Nicole
takes
things
into
her
hands
,
''
he
said
with
affectionate
irony
,
``
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
.
''
He
saw
Rosemary
for
the
first
time
that
morning
.
They
exchanged
glances
,
trying
to
recognize
the
emotions
of
the
day
before
.
For
a
moment
each
seemed
unreal
to
the
other
--
then
the
slow
warm
hum
of
love
began
again
.
``
You
like
to
help
everybody
,
do
n't
you
?
''
Rosemary
said
.
``
I
only
pretend
to
.
''
``
Mother
likes
to
help
everybody
--
of
course
she
ca
n't
help
as
many
people
as
you
do
.
''
She
sighed
.
``
Sometimes
I
think
I
'm
the
most
selfish
person
in
the
world
.
''
For
the
first
time
the
mention
of
her
mother
annoyed
rather
than
amused
Dick
.
He
wanted
to
sweep
away
her
mother
,
remove
the
whole
affair
from
the
nursery
footing
upon
which
Rosemary
persistently
established
it
.
But
he
realized
that
this
impulse
was
a
loss
of
control
--
what
would
become
of
Rosemary
's
urge
toward
him
if
,
for
even
a
moment
,
he
relaxed
.
He
saw
,
not
without
panic
,
that
the
affair
was
sliding
to
rest
;
it
could
not
stand
still
,
it
must
go
on
or
go
back
;
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
him
that
Rosemary
had
her
hand
on
the
lever
more
authoritatively
than
he
.
Before
he
had
thought
out
a
course
of
procedure
,
Nicole
returned
.
``
I
found
Laura
.
It
was
the
first
news
she
had
and
her
voice
kept
fading
away
and
then
getting
loud
again
--
as
if
she
was
fainting
and
then
pulling
herself
together
.
She
said
she
knew
something
was
going
to
happen
this
morning
.
''
``
Maria
ought
to
be
with
Diaghileff
,
''
said
Dick
in
a
gentle
tone
,
in
order
to
bring
them
back
to
quietude
.
``
She
has
a
nice
sense
of
decor
--
not
to
say
rhythm
.
Will
any
of
us
ever
see
a
train
pulling
out
without
hearing
a
few
shots
?
''
They
bumped
down
the
wide
steel
steps
.
``
I
'm
sorry
for
the
poor
man
,
''
Nicole
said
.
``
Course
that
's
why
she
talked
so
strange
to
me
--
she
was
getting
ready
to
open
fire
.
''
She
laughed
,
Rosemary
laughed
too
,
but
they
were
both
horrified
,
and
both
of
them
deeply
wanted
Dick
to
make
a
moral
comment
on
the
matter
and
not
leave
it
to
them
.
This
wish
was
not
entirely
conscious
,
especially
on
the
part
of
Rosemary
,
who
was
accustomed
to
having
shell
fragments
of
such
events
shriek
past
her
head
.
But
a
totality
of
shock
had
piled
up
in
her
too
.
For
the
moment
,
Dick
was
too
shaken
by
the
impetus
of
his
newly
recognized
emotion
to
resolve
things
into
the
pattern
of
the
holiday
,
so
the
women
,
missing
something
,
lapsed
into
a
vague
unhappiness
.
Then
,
as
if
nothing
had
happened
,
the
lives
of
the
Divers
and
their
friends
flowed
out
into
the
street
.
However
,
everything
had
happened
--
Abe
's
departure
and
Mary
's
impending
departure
for
Salzburg
this
afternoon
had
ended
the
time
in
Paris
.
Or
perhaps
the
shots
,
the
concussions
that
had
finished
God
knew
what
dark
matter
,
had
terminated
it
.
The
shots
had
entered
into
all
their
lives
:
echoes
of
violence
followed
them
out
onto
the
pavement
where
two
porters
held
a
post-mortem
beside
them
as
they
waited
for
a
taxi
.
``
Tu
as
vu
le
revolver
?
Il
était
très
petit
,
vraie
perle
--
un
jouet
.
''
``
Mais
,
assez
puissant
!
''
said
the
other
porter
sagely
.
``
Tu
as
vu
sa
chemise
?
Assez
de
sang
pour
se
croire
à
la
guerre
.
''
XX
In
the
square
,
as
they
came
out
,
a
suspended
mass
of
gasoline
exhaust
cooked
slowly
in
the
July
sun
.
It
was
a
terrible
thing
--
unlike
pure
heat
it
held
no
promise
of
rural
escape
but
suggested
only
roads
choked
with
the
same
foul
asthma
.
During
their
luncheon
,
outdoors
,
across
from
the
Luxembourg
Gardens
,
Rosemary
had
cramps
and
felt
fretful
and
full
of
impatient
lassitude
--
it
was
the
foretaste
of
this
that
had
inspired
her
self-accusation
of
selfishness
in
the
station
.
Dick
had
no
suspicion
of
the
sharpness
of
the
change
;
he
was
profoundly
unhappy
and
the
subsequent
increase
of
egotism
tended
momentarily
to
blind
him
to
what
was
going
on
round
about
him
,
and
deprive
him
of
the
long
ground-swell
of
imagination
that
he
counted
on
for
his
judgments
.
After
Mary
North
left
them
,
accompanied
by
the
Italian
singing
teacher
who
had
joined
them
for
coffee
and
was
taking
her
to
her
train
,
Rosemary
,
too
,
stood
up
,
bound
for
an
engagement
at
her
studio
:
``
meet
some
officials
.
''
``
And
oh
--
''
she
proposed
``
--
if
Collis
Clay
,
that
Southern
boy
--
if
he
comes
while
you
are
still
sitting
here
,
just
tell
him
I
could
n't
wait
;
tell
him
to
call
me
to-morrow
.
''
Too
insouciant
,
in
reaction
from
the
late
disturbance
,
she
had
assumed
the
privileges
of
a
child
--
the
result
being
to
remind
the
Divers
of
their
exclusive
love
for
their
own
children
;
Rosemary
was
sharply
rebuked
in
a
short
passage
between
the
women
:
``
You
'd
better
leave
the
message
with
a
waiter
,
''
Nicole
's
voice
was
stern
and
unmodulated
,
``
we
're
leaving
immediately
.
''
Rosemary
got
it
,
took
it
without
resentment
.
``
I
'll
let
it
go
then
.
Good-by
,
you
darlings
.
''
Dick
asked
for
the
check
;
the
Divers
relaxed
,
chewing
tentatively
on
toothpicks
.
``
Well
--
''
they
said
together
.
He
saw
a
flash
of
unhappiness
on
her
mouth
,
so
brief
that
only
he
would
have
noticed
,
and
he
could
pretend
not
to
have
seen
.
What
did
Nicole
think
?
Rosemary
was
one
of
a
dozen
people
he
had
``
worked
over
''
in
the
past
years
:
these
had
included
a
French
circus
clown
,
Abe
and
Mary
North
,
a
pair
of
dancers
,
a
writer
,
a
painter
,
a
comedienne
from
the
Grand
Guignol
,
a
half-crazy
pederast
from
the
Russian
Ballet
,
a
promising
tenor
they
had
staked
to
a
year
in
Milan
.
Nicole
well
knew
how
seriously
these
people
interpreted
his
interest
and
enthusiasm
;
but
she
realized
also
that
,
except
while
their
children
were
being
born
,
Dick
had
not
spent
a
night
apart
from
her
since
their
marriage
.
On
the
other
hand
,
there
was
a
pleasingness
about
him
that
simply
had
to
be
used
--
those
who
possessed
that
pleasingness
had
to
keep
their
hands
in
,
and
go
along
attaching
people
that
they
had
no
use
to
make
of
.
Now
Dick
hardened
himself
and
let
minutes
pass
without
making
any
gesture
of
confidence
,
any
representation
of
constantly
renewed
surprise
that
they
were
one
together
.
Collis
Clay
out
of
the
South
edged
a
passage
between
the
closely
packed
tables
and
greeted
the
Divers
cavalierly
.
Such
salutations
always
astonished
Dick
--
acquaintances
saying
``
Hi
!
''
to
them
,
or
speaking
only
to
one
of
them
.
He
felt
so
intensely
about
people
that
in
moments
of
apathy
he
preferred
to
remain
concealed
;
that
one
could
parade
a
casualness
into
his
presence
was
a
challenge
to
the
key
on
which
he
lived
.
Collis
,
unaware
that
he
was
without
a
wedding
garment
,
heralded
his
arrival
with
:
``
I
reckon
I
'm
late
--
the
beyed
has
flown
.
''
Dick
had
to
wrench
something
out
of
himself
before
he
could
forgive
him
for
not
having
first
complimented
Nicole
.
She
left
almost
immediately
and
he
sat
with
Collis
,
finishing
the
last
of
his
wine
.
He
rather
liked
Collis
--
he
was
``
post-war
''
;
less
difficult
than
most
of
the
Southerners
he
had
known
at
New
Haven
a
decade
previously
.
Dick
listened
with
amusement
to
the
conversation
that
accompanied
the
slow
,
profound
stuffing
of
a
pipe
.
In
the
early
afternoon
children
and
nurses
were
trekking
into
the
Luxembourg
Gardens
;
it
was
the
first
time
in
months
that
Dick
had
let
this
part
of
the
day
out
of
his
hands
.
Suddenly
his
blood
ran
cold
as
he
realized
the
content
of
Collis
's
confidential
monologue.
``
--
she
's
not
so
cold
as
you
'd
probably
think
.
I
admit
I
thought
she
was
cold
for
a
long
time
.
But
she
got
into
a
jam
with
a
friend
of
mine
going
from
New
York
to
Chicago
at
Easter
--
a
boy
named
Hillis
she
thought
was
pretty
nutsey
at
New
Haven
--
she
had
a
compartment
with
a
cousin
of
mine
but
she
and
Hillis
wanted
to
be
alone
,
so
in
the
afternoon
my
cousin
came
and
played
cards
in
our
compartment
.
Well
,
after
about
two
hours
we
went
back
and
there
was
Rosemary
and
Bill
Hillis
standing
in
the
vestibule
arguing
with
the
conductor
--
Rosemary
white
as
a
sheet
.
Seems
they
locked
the
door
and
pulled
down
the
blinds
and
I
guess
there
was
some
heavy
stuff
going
on
when
the
conductor
came
for
the
tickets
and
knocked
on
the
door
.
They
thought
it
was
us
kidding
them
and
would
n't
let
him
in
at
first
,
and
when
they
did
,
he
was
plenty
sore
.
He
asked
Hillis
if
that
was
his
compartment
and
whether
he
and
Rosemary
were
married
that
they
locked
the
door
,
and
Hillis
lost
his
temper
trying
to
explain
there
was
nothing
wrong
.
He
said
the
conductor
had
insulted
Rosemary
and
he
wanted
him
to
fight
,
but
that
conductor
could
have
made
trouble
--
and
believe
me
I
had
an
awful
time
smoothing
it
over
.
''
With
every
detail
imagined
,
with
even
envy
for
the
pair
's
community
of
misfortune
in
the
vestibule
,
Dick
felt
a
change
taking
place
within
him
.
Only
the
image
of
a
third
person
,
even
a
vanished
one
,
entering
into
his
relation
with
Rosemary
was
needed
to
throw
him
off
his
balance
and
send
through
him
waves
of
pain
,
misery
,
desire
,
desperation
.
The
vividly
pictured
hand
on
Rosemary
's
cheek
,
the
quicker
breath
,
the
white
excitement
of
the
event
viewed
from
outside
,
the
inviolable
secret
warmth
within
.
--
Do
you
mind
if
I
pull
down
the
curtain
?
--
Please
do
.
It
's
too
light
in
here
.
Collis
Clay
was
now
speaking
about
fraternity
politics
at
New
Haven
,
in
the
same
tone
,
with
the
same
emphasis
.
Dick
had
gathered
that
he
was
in
love
with
Rosemary
in
some
curious
way
Dick
could
not
have
understood
.
The
affair
with
Hillis
seemed
to
have
made
no
emotional
impression
on
Collis
save
to
give
him
the
joyful
conviction
that
Rosemary
was
``
human
.
''
``
Bones
got
a
wonderful
crowd
,
''
he
said
.
``
We
all
did
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
.
New
Haven
's
so
big
now
the
sad
thing
is
the
men
we
have
to
leave
out
.
''
--
Do
you
mind
if
I
pull
down
the
curtain
?
--
Please
do
.
It
's
too
light
in
here
.
.
.
.
Dick
went
over
Paris
to
his
bank
--
writing
a
check
,
he
looked
along
the
row
of
men
at
the
desks
deciding
to
which
one
he
would
present
it
for
an
O.K
.
As
he
wrote
he
engrossed
himself
in
the
material
act
,
examining
meticulously
the
pen
,
writing
laboriously
upon
the
high
glass-topped
desk
.
Once
he
raised
glazed
eyes
to
look
toward
the
mail
department
,
then
glazed
his
spirit
again
by
concentration
upon
the
objects
he
dealt
with
.
Still
he
failed
to
decide
to
whom
the
check
should
be
presented
,
which
man
in
the
line
would
guess
least
of
the
unhappy
predicament
in
which
he
found
himself
and
,
also
,
which
one
would
be
least
likely
to
talk
.
There
was
Perrin
,
the
suave
New
Yorker
,
who
had
asked
him
to
luncheons
at
the
American
Club
,
there
was
Casasus
,
the
Spaniard
,
with
whom
he
usually
discussed
a
mutual
friend
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
friend
had
passed
out
of
his
life
a
dozen
years
before
;
there
was
Muchhause
,
who
always
asked
him
whether
he
wanted
to
draw
upon
his
wife
's
money
or
his
own
.
As
he
entered
the
amount
on
the
stub
,
and
drew
two
lines
under
it
,
he
decided
to
go
to
Pierce
,
who
was
young
and
for
whom
he
would
have
to
put
on
only
a
small
show
.
It
was
often
easier
to
give
a
show
than
to
watch
one
.
He
went
to
the
mail
desk
first
--
as
the
woman
who
served
him
pushed
up
with
her
bosom
a
piece
of
paper
that
had
nearly
escaped
the
desk
,
he
thought
how
differently
women
use
their
bodies
from
men
.
He
took
his
letters
aside
to
open
:
There
was
a
bill
for
seventeen
psychiatric
books
from
a
German
concern
,
a
bill
from
Brentano
's
,
a
letter
from
Buffalo
from
his
father
,
in
a
handwriting
that
year
by
year
became
more
indecipherable
;
there
was
a
card
from
Tommy
Barban
postmarked
Fez
and
bearing
a
facetious
communication
;
there
were
letters
from
doctors
in
Zurich
,
both
in
German
;
a
disputed
bill
from
a
plasterer
in
Cannes
;
a
bill
from
a
furniture
maker
;
a
letter
from
the
publisher
of
a
medical
journal
in
Baltimore
,
miscellaneous
announcements
and
an
invitation
to
a
showing
of
pictures
by
an
incipient
artist
;
also
there
were
three
letters
for
Nicole
,
and
a
letter
for
Rosemary
sent
in
his
care
.
--
Do
you
mind
if
I
pull
down
the
curtain
?
He
went
toward
Pierce
but
he
was
engaged
with
a
woman
,
and
Dick
saw
with
his
heels
that
he
would
have
to
present
his
check
to
Casasus
at
the
next
desk
,
who
was
free
.
``
How
are
you
,
Diver
?
''
Casasus
was
genial
.
He
stood
up
,
his
mustache
spreading
with
his
smile
.
``
We
were
talking
about
Featherstone
the
other
day
and
I
thought
of
you
--
he
's
out
in
California
now
.
''
Dick
widened
his
eyes
and
bent
forward
a
little
.
``
In
California
?
''
``
That
's
what
I
heard
.
''
Dick
held
the
check
poised
;
to
focus
the
attention
of
Casasus
upon
it
he
looked
toward
Pierce
's
desk
,
holding
the
latter
for
a
moment
in
a
friendly
eye-play
conditioned
by
an
old
joke
of
three
years
before
when
Pierce
had
been
involved
with
a
Lithuanian
countess
.
Pierce
played
up
with
a
grin
until
Casasus
had
authorized
the
check
and
had
no
further
recourse
to
detain
Dick
,
whom
he
liked
,
than
to
stand
up
holding
his
pince-nez
and
repeat
,
``
Yes
,
he
's
in
California
.
''
Meanwhile
Dick
had
seen
that
Perrin
,
at
the
head
of
the
line
of
desks
,
was
in
conversation
with
the
heavyweight
champion
of
the
world
;
from
a
sidesweep
of
Perrin
's
eye
Dick
saw
that
he
was
considering
calling
him
over
and
introducing
him
,
but
that
he
finally
decided
against
it
.
Cutting
across
the
social
mood
of
Casasus
with
the
intensity
he
had
accumulated
at
the
glass
desk
--
which
is
to
say
he
looked
hard
at
the
check
,
studying
it
,
and
then
fixed
his
eyes
on
grave
problems
beyond
the
first
marble
pillar
to
the
right
of
the
banker
's
head
and
made
a
business
of
shifting
the
cane
,
hat
,
and
letters
he
carried
--
he
said
good-by
and
went
out
.
He
had
long
ago
purchased
the
doorman
;
his
taxi
sprang
to
the
curb
.
``
I
want
to
go
to
the
Films
Par
Excellence
Studio
--
it
's
on
a
little
street
in
Passy
.
Go
to
the
Muette
.
I
'll
direct
you
from
there
.
''
He
was
rendered
so
uncertain
by
the
events
of
the
last
forty-eight
hours
that
he
was
not
even
sure
of
what
he
wanted
to
do
;
he
paid
off
the
taxi
at
the
Muette
and
walked
in
the
direction
of
the
studio
,
crossing
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
before
he
came
to
the
building
.
Dignified
in
his
fine
clothes
,
with
their
fine
accessories
,
he
was
yet
swayed
and
driven
as
an
animal
.
Dignity
could
come
only
with
an
overthrowing
of
his
past
,
of
the
effort
of
the
last
six
years
.
He
went
briskly
around
the
block
with
the
fatuousness
of
one
of
Tarkington
's
adolescents
,
hurrying
at
the
blind
places
lest
he
miss
Rosemary
's
coming
out
of
the
studio
.
It
was
a
melancholy
neighborhood
.
Next
door
to
the
place
he
saw
a
sign
:
``
1000
chemises
.
''
The
shirts
filled
the
window
,
piled
,
cravated
,
stuffed
,
or
draped
with
shoddy
grace
on
the
showcase
floor
:
``
1000
chemises
''
--
count
them
!
On
either
side
he
read
:
``
Papeterie
,
''
``
Pâtisserie
,
''
``
Solde
,
''
``
Réclame
''
--
and
Constance
Talmadge
in
``
Déjeuner
de
Soleil
,
''
and
farther
away
there
were
more
sombre
announcements
:
``
Vêtements
Ecclésiastiques
,
''
``
Déclaration
de
Décès
''
and
``
Pompes
Funèbres
.
''
Life
and
death
.
He
knew
that
what
he
was
now
doing
marked
a
turning
point
in
his
life
--
it
was
out
of
line
with
everything
that
had
preceded
it
--
even
out
of
line
with
what
effect
he
might
hope
to
produce
upon
Rosemary
.
Rosemary
saw
him
always
as
a
model
of
correctness
--
his
presence
walking
around
this
block
was
an
intrusion
.
But
Dick
's
necessity
of
behaving
as
he
did
was
a
projection
of
some
submerged
reality
:
he
was
compelled
to
walk
there
,
or
stand
there
,
his
shirt-sleeve
fitting
his
wrist
and
his
coat
sleeve
encasing
his
shirt-sleeve
like
a
sleeve
valve
,
his
collar
molded
plastically
to
his
neck
,
his
red
hair
cut
exactly
,
his
hand
holding
his
small
briefcase
like
a
dandy
--
just
as
another
man
once
found
it
necessary
to
stand
in
front
of
a
church
in
Ferrara
,
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
.
Dick
was
paying
some
tribute
to
things
unforgotten
,
unshriven
,
unexpurgated
.
XXI
After
three-quarters
of
an
hour
of
standing
around
,
he
became
suddenly
involved
in
a
human
contact
.
It
was
just
the
sort
of
thing
that
was
likely
to
happen
to
him
when
he
was
in
the
mood
of
not
wanting
to
see
any
one
.
So
rigidly
did
he
sometimes
guard
his
exposed
self-consciousness
that
frequently
he
defeated
his
own
purposes
;
as
an
actor
who
underplays
a
part
sets
up
a
craning
forward
,
a
stimulated
emotional
attention
in
an
audience
,
and
seems
to
create
in
others
an
ability
to
bridge
the
gap
he
has
left
open
.
Similarly
we
are
seldom
sorry
for
those
who
need
and
crave
our
pity
--
we
reserve
this
for
those
who
,
by
other
means
,
make
us
exercise
the
abstract
function
of
pity
.
So
Dick
might
,
himself
,
have
analyzed
the
incident
that
ensued
.
As
he
paced
the
Rue
des
Saintes-Anges
he
was
spoken
to
by
a
thin-faced
American
,
perhaps
thirty
,
with
an
air
of
being
scarred
and
a
slight
but
sinister
smile
.
As
Dick
gave
him
the
light
he
requested
,
he
placed
him
as
one
of
a
type
of
which
he
had
been
conscious
since
early
youth
--
a
type
that
loafed
about
tobacco
stores
with
one
elbow
on
the
counter
and
watched
,
through
heaven
knew
what
small
chink
of
the
mind
,
the
people
who
came
in
and
out
.
Intimate
to
garages
,
where
he
had
vague
business
conducted
in
undertones
,
to
barber
shops
,
to
the
lobbies
of
theatres
--
in
such
places
,
at
any
rate
,
Dick
placed
him
.
Sometimes
the
face
bobbed
up
in
one
of
Tad
's
more
savage
cartoons
--
in
boyhood
Dick
had
often
thrown
an
uneasy
glance
at
the
dim
borderland
of
crime
on
which
he
stood
.
``
How
do
you
like
Paris
,
Buddy
?
''
Not
waiting
for
an
answer
the
man
tried
to
fit
in
his
footsteps
with
Dick
's
:
``
Where
you
from
?
''
he
asked
encouragingly
.
``
From
Buffalo
.
''
``
I
'm
from
San
Antone
--
but
I
been
over
here
since
the
war
.
''
``
You
in
the
army
?
''
``
I
'll
say
I
was
.
Eighty-fourth
Division
--
ever
heard
of
that
outfit
?
''
The
man
walked
a
little
ahead
of
him
and
fixed
him
with
eyes
that
were
practically
menacing
.
``
Staying
in
Paris
awhile
,
Buddy
?
Or
just
passing
through
.
''
``
Passing
through
.
''
``
What
hotel
you
staying
at
?
''
Dick
had
begun
laughing
to
himself
--
the
party
had
the
intention
of
rifling
his
room
that
night
.
His
thoughts
were
read
apparently
without
self-consciousness
.
``
With
a
build
like
yours
you
ought
n't
to
be
afraid
of
me
,
Buddy
.
There
's
a
lot
of
bums
around
just
laying
for
American
tourists
,
but
you
need
n't
be
afraid
of
me
.
''
Becoming
bored
,
Dick
stopped
walking
:
``
I
just
wonder
why
you
've
got
so
much
time
to
waste
.
''
``
I
'm
in
business
here
in
Paris
.
''
``
In
what
line
?
''
``
Selling
papers
.
''
The
contrast
between
the
formidable
manner
and
the
mild
profession
was
absurd
--
but
the
man
amended
it
with
:
``
Do
n't
worry
;
I
made
plenty
money
last
year
--
ten
or
twenty
francs
for
a
Sunny
Times
that
cost
six
.
''
He
produced
a
newspaper
clipping
from
a
rusty
wallet
and
passed
it
over
to
one
who
had
become
a
fellow
stroller
--
the
cartoon
showed
a
stream
of
Americans
pouring
from
the
gangplank
of
a
liner
freighted
with
gold
.
``
Two
hundred
thousand
--
spending
ten
million
a
summer
.
''
``
What
you
doing
out
here
in
Passy
?
''
His
companion
looked
around
cautiously
.
``
Movies
,
''
he
said
darkly
.
``
They
got
an
American
studio
over
there
.
And
they
need
guys
can
speak
English
.
I
'm
waiting
for
a
break
.
''
Dick
shook
him
off
quickly
and
firmly
.
It
had
become
apparent
that
Rosemary
either
had
escaped
on
one
of
his
early
circuits
of
the
block
or
else
had
left
before
he
came
into
the
neighborhood
;
he
went
into
the
bistro
on
the
corner
,
bought
a
lead
disk
and
,
squeezed
in
an
alcove
between
the
kitchen
and
the
foul
toilet
,
he
called
the
Roi
George
.
He
recognized
Cheyne-Stokes
tendencies
in
his
respiration
--
but
like
everything
the
symptom
served
only
to
turn
him
in
toward
his
emotion
.
He
gave
the
number
of
the
hotel
;
then
stood
holding
the
phone
and
staring
into
the
café
;
after
a
long
while
a
strange
little
voice
said
hello
.
``
This
is
Dick
--
I
had
to
call
you
.
''
A
pause
from
her
--
then
bravely
,
and
in
key
with
his
emotion
:
``
I
'm
glad
you
did
.
''
``
I
came
to
meet
you
at
your
studio
--
I
'm
out
in
Passy
across
the
way
from
it
.
I
thought
maybe
we
'd
ride
around
through
the
Bois
.
''
``
Oh
,
I
only
stayed
there
a
minute
!
I
'm
so
sorry
.
''
A
silence
.
``
Rosemary
.
''
``
Yes
,
Dick
.
''
``
Look
,
I
'm
in
an
extraordinary
condition
about
you
.
When
a
child
can
disturb
a
middle-aged
gent
--
things
get
difficult
.
''
``
You
're
not
middle-aged
,
Dick
--
you
're
the
youngest
person
in
the
world
.
''
``
Rosemary
?
''
Silence
while
he
stared
at
a
shelf
that
held
the
humbler
poisons
of
France
--
bottles
of
Otard
,
Rhum
St.
James
,
Marie
Brizzard
,
Punch
Orangeade
,
André
Fernet
Blanco
,
Cherry
Rochet
,
and
Armagnac
.
``
Are
you
alone
?
''
--
Do
you
mind
if
I
pull
down
the
curtain
?
``
Who
do
you
think
I
'd
be
with
?
''
``
That
's
the
state
I
'm
in
.
I
'd
like
to
be
with
you
now
.
''
Silence
,
then
a
sigh
and
an
answer
.
``
I
wish
you
were
with
me
now
.
''
There
was
the
hotel
room
where
she
lay
behind
a
telephone
number
,
and
little
gusts
of
music
wailed
around
her
--
``
And
two
--
for
tea
.
And
me
for
you
,
And
you
for
me
Alow-own
.
''
There
was
the
remembered
dust
of
powder
over
her
tan
--
when
he
kissed
her
face
it
was
damp
around
the
corners
of
her
hair
;
there
was
the
flash
of
a
white
face
under
his
own
,
the
arc
of
a
shoulder
.
``
It
's
impossible
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
In
a
minute
he
was
out
in
the
street
marching
along
toward
the
Muette
,
or
away
from
it
,
his
small
brief-case
still
in
his
hand
,
his
gold-headed
stick
held
at
a
sword-like
angle
.
Rosemary
returned
to
her
desk
and
finished
a
letter
to
her
mother.
``
--
I
only
saw
him
for
a
little
while
but
I
thought
he
was
wonderful
looking
.
I
fell
in
love
with
him
(
Of
course
I
Do
Love
Dick
Best
but
you
know
what
I
mean
)
.
He
really
is
going
to
direct
the
picture
and
is
leaving
immediately
for
Hollywood
,
and
I
think
we
ought
to
leave
,
too
.
Collis
Clay
has
been
here
.
I
like
him
all
right
but
have
not
seen
much
of
him
because
of
the
Divers
,
who
really
are
divine
,
about
the
Nicest
People
I
ever
Knew
.
I
am
feeling
not
very
well
to-day
and
am
taking
the
Medicine
,
though
see
No
need
for
it
.
I
'm
not
even
Going
to
Try
to
tell
you
All
that
's
Happened
until
I
see
You
!
!
!
So
when
you
get
this
letter
wire
,
wire
,
wire
!
Are
you
coming
north
or
shall
I
come
south
with
the
Divers
?
''
At
six
Dick
called
Nicole
.
``
Have
you
any
special
plans
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Would
you
like
to
do
something
quiet
--
dinner
at
the
hotel
and
then
a
play
?
''
``
Would
you
?
I
'll
do
whatever
you
want
.
I
phoned
Rosemary
a
while
ago
and
she
's
having
dinner
in
her
room
.
I
think
this
upset
all
of
us
,
do
n't
you
?
''
``
It
did
n't
upset
me
,
''
he
objected
.
``
Darling
,
unless
you
're
physically
tired
let
's
do
something
.
Otherwise
we
'll
get
south
and
spend
a
week
wondering
why
we
did
n't
see
Boucher
.
It
's
better
than
brooding
--
''
This
was
a
blunder
and
Nicole
took
him
up
sharply
.
``
Brooding
about
what
?
''
``
About
Maria
Wallis
.
''
She
agreed
to
go
to
a
play
.
It
was
a
tradition
between
them
that
they
should
never
be
too
tired
for
anything
,
and
they
found
it
made
the
days
better
on
the
whole
and
put
the
evenings
more
in
order
.
When
,
inevitably
,
their
spirits
flagged
they
shifted
the
blame
to
the
weariness
and
fatigue
of
others
.
Before
they
went
out
,
as
fine-looking
a
couple
as
could
be
found
in
Paris
,
they
knocked
softly
at
Rosemary
's
door
.
There
was
no
answer
;
judging
that
she
was
asleep
they
walked
into
a
warm
strident
Paris
night
,
snatching
a
vermouth
and
bitters
in
the
shadow
by
Fouquet
's
bar
.
XXII
Nicole
awoke
late
,
murmuring
something
back
into
her
dream
before
she
parted
her
long
lashes
tangled
with
sleep
.
Dick
's
bed
was
empty
--
only
after
a
minute
did
she
realize
that
she
had
been
awakened
by
a
knock
at
their
salon
door
.
``
Entrez
!
''
she
called
,
but
there
was
no
answer
,
and
after
a
moment
she
slipped
on
a
dressing-gown
and
went
to
open
it
.
A
sergent-de-ville
confronted
her
courteously
and
stepped
inside
the
door
.
``
Mr.
Afghan
North
--
he
is
here
?
''
``
What
?
No
--
he
's
gone
to
America
.
''
``
When
did
he
leave
,
Madame
?
''
``
Yesterday
morning
.
''
He
shook
his
head
and
waved
his
forefinger
at
her
in
a
quicker
rhythm
.
``
He
was
in
Paris
last
night
.
He
is
registered
here
but
his
room
is
not
occupied
.
They
told
me
I
had
better
ask
at
this
room
.
''
``
Sounds
very
peculiar
to
me
--
we
saw
him
off
yesterday
morning
on
the
boat
train
.
''
``
Be
that
as
it
may
,
he
has
been
seen
here
this
morning
.
Even
his
carte
d'identité
has
been
seen
.
And
there
you
are
.
''
``
We
know
nothing
about
it
,
''
she
proclaimed
in
amazement
.
He
considered
.
He
was
an
ill-smelling
,
handsome
man
.
``
You
were
not
with
him
at
all
last
night
?
''
``
But
no
.
''
``
We
have
arrested
a
Negro
.
We
are
convinced
we
have
at
last
arrested
the
correct
Negro
.
''
``
I
assure
you
that
I
have
n't
an
idea
what
you
're
talking
about
.
If
it
's
the
Mr.
Abraham
North
,
the
one
we
know
,
well
,
if
he
was
in
Paris
last
night
we
were
n't
aware
of
it
.
''
The
man
nodded
,
sucked
his
upper
lip
,
convinced
but
disappointed
.
``
What
happened
?
''
Nicole
demanded
.
He
showed
his
palms
,
puffing
out
his
closed
mouth
.
He
had
begun
to
find
her
attractive
and
his
eyes
flickered
at
her
.
``
What
do
you
wish
,
Madame
?
A
summer
affair
.
Mr.
Afghan
North
was
robbed
and
he
made
a
complaint
.
We
have
arrested
the
miscreant
.
Mr.
Afghan
should
come
to
identify
him
and
make
the
proper
charges
.
''
Nicole
pulled
her
dressing-gown
closer
around
her
and
dismissed
him
briskly
.
Mystified
she
took
a
bath
and
dressed
.
By
this
time
it
was
after
ten
and
she
called
Rosemary
but
got
no
answer
--
then
she
phoned
the
hotel
office
and
found
that
Abe
had
indeed
registered
,
at
six-thirty
this
morning
.
His
room
,
however
,
was
still
unoccupied
.
Hoping
for
a
word
from
Dick
she
waited
in
the
parlor
of
the
suite
;
just
as
she
had
given
up
and
decided
to
go
out
,
the
office
called
and
announced
:
``
Meestaire
Crawshow
,
un
nègre
.
''
``
On
what
business
?
''
she
demanded
.
``
He
says
he
knows
you
and
the
doctaire
.
He
says
there
is
a
Meestaire
Freeman
into
prison
that
is
a
friend
of
all
the
world
.
He
says
there
is
injustice
and
he
wishes
to
see
Meestaire
North
before
he
himself
is
arrested
.
''
``
We
know
nothing
about
it
.
''
Nicole
disclaimed
the
whole
business
with
a
vehement
clap
of
the
receiver
.
Abe
's
bizarre
reappearance
made
it
plain
to
her
how
fatigued
she
was
with
his
dissipation
.
Dismissing
him
from
her
mind
she
went
out
,
ran
into
Rosemary
at
the
dressmaker
's
,
and
shopped
with
her
for
artificial
flowers
and
all-colored
strings
of
colored
beads
on
the
Rue
de
Rivoli
.
She
helped
Rosemary
choose
a
diamond
for
her
mother
,
and
some
scarfs
and
novel
cigarette
cases
to
take
home
to
business
associates
in
California
.
For
her
son
she
bought
Greek
and
Roman
soldiers
,
a
whole
army
of
them
,
costing
over
a
thousand
francs
.
Once
again
they
spent
their
money
in
different
ways
and
again
Rosemary
admired
Nicole
's
method
of
spending
.
Nicole
was
sure
that
the
money
she
spent
was
hers
--
Rosemary
still
thought
her
money
was
miraculously
lent
to
her
and
she
must
consequently
be
very
careful
of
it
.
It
was
fun
spending
money
in
the
sunlight
of
the
foreign
city
with
healthy
bodies
under
them
that
sent
streams
of
color
up
to
their
faces
;
with
arms
and
hands
,
legs
and
ankles
that
they
stretched
out
confidently
,
reaching
or
stepping
with
the
confidence
of
women
lovely
to
men
.
When
they
got
back
to
the
hotel
and
found
Dick
,
all
bright
and
new
in
the
morning
,
both
of
them
had
a
moment
of
complete
childish
joy
.
He
had
just
received
a
garbled
telephone
call
from
Abe
who
,
so
it
appeared
,
had
spent
the
forenoon
in
hiding
.
``
It
was
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
telephone
conversations
I
've
ever
held
.
''
Dick
had
talked
not
only
to
Abe
but
to
a
dozen
others
.
On
the
phone
these
supernumeraries
had
been
typically
introduced
as
:
``
--
man
wants
to
talk
to
you
is
in
the
teput
dome
,
well
he
says
he
was
in
it
--
what
is
it
?
``
Hey
,
somebody
,
shut-up
--
anyhow
,
he
was
in
some
shandel-scandal
and
he
kaa
possibly
go
home
.
My
own
personal
is
that
--
my
personal
is
he
's
had
a
--
''
Gulps
sounded
and
thereafter
what
the
party
had
,
rested
with
the
unknown
.
The
phone
yielded
up
a
supplementary
offer
:
``
I
thought
it
would
appeal
to
you
anyhow
as
a
psychologist
.
''
The
vague
personality
who
corresponded
to
this
statement
was
eventually
hung
on
to
the
phone
;
in
the
sequence
he
failed
to
appeal
to
Dick
,
as
a
psychologist
,
or
indeed
as
anything
else
.
Abe
's
conversation
flowed
on
as
follows
:
``
Hello
.
''
``
Well
?
''
``
Well
,
hello
.
''
``
Who
are
you
?
''
``
Well
.
''
There
were
interpolated
snorts
of
laughter
.
``
Well
,
I
'll
put
somebody
else
on
the
line
.
''
Sometimes
Dick
could
hear
Abe
's
voice
,
accompanied
by
scufflings
,
droppings
of
the
receiver
,
far-away
fragments
such
as
,
``
No
,
I
do
n't
,
Mr.
North
.
.
.
.
''
Then
a
pert
decided
voice
had
said
:
``
If
you
are
a
friend
of
Mr.
North
you
will
come
down
and
take
him
away
.
''
Abe
cut
in
,
solemn
and
ponderous
,
beating
it
all
down
with
an
overtone
of
earth-bound
determination
.
``
Dick
,
I
've
launched
a
race
riot
in
Montmartre
.
I
'm
going
over
and
get
Freeman
out
of
jail
.
If
a
Negro
from
Copenhagen
that
makes
shoe
polish
--
hello
,
can
you
hear
me
--
well
,
look
,
if
anybody
comes
there
--
''
Once
again
the
receiver
was
a
chorus
of
innumerable
melodies
.
``
Why
you
back
in
Paris
?
''
Dick
demanded
.
``
I
got
as
far
as
Evreux
,
and
I
decided
to
take
a
plane
back
so
I
could
compare
it
with
St.
Sulpice
.
I
mean
I
do
n't
intend
to
bring
St.
Sulpice
back
to
Paris
.
I
do
n't
even
mean
Baroque
!
I
meant
St.
Germain
.
For
God
's
sake
,
wait
a
minute
and
I
'll
put
the
chasseur
on
the
wire
.
''
``
For
God
's
sake
,
do
n't
.
''
``
Listen
--
did
Mary
get
off
all
right
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
``
Dick
,
I
want
you
to
talk
with
a
man
I
met
here
this
morning
,
the
son
of
a
naval
officer
that
's
been
to
every
doctor
in
Europe
.
Let
me
tell
you
about
him
--
''
Dick
had
rung
off
at
this
point
--
perhaps
that
was
a
piece
of
ingratitude
for
he
needed
grist
for
the
grinding
activity
of
his
mind
.
``
Abe
used
to
be
so
nice
,
''
Nicole
told
Rosemary
.
``
So
nice
.
Long
ago
--
when
Dick
and
I
were
first
married
.
If
you
had
known
him
then
.
He
'd
come
to
stay
with
us
for
weeks
and
weeks
and
we
scarcely
knew
he
was
in
the
house
.
Sometimes
he
'd
play
--
sometimes
he
'd
be
in
the
library
with
a
muted
piano
,
making
love
to
it
by
the
hour
--
Dick
,
do
you
remember
that
maid
?
She
thought
he
was
a
ghost
and
sometimes
Abe
used
to
meet
her
in
the
hall
and
moo
at
her
,
and
it
cost
us
a
whole
tea
service
once
--
but
we
did
n't
care
.
''
So
much
fun
--
so
long
ago
.
Rosemary
envied
them
their
fun
,
imagining
a
life
of
leisure
unlike
her
own
.
She
knew
little
of
leisure
but
she
had
the
respect
for
it
of
those
who
have
never
had
it
.
She
thought
of
it
as
a
resting
,
without
realizing
that
the
Divers
were
as
far
from
relaxing
as
she
was
herself
.
``
What
did
this
to
him
?
''
she
asked
.
``
Why
does
he
have
to
drink
?
''
Nicole
shook
her
head
right
and
left
,
disclaiming
responsibility
for
the
matter
:
``
So
many
smart
men
go
to
pieces
nowadays
.
''
``
And
when
have
n't
they
?
''
Dick
asked
.
``
Smart
men
play
close
to
the
line
because
they
have
to
--
some
of
them
ca
n't
stand
it
,
so
they
quit
.
''
``
It
must
lie
deeper
than
that
.
''
Nicole
clung
to
her
conversation
;
also
she
was
irritated
that
Dick
should
contradict
her
before
Rosemary
.
``
Artists
like
--
well
,
like
Fernand
do
n't
seem
to
have
to
wallow
in
alcohol
.
Why
is
it
just
Americans
who
dissipate
?
''
There
were
so
many
answers
to
this
question
that
Dick
decided
to
leave
it
in
the
air
,
to
buzz
victoriously
in
Nicole
's
ears
.
He
had
become
intensely
critical
of
her
.
Though
he
thought
she
was
the
most
attractive
human
creature
he
had
ever
seen
,
though
he
got
from
her
everything
he
needed
,
he
scented
battle
from
afar
,
and
subconsciously
he
had
been
hardening
and
arming
himself
,
hour
by
hour
.
He
was
not
given
to
self-indulgence
and
he
felt
comparatively
graceless
at
this
moment
of
indulging
himself
,
blinding
his
eyes
with
the
hope
that
Nicole
guessed
at
only
an
emotional
excitement
about
Rosemary
.
He
was
not
sure
--
last
night
at
the
theatre
she
had
referred
pointedly
to
Rosemary
as
a
child
.
The
trio
lunched
downstairs
in
an
atmosphere
of
carpets
and
padded
waiters
,
who
did
not
march
at
the
stomping
quick-step
of
those
men
who
brought
good
food
to
the
tables
whereon
they
had
recently
dined
.
Here
there
were
families
of
Americans
staring
around
at
families
of
Americans
,
and
trying
to
make
conversation
with
one
another
.
There
was
a
party
at
the
next
table
that
they
could
not
account
for
.
It
consisted
of
an
expansive
,
somewhat
secretarial
,
would-you-mind-repeating
young
man
,
and
a
score
of
women
.
The
women
were
neither
young
nor
old
nor
of
any
particular
social
class
;
yet
the
party
gave
the
impression
of
a
unit
,
held
more
closely
together
for
example
than
a
group
of
wives
stalling
through
a
professional
congress
of
their
husbands
.
Certainly
it
was
more
of
a
unit
than
any
conceivable
tourist
party
.
An
instinct
made
Dick
suck
back
the
grave
derision
that
formed
on
his
tongue
;
he
asked
the
waiter
to
find
out
who
they
were
.
``
Those
are
the
gold-star
muzzers
,
''
explained
the
waiter
.
Aloud
and
in
low
voices
they
exclaimed
.
Rosemary
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
``
Probably
the
young
ones
are
the
wives
,
''
said
Nicole
.
Over
his
wine
Dick
looked
at
them
again
;
in
their
happy
faces
,
the
dignity
that
surrounded
and
pervaded
the
party
,
he
perceived
all
the
maturity
of
an
older
America
.
For
a
while
the
sobered
women
who
had
come
to
mourn
for
their
dead
,
for
something
they
could
not
repair
,
made
the
room
beautiful
.
Momentarily
,
he
sat
again
on
his
father
's
knee
,
riding
with
Moseby
while
the
old
loyalties
and
devotions
fought
on
around
him
.
Almost
with
an
effort
he
turned
back
to
his
two
women
at
the
table
and
faced
the
whole
new
world
in
which
he
believed
.
--
Do
you
mind
if
I
pull
down
the
curtain
?
XXIII
Abe
North
was
still
in
the
Ritz
bar
,
where
he
had
been
since
nine
in
the
morning
.
When
he
arrived
seeking
sanctuary
the
windows
were
open
and
great
beams
were
busy
at
pulling
up
the
dust
from
smoky
carpets
and
cushions
.
Chasseurs
tore
through
the
corridors
,
liberated
and
disembodied
,
moving
for
the
moment
in
pure
space
.
The
sit-down
bar
for
women
,
across
from
the
bar
proper
,
seemed
very
small
--
it
was
hard
to
imagine
what
throngs
it
could
accommodate
in
the
afternoon
.
The
famous
Paul
,
the
concessionaire
,
had
not
arrived
,
but
Claude
,
who
was
checking
stock
,
broke
off
his
work
with
no
improper
surprise
to
make
Abe
a
pick-me-up
.
Abe
sat
on
a
bench
against
a
wall
.
After
two
drinks
he
began
to
feel
better
--
so
much
better
that
he
mounted
to
the
barber
's
shop
and
was
shaved
.
When
he
returned
to
the
bar
Paul
had
arrived
--
in
his
custom-built
motor
,
from
which
he
had
disembarked
correctly
at
the
Boulevard
des
Capucines
.
Paul
liked
Abe
and
came
over
to
talk
.
``
I
was
supposed
to
ship
home
this
morning
,
''
Abe
said
.
``
I
mean
yesterday
morning
,
or
whatever
this
is
.
''
``
Why
din
you
?
''
asked
Paul
.
Abe
considered
,
and
happened
finally
to
a
reason
:
``
I
was
reading
a
serial
in
Liberty
and
the
next
installment
was
due
here
in
Paris
--
so
if
I
'd
sailed
I
'd
have
missed
it
--
then
I
never
would
have
read
it
.
''
``
It
must
be
a
very
good
story
.
''
``
It
's
a
terr-r-rible
story
.
''
Paul
arose
chuckling
and
paused
,
leaning
on
the
back
of
a
chair
:
``
If
you
really
want
to
get
off
,
Mr.
North
,
there
are
friends
of
yours
going
to-morrow
on
the
France
--
Mister
what
is
this
name
--
and
Slim
Pearson
.
Mister
--
I
'll
think
of
it
--
tall
with
a
new
beard
.
''
``
Yardly
,
''
Abe
supplied
.
``
Mr.
Yardly
.
They
're
both
going
on
the
France
.
''
He
was
on
his
way
to
his
duties
but
Abe
tried
to
detain
him
:
``
If
I
did
n't
have
to
go
by
way
of
Cherbourg
.
The
baggage
went
that
way
.
''
``
Get
your
baggage
in
New
York
,
''
said
Paul
,
receding
.
The
logic
of
the
suggestion
fitted
gradually
into
Abe
's
pitch
--
he
grew
rather
enthusiastic
about
being
cared
for
,
or
rather
of
prolonging
his
state
of
irresponsibility
.
Other
clients
had
meanwhile
drifted
in
to
the
bar
:
first
came
a
huge
Dane
whom
Abe
had
somewhere
encountered
.
The
Dane
took
a
seat
across
the
room
,
and
Abe
guessed
he
would
be
there
all
the
day
,
drinking
,
lunching
,
talking
or
reading
newspapers
.
He
felt
a
desire
to
out-stay
him
.
At
eleven
the
college
boys
began
to
step
in
,
stepping
gingerly
lest
they
tear
one
another
bag
from
bag
.
It
was
about
then
he
had
the
chasseur
telephone
to
the
Divers
;
by
the
time
he
was
in
touch
with
them
he
was
in
touch
also
with
other
friends
--
and
his
hunch
was
to
put
them
all
on
different
phones
at
once
--
the
result
was
somewhat
general
.
From
time
to
time
his
mind
reverted
to
the
fact
that
he
ought
to
go
over
and
get
Freeman
out
of
jail
,
but
he
shook
off
all
facts
as
parts
of
the
nightmare
.
By
one
o'clock
the
bar
was
jammed
;
amidst
the
consequent
mixture
of
voices
the
staff
of
waiters
functioned
,
pinning
down
their
clients
to
the
facts
of
drink
and
money
.
``
That
makes
two
stingers
.
.
.
and
one
more
.
.
.
two
martinis
and
one
.
.
.
nothing
for
you
,
Mr.
Quarterly
.
.
.
that
makes
three
rounds
.
That
makes
seventy-five
francs
,
Mr.
Quarterly
.
Mr.
Schaeffer
said
he
had
this
--
you
had
the
last
.
.
.
I
can
only
do
what
you
say
.
.
.
thanks
vera-much
.
''
In
the
confusion
Abe
had
lost
his
seat
;
now
he
stood
gently
swaying
and
talking
to
some
of
the
people
with
whom
he
had
involved
himself
.
A
terrier
ran
a
leash
around
his
legs
but
Abe
managed
to
extricate
himself
without
upsetting
and
became
the
recipient
of
profuse
apologies
.
Presently
he
was
invited
to
lunch
,
but
declined
.
It
was
almost
Briglith
,
he
explained
,
and
there
was
something
he
had
to
do
at
Briglith
.
A
little
later
,
with
the
exquisite
manners
of
the
alcoholic
that
are
like
the
manners
of
a
prisoner
or
a
family
servant
,
he
said
good-by
to
an
acquaintance
,
and
turning
around
discovered
that
the
bar
's
great
moment
was
over
as
precipitately
as
it
had
begun
.
Across
from
him
the
Dane
and
his
companions
had
ordered
luncheon
.
Abe
did
likewise
but
scarcely
touched
it
.
Afterwards
,
he
just
sat
,
happy
to
live
in
the
past
.
The
drink
made
past
happy
things
contemporary
with
the
present
,
as
if
they
were
still
going
on
,
contemporary
even
with
the
future
as
if
they
were
about
to
happen
again
.
At
four
the
chasseur
approached
him
:
``
You
wish
to
see
a
colored
fellow
of
the
name
Jules
Peterson
?
''
``
God
!
How
did
he
find
me
?
''
``
I
did
n't
tell
him
you
were
present
.
''
``
Who
did
?
''
Abe
fell
over
his
glasses
but
recovered
himself
.
``
Says
he
's
already
been
around
to
all
the
American
bars
and
hotels
.
''
``
Tell
him
I
'm
not
here
--
''
As
the
chasseur
turned
away
Abe
asked
:
``
Can
he
come
in
here
?
''
``
I
'll
find
out
.
''
Receiving
the
question
Paul
glanced
over
his
shoulder
;
he
shook
his
head
,
then
seeing
Abe
he
came
over
.
``
I
'm
sorry
;
I
ca
n't
allow
it
.
''
Abe
got
himself
up
with
an
effort
and
went
out
to
the
Rue
Cambon
.
XXIV
With
his
miniature
leather
brief-case
in
his
hand
Richard
Diver
walked
from
the
seventh
arrondisement
--
where
he
left
a
note
for
Maria
Wallis
signed
``
Dicole
,
''
the
word
with
which
he
and
Nicole
had
signed
communications
in
the
first
days
of
love
--
to
his
shirt-makers
where
the
clerks
made
a
fuss
over
him
out
of
proportion
to
the
money
he
spent
.
Ashamed
at
promising
so
much
to
these
poor
Englishmen
,
with
his
fine
manners
,
his
air
of
having
the
key
to
security
,
ashamed
of
making
a
tailor
shift
an
inch
of
silk
on
his
arm
.
Afterward
he
went
to
the
bar
of
the
Crillon
and
drank
a
small
coffee
and
two
fingers
of
gin
.
As
he
entered
the
hotel
the
halls
had
seemed
unnaturally
bright
;
when
he
left
he
realized
that
it
was
because
it
had
already
turned
dark
outside
.
It
was
a
windy
four-o'clock
night
with
the
leaves
on
the
Champs
Élysées
singing
and
failing
,
thin
and
wild
.
Dick
turned
down
the
Rue
de
Rivoli
,
walking
two
squares
under
the
arcades
to
his
bank
where
there
was
mail
.
Then
he
took
a
taxi
and
started
up
the
Champs
Élysées
through
the
first
patter
of
rain
,
sitting
alone
with
his
love
.
Back
at
two
o'clock
in
the
Roi
George
corridor
the
beauty
of
Nicole
had
been
to
the
beauty
of
Rosemary
as
the
beauty
of
Leonardo
's
girl
was
to
that
of
the
girl
of
an
illustrator
.
Dick
moved
on
through
the
rain
,
demoniac
and
frightened
,
the
passions
of
many
men
inside
him
and
nothing
simple
that
he
could
see
.
Rosemary
opened
her
door
full
of
emotions
no
one
else
knew
of
.
She
was
now
what
is
sometimes
called
a
``
little
wild
thing
''
--
by
twenty-four
full
hours
she
was
not
yet
unified
and
she
was
absorbed
in
playing
around
with
chaos
;
as
if
her
destiny
were
a
picture
puzzle
--
counting
benefits
,
counting
hopes
,
telling
off
Dick
,
Nicole
,
her
mother
,
the
director
she
met
yesterday
,
like
stops
on
a
string
of
beads
.
When
Dick
knocked
she
had
just
dressed
and
been
watching
the
rain
,
thinking
of
some
poem
,
and
of
full
gutters
in
Beverly
Hills
.
When
she
opened
the
door
she
saw
him
as
something
fixed
and
Godlike
as
he
had
always
been
,
as
older
people
are
to
younger
,
rigid
and
unmalleable
.
Dick
saw
her
with
an
inevitable
sense
of
disappointment
.
It
took
him
a
moment
to
respond
to
the
unguarded
sweetness
of
her
smile
,
her
body
calculated
to
a
millimeter
to
suggest
a
bud
yet
guarantee
a
flower
.
He
was
conscious
of
the
print
of
her
wet
foot
on
a
rug
through
the
bathroom
door
.
``
Miss
Television
,
''
he
said
with
a
lightness
he
did
not
feel
.
He
put
his
gloves
,
his
brief-case
on
the
dressing-table
,
his
stick
against
the
wall
.
His
chin
dominated
the
lines
of
pain
around
his
mouth
,
forcing
them
up
into
his
forehead
and
the
corner
of
his
eyes
,
like
fear
that
can
not
be
shown
in
public
.
``
Come
and
sit
on
my
lap
close
to
me
,
''
he
said
softly
,
``
and
let
me
see
about
your
lovely
mouth
.
''
She
came
over
and
sat
there
and
while
the
dripping
slowed
down
outside
--
drip
--
dri-i-ip
,
she
laid
her
lips
to
the
beautiful
cold
image
she
had
created
.
Presently
she
kissed
him
several
times
in
the
mouth
,
her
face
getting
big
as
it
came
up
to
him
;
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
dazzling
as
the
quality
of
her
skin
,
and
since
sometimes
beauty
gives
back
the
images
of
one
's
best
thoughts
he
thought
of
his
responsibility
about
Nicole
,
and
of
the
responsibility
of
her
being
two
doors
down
across
the
corridor
.
``
The
rain
's
over
,
''
he
said
.
``
Do
you
see
the
sun
on
the
slate
?
''
Rosemary
stood
up
and
leaned
down
and
said
her
most
sincere
thing
to
him
:
``
Oh
,
we
're
such
actors
--
you
and
I
.
''
She
went
to
her
dresser
and
the
moment
that
she
laid
her
comb
flat
against
her
hair
there
was
a
slow
persistent
knocking
at
the
door
.
They
were
shocked
motionless
;
the
knock
was
repeated
insistently
,
and
in
the
sudden
realization
that
the
door
was
not
locked
Rosemary
finished
her
hair
with
one
stroke
,
nodded
at
Dick
who
had
quickly
jerked
the
wrinkles
out
of
the
bed
where
they
had
been
sitting
,
and
started
for
the
door
.
Dick
said
in
quite
a
natural
voice
,
not
too
loud
:
``
--
so
if
you
do
n't
feel
up
to
going
out
,
I
'll
tell
Nicole
and
we
'll
have
a
very
quiet
last
evening
.
''
The
precautions
were
needless
for
the
situation
of
the
parties
outside
the
door
was
so
harassed
as
to
preclude
any
but
the
most
fleeting
judgments
on
matters
not
pertinent
to
themselves
.
Standing
there
was
Abe
,
aged
by
several
months
in
the
last
twenty-four
hours
,
and
a
very
frightened
,
concerned
colored
man
whom
Abe
introduced
as
Mr.
Peterson
of
Stockholm
.
``
He
's
in
a
terrible
situation
and
it
's
my
fault
,
''
said
Abe
.
``
We
need
some
good
advice
.
''
``
Come
in
our
rooms
,
''
said
Dick
.
Abe
insisted
that
Rosemary
come
too
and
they
crossed
the
hall
to
the
Divers
'
suite
.
Jules
Peterson
,
a
small
,
respectable
Negro
,
on
the
suave
model
that
heels
the
Republican
party
in
the
border
States
,
followed
.
It
appeared
that
the
latter
had
been
a
legal
witness
to
the
early
morning
dispute
in
Montparnasse
;
he
had
accompanied
Abe
to
the
police
station
and
supported
his
assertion
that
a
thousand
franc
note
had
been
seized
out
of
his
hand
by
a
Negro
,
whose
identification
was
one
of
the
points
of
the
case
.
Abe
and
Jules
Peterson
,
accompanied
by
an
agent
of
police
,
returned
to
the
bistro
and
too
hastily
identified
as
the
criminal
a
Negro
,
who
,
so
it
was
established
after
an
hour
,
had
only
entered
the
place
after
Abe
left
.
The
police
had
further
complicated
the
situation
by
arresting
the
prominent
Negro
restaurateur
,
Freeman
,
who
had
only
drifted
through
the
alcoholic
fog
at
a
very
early
stage
and
then
vanished
.
The
true
culprit
,
whose
case
,
as
reported
by
his
friends
,
was
that
he
had
merely
commandeered
a
fifty-franc
note
to
pay
for
drinks
that
Abe
had
ordered
,
had
only
recently
and
in
a
somewhat
sinister
rôle
,
reappeared
upon
the
scene
.
In
brief
,
Abe
had
succeeded
in
the
space
of
an
hour
in
entangling
himself
with
the
personal
lives
,
consciences
,
and
emotions
of
one
Afro-European
and
three
Afro-Americans
inhabiting
the
French
Latin
quarter
.
The
disentanglement
was
not
even
faintly
in
sight
and
the
day
had
passed
in
an
atmosphere
of
unfamiliar
Negro
faces
bobbing
up
in
unexpected
places
and
around
unexpected
corners
,
and
insistent
Negro
voices
on
the
phone
.
In
person
,
Abe
had
succeeded
in
evading
all
of
them
,
save
Jules
Peterson
.
Peterson
was
rather
in
the
position
of
the
friendly
Indian
who
had
helped
a
white
.
The
Negroes
who
suffered
from
the
betrayal
were
not
so
much
after
Abe
as
after
Peterson
,
and
Peterson
was
very
much
after
what
protection
he
might
get
from
Abe
.
Up
in
Stockholm
Peterson
had
failed
as
a
small
manufacturer
of
shoe
polish
and
now
possessed
only
his
formula
and
sufficient
trade
tools
to
fill
a
small
box
;
however
,
his
new
protector
had
promised
in
the
early
hours
to
set
him
up
in
business
in
Versailles
.
Abe
's
former
chauffeur
was
a
shoemaker
there
and
Abe
had
handed
Peterson
two
hundred
francs
on
account
.
Rosemary
listened
with
distaste
to
this
rigmarole
;
to
appreciate
its
grotesquerie
required
a
more
robust
sense
of
humor
than
hers
.
The
little
man
with
his
portable
manufactory
,
his
insincere
eyes
that
,
from
time
to
time
,
rolled
white
semicircles
of
panic
into
view
;
the
figure
of
Abe
,
his
face
as
blurred
as
the
gaunt
fine
lines
of
it
would
permit
--
all
this
was
as
remote
from
her
as
sickness
.
``
I
ask
only
a
chance
in
life
,
''
said
Peterson
with
the
sort
of
precise
yet
distorted
intonation
peculiar
to
colonial
countries
.
``
My
methods
are
simple
,
my
formula
is
so
good
that
I
was
drove
away
from
Stockholm
,
ruined
,
because
I
did
not
care
to
dispose
of
it
.
''
Dick
regarded
him
politely
--
interest
formed
,
dissolved
,
he
turned
to
Abe
:
``
You
go
to
some
hotel
and
go
to
bed
.
After
you
're
all
straight
Mr.
Peterson
will
come
and
see
you
.
''
``
But
do
n't
you
appreciate
the
mess
that
Peterson
's
in
?
''
Abe
protested
.
``
I
shall
wait
in
the
hall
,
''
said
Mr.
Peterson
with
delicacy
.
``
It
is
perhaps
hard
to
discuss
my
problems
in
front
of
me
.
''
He
withdrew
after
a
short
travesty
of
a
French
bow
;
Abe
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
with
the
deliberation
of
a
locomotive
.
``
I
do
n't
seem
highly
popular
to-day
.
''
``
Popular
but
not
probable
,
''
Dick
advised
him
.
``
My
advice
is
to
leave
this
hotel
--
by
way
of
the
bar
,
if
you
want
.
Go
to
the
Chambord
,
or
if
you
'll
need
a
lot
of
service
,
go
over
to
the
Majestic
.
''
``
Could
I
annoy
you
for
a
drink
?
''
``
There
's
not
a
thing
up
here
,
''
Dick
lied
.
Resignedly
Abe
shook
hands
with
Rosemary
;
he
composed
his
face
slowly
,
holding
her
hand
a
long
time
and
forming
sentences
that
did
not
emerge
.
``
You
are
the
most
--
one
of
the
most
--
''
She
was
sorry
,
and
rather
revolted
at
his
dirty
hands
,
but
she
laughed
in
a
well-bred
way
,
as
though
it
were
nothing
unusual
to
her
to
watch
a
man
walking
in
a
slow
dream
.
Often
people
display
a
curious
respect
for
a
man
drunk
,
rather
like
the
respect
of
simple
races
for
the
insane
.
Respect
rather
than
fear
.
There
is
something
awe-inspiring
in
one
who
has
lost
all
inhibitions
,
who
will
do
anything
.
Of
course
we
make
him
pay
afterward
for
his
moment
of
superiority
,
his
moment
of
impressiveness
.
Abe
turned
to
Dick
with
a
last
appeal
.
``
If
I
go
to
a
hotel
and
get
all
steamed
and
curry-combed
,
and
sleep
awhile
,
and
fight
off
these
Senegalese
--
could
I
come
and
spend
the
evening
by
the
fireside
?
''
Dick
nodded
at
him
,
less
in
agreement
than
in
mockery
and
said
:
``
You
have
a
high
opinion
of
your
current
capacities
.
''
``
I
bet
if
Nicole
was
here
she
'd
let
me
come
back
.
''
``
All
right
.
''
Dick
went
to
a
trunk
tray
and
brought
a
box
to
the
central
table
;
inside
were
innumerable
cardboard
letters
.
``
You
can
come
if
you
want
to
play
anagrams
.
''
Abe
eyed
the
contents
of
the
box
with
physical
revulsion
,
as
though
he
had
been
asked
to
eat
them
like
oats
.
``
What
are
anagrams
?
Have
n't
I
had
enough
strange
--
''
``
It
's
a
quiet
game
.
You
spell
words
with
them
--
any
word
except
alcohol
.
''
``
I
bet
you
can
spell
alcohol
,
''
Abe
plunged
his
hand
among
the
counters
.
``
Can
I
come
back
if
I
can
spell
alcohol
?
''
``
You
can
come
back
if
you
want
to
play
anagrams
.
''
Abe
shook
his
head
resignedly
.
``
If
you
're
in
that
frame
of
mind
there
's
no
use
--
I
'd
just
be
in
the
way
.
''
He
waved
his
finger
reproachfully
at
Dick
.
``
But
remember
what
George
the
third
said
,
that
if
Grant
was
drunk
he
wished
he
would
bite
the
other
generals
.
''
With
a
last
desperate
glance
at
Rosemary
from
the
golden
corners
of
his
eyes
,
he
went
out
.
To
his
relief
Peterson
was
no
longer
in
the
corridor
.
Feeling
lost
and
homeless
he
went
back
to
ask
Paul
the
name
of
that
boat
.
XXV
When
he
had
tottered
out
,
Dick
and
Rosemary
embraced
fleetingly
.
There
was
a
dust
of
Paris
over
both
of
them
through
which
they
scented
each
other
:
the
rubber
guard
on
Dick
's
fountain
pen
,
the
faintest
odor
of
warmth
from
Rosemary
's
neck
and
shoulders
.
For
another
half-minute
Dick
clung
to
the
situation
;
Rosemary
was
first
to
return
to
reality
.
``
I
must
go
,
youngster
,
''
she
said
.
They
blinked
at
each
other
across
a
widening
space
,
and
Rosemary
made
an
exit
that
she
had
learned
young
,
and
on
which
no
director
had
ever
tried
to
improve
.
She
opened
the
door
of
her
room
and
went
directly
to
her
desk
where
she
had
suddenly
remembered
leaving
her
wristwatch
.
It
was
there
;
slipping
it
on
she
glanced
down
at
the
daily
letter
to
her
mother
,
finishing
the
last
sentence
in
her
mind
.
Then
,
rather
gradually
,
she
realized
without
turning
about
that
she
was
not
alone
in
the
room
.
In
an
inhabited
room
there
are
refracting
objects
only
half
noticed
:
varnished
wood
,
more
or
less
polished
brass
,
silver
and
ivory
,
and
beyond
these
a
thousand
conveyers
of
light
and
shadow
so
mild
that
one
scarcely
thinks
of
them
as
that
,
the
tops
of
picture-frames
,
the
edges
of
pencils
or
ash-trays
,
of
crystal
or
china
ornaments
;
the
totality
of
this
refraction
--
appealing
to
equally
subtle
reflexes
of
the
vision
as
well
as
to
those
associational
fragments
in
the
subconscious
that
we
seem
to
hang
on
to
,
as
a
glass-fitter
keeps
the
irregularly
shaped
pieces
that
may
do
some
time
--
this
fact
might
account
for
what
Rosemary
afterward
mystically
described
as
``
realizing
''
that
there
was
some
one
in
the
room
,
before
she
could
determine
it
.
But
when
she
did
realize
it
she
turned
swift
in
a
sort
of
ballet
step
and
saw
that
a
dead
Negro
was
stretched
upon
her
bed
.
As
she
cried
``
aaouu
!
''
and
her
still
unfastened
wristwatch
banged
against
the
desk
she
had
the
preposterous
idea
that
it
was
Abe
North
.
Then
she
dashed
for
the
door
and
across
the
hall
.
Dick
was
straightening
up
;
he
had
examined
the
gloves
worn
that
day
and
thrown
them
into
a
pile
of
soiled
gloves
in
a
corner
of
a
trunk
.
He
had
hung
up
coat
and
vest
and
spread
his
shirt
on
another
hanger
--
a
trick
of
his
own
.
``
You
'll
wear
a
shirt
that
's
a
little
dirty
where
you
wo
n't
wear
a
mussed
shirt
.
''
Nicole
had
come
in
and
was
dumping
one
of
Abe
's
extraordinary
ash-trays
into
the
waste-basket
when
Rosemary
tore
into
the
room
.
``
Dick
!
Dick
!
Come
and
see
!
''
Dick
jogged
across
the
hall
into
her
room
.
He
knelt
to
Peterson
's
heart
,
and
felt
the
pulse
--
the
body
was
warm
,
the
face
,
harassed
and
indirect
in
life
,
was
gross
and
bitter
in
death
;
the
box
of
materials
was
held
under
one
arm
but
the
shoe
that
dangled
over
the
bedside
was
bare
of
polish
and
its
sole
was
worn
through
.
By
French
law
Dick
had
no
right
to
touch
the
body
but
he
moved
the
arm
a
little
to
see
something
--
there
was
a
stain
on
the
green
coverlet
,
there
would
be
faint
blood
on
the
blanket
beneath
.
Dick
closed
the
door
and
stood
thinking
;
he
heard
cautious
steps
in
the
corridor
and
then
Nicole
calling
him
by
name
.
Opening
the
door
he
whispered
:
``
Bring
the
couverture
and
top
blanket
from
one
of
our
beds
--
do
n't
let
any
one
see
you
.
''
Then
,
noticing
the
strained
look
on
her
face
,
he
added
quickly
,
``
Look
here
,
you
must
n't
get
upset
over
this
--
it
's
only
some
nigger
scrap
.
''
``
I
want
it
to
be
over
.
''
The
body
,
as
Dick
lifted
it
,
was
light
and
ill-nourished
.
He
held
it
so
that
further
hemorrhages
from
the
wound
would
flow
into
the
man
's
clothes
.
Laying
it
beside
the
bed
he
stripped
off
the
coverlet
and
top
blanket
and
then
opening
the
door
an
inch
,
listened
--
there
was
a
clank
of
dishes
down
the
hall
followed
by
a
loud
patronizing
``
Merci
,
Madame
,
''
but
the
waiter
went
in
the
other
direction
,
toward
the
service
stairway
.
Quickly
Dick
and
Nicole
exchanged
bundles
across
the
corridor
;
after
spreading
this
covering
on
Rosemary
's
bed
,
Dick
stood
sweating
in
the
warm
twilight
,
considering
.
Certain
points
had
become
apparent
to
him
in
the
moment
following
his
examination
of
the
body
;
first
,
that
Abe
's
first
hostile
Indian
had
tracked
the
friendly
Indian
and
discovered
him
in
the
corridor
,
and
when
the
latter
had
taken
desperate
refuge
in
Rosemary
's
room
,
had
hunted
down
and
slain
him
;
second
,
that
if
the
situation
were
allowed
to
develop
naturally
,
no
power
on
earth
could
keep
the
smear
off
Rosemary
--
the
paint
was
scarcely
dry
on
the
Arbuckle
case
.
Her
contract
was
contingent
upon
an
obligation
to
continue
rigidly
and
unexceptionally
as
``
Daddy
's
Girl
.
''
Automatically
Dick
made
the
old
motion
of
turning
up
his
sleeves
though
he
wore
a
sleeveless
undershirt
,
and
bent
over
the
body
.
Getting
a
purchase
on
the
shoulders
of
the
coat
he
kicked
open
the
door
with
his
heel
,
and
dragged
the
body
quickly
into
a
plausible
position
in
the
corridor
.
He
came
back
into
Rosemary
's
room
and
smoothed
back
the
grain
of
the
plush
floor
rug
.
Then
he
went
to
the
phone
in
his
suite
and
called
the
manager-owner
of
the
hotel
.
``
McBeth
?
--
it
's
Doctor
Diver
speaking
--
something
very
important
.
Are
we
on
a
more
or
less
private
line
?
''
It
was
good
that
he
had
made
the
extra
effort
which
had
firmly
entrenched
him
with
Mr.
McBeth
.
Here
was
one
use
for
all
the
pleasingness
that
Dick
had
expended
over
a
large
area
he
would
never
retrace
.
.
.
.
``
Going
out
of
the
suite
we
came
on
a
dead
Negro
.
.
.
in
the
hall
.
.
.
no
,
no
,
he
's
a
civilian
.
Wait
a
minute
now
--
I
knew
you
did
n't
want
any
guests
to
blunder
on
the
body
so
I
'm
phoning
you
.
Of
course
I
must
ask
you
to
keep
my
name
out
of
it
.
I
do
n't
want
any
French
red
tape
just
because
I
discovered
the
man
.
''
What
exquisite
consideration
for
the
hotel
!
Only
because
Mr.
McBeth
,
with
his
own
eyes
,
had
seen
these
traits
in
Doctor
Diver
two
nights
before
,
could
he
credit
the
story
without
question
.
In
a
minute
Mr.
McBeth
arrived
and
in
another
minute
he
was
joined
by
a
gendarme
.
In
the
interval
he
found
time
to
whisper
to
Dick
,
``
You
can
be
sure
the
name
of
any
guest
will
be
protected
.
I
'm
only
too
grateful
to
you
for
your
pains
.
''
Mr.
McBeth
took
an
immediate
step
that
may
only
be
imagined
,
but
that
influenced
the
gendarme
so
as
to
make
him
pull
his
mustaches
in
a
frenzy
of
uneasiness
and
greed
.
He
made
perfunctory
notes
and
sent
a
telephone
call
to
his
post
.
Meanwhile
with
a
celerity
that
Jules
Peterson
,
as
a
business
man
,
would
have
quite
understood
,
the
remains
were
carried
into
another
apartment
of
one
of
the
most
fashionable
hotels
in
the
world
.
Dick
went
back
to
his
salon
.
``
What
happened
?
''
cried
Rosemary
.
``
Do
all
the
Americans
in
Paris
just
shoot
at
each
other
all
the
time
?
''
``
This
seems
to
be
the
open
season
,
''
he
answered
.
``
Where
's
Nicole
?
''
``
I
think
she
's
in
the
bathroom
.
''
She
adored
him
for
saving
her
--
disasters
that
could
have
attended
upon
the
event
had
passed
in
prophecy
through
her
mind
;
and
she
had
listened
in
wild
worship
to
his
strong
,
sure
,
polite
voice
making
it
all
right
.
But
before
she
reached
him
in
a
sway
of
soul
and
body
his
attention
focussed
on
something
else
:
he
went
into
the
bedroom
and
toward
the
bathroom
.
And
now
Rosemary
,
too
,
could
hear
,
louder
and
louder
,
a
verbal
inhumanity
that
penetrated
the
keyholes
and
the
cracks
in
the
doors
,
swept
into
the
suite
and
in
the
shape
of
horror
took
form
again
.
With
the
idea
that
Nicole
had
fallen
in
the
bathroom
and
hurt
herself
,
Rosemary
followed
Dick
.
That
was
not
the
condition
of
affairs
at
which
she
stared
before
Dick
shouldered
her
back
and
brusquely
blocked
her
view
.
Nicole
knelt
beside
the
tub
swaying
sidewise
and
sidewise
.
``
It
's
you
!
''
she
cried
,
``
--
it
's
you
come
to
intrude
on
the
only
privacy
I
have
in
the
world
--
with
your
spread
with
red
blood
on
it
.
I
'll
wear
it
for
you
--
I
'm
not
ashamed
,
though
it
was
such
a
pity
.
On
All
Fools
Day
we
had
a
party
on
the
Zurichsee
,
and
all
the
fools
were
there
,
and
I
wanted
to
come
dressed
in
a
spread
but
they
would
n't
let
me
--
''
``
Control
yourself
!
''
``
--
so
I
sat
in
the
bathroom
and
they
brought
me
a
domino
and
said
wear
that
.
I
did
.
What
else
could
I
do
?
''
``
Control
yourself
,
Nicole
!
''
``
I
never
expected
you
to
love
me
--
it
was
too
late
--
only
do
n't
come
in
the
bathroom
,
the
only
place
I
can
go
for
privacy
,
dragging
spreads
with
red
blood
on
them
and
asking
me
to
fix
them
.
''
``
Control
yourself
.
Get
up
--
''
Rosemary
,
back
in
the
salon
,
heard
the
bathroom
door
bang
,
and
stood
trembling
:
now
she
knew
what
Violet
McKisco
had
seen
in
the
bathroom
at
Villa
Diana
.
She
answered
the
ringing
phone
and
almost
cried
with
relief
when
she
found
it
was
Collis
Clay
,
who
had
traced
her
to
the
Divers
'
apartment
.
She
asked
him
to
come
up
while
she
got
her
hat
,
because
she
was
afraid
to
go
into
her
room
alone
.
BOOK
2
I
In
the
spring
of
1917
,
when
Doctor
Richard
Diver
first
arrived
in
Zurich
,
he
was
twenty-six
years
old
,
a
fine
age
for
a
man
,
indeed
the
very
acme
of
bachelorhood
.
Even
in
war-time
days
,
it
was
a
fine
age
for
Dick
,
who
was
already
too
valuable
,
too
much
of
a
capital
investment
to
be
shot
off
in
a
gun
.
Years
later
it
seemed
to
him
that
even
in
this
sanctuary
he
did
not
escape
lightly
,
but
about
that
he
never
fully
made
up
his
mind
--
in
1917
he
laughed
at
the
idea
,
saying
apologetically
that
the
war
did
n't
touch
him
at
all
.
Instructions
from
his
local
board
were
that
he
was
to
complete
his
studies
in
Zurich
and
take
a
degree
as
he
had
planned
.
Switzerland
was
an
island
,
washed
on
one
side
by
the
waves
of
thunder
around
Gorizia
and
on
another
by
the
cataracts
along
the
Somme
and
the
Aisne
.
For
once
there
seemed
more
intriguing
strangers
than
sick
ones
in
the
cantons
,
but
that
had
to
be
guessed
at
--
the
men
who
whispered
in
the
little
cafés
of
Berne
and
Geneva
were
as
likely
to
be
diamond
salesmen
or
commercial
travellers
.
However
,
no
one
had
missed
the
long
trains
of
blinded
or
one-legged
men
,
or
dying
trunks
,
that
crossed
each
other
between
the
bright
lakes
of
Constance
and
Neuchâtel
.
In
the
beer-halls
and
shop-windows
were
bright
posters
presenting
the
Swiss
defending
their
frontiers
in
1914
--
with
inspiring
ferocity
young
men
and
old
men
glared
down
from
the
mountains
at
phantom
French
and
Germans
;
the
purpose
was
to
assure
the
Swiss
heart
that
it
had
shared
the
contagious
glory
of
those
days
.
As
the
massacre
continued
the
posters
withered
away
,
and
no
country
was
more
surprised
than
its
sister
republic
when
the
United
States
bungled
its
way
into
the
war
.
Doctor
Diver
had
seen
around
the
edges
of
the
war
by
that
time
:
he
was
an
Oxford
Rhodes
Scholar
from
Connecticut
in
1914
.
He
returned
home
for
a
final
year
at
Johns
Hopkins
,
and
took
his
degree
.
In
1916
he
managed
to
get
to
Vienna
under
the
impression
that
,
if
he
did
not
make
haste
,
the
great
Freud
would
eventually
succumb
to
an
aeroplane
bomb
.
Even
then
Vienna
was
old
with
death
but
Dick
managed
to
get
enough
coal
and
oil
to
sit
in
his
room
in
the
Damenstiff
Strasse
and
write
the
pamphlets
that
he
later
destroyed
,
but
that
,
rewritten
,
were
the
backbone
of
the
book
he
published
in
Zurich
in
1920
.
Most
of
us
have
a
favorite
,
a
heroic
period
,
in
our
lives
and
that
was
Dick
Diver
's
.
For
one
thing
he
had
no
idea
that
he
was
charming
,
that
the
affection
he
gave
and
inspired
was
anything
unusual
among
healthy
people
.
In
his
last
year
at
New
Haven
some
one
referred
to
him
as
``
lucky
Dick
''
--
the
name
lingered
in
his
head
.
``
Lucky
Dick
,
you
big
stiff
,
''
he
would
whisper
to
himself
,
walking
around
the
last
sticks
of
flame
in
his
room
.
``
You
hit
it
,
my
boy
.
Nobody
knew
it
was
there
before
you
came
along
.
''
At
the
beginning
of
1917
,
when
it
was
becoming
difficult
to
find
coal
,
Dick
burned
for
fuel
almost
a
hundred
textbooks
that
he
had
accumulated
;
but
only
,
as
he
laid
each
one
on
the
fire
,
with
an
assurance
chuckling
inside
him
that
he
was
himself
a
digest
of
what
was
within
the
book
,
that
he
could
brief
it
five
years
from
now
,
if
it
deserved
to
be
briefed
.
This
went
on
at
any
odd
hour
,
if
necessary
,
with
a
floor
rug
over
his
shoulders
,
with
the
fine
quiet
of
the
scholar
which
is
nearest
of
all
things
to
heavenly
peace
--
but
which
,
as
will
presently
be
told
,
had
to
end
.
For
its
temporary
continuance
he
thanked
his
body
that
had
done
the
flying
rings
at
New
Haven
,
and
now
swam
in
the
winter
Danube
.
With
Elkins
,
second
secretary
at
the
Embassy
,
he
shared
an
apartment
,
and
there
were
two
nice
girl
visitors
--
which
was
that
and
not
too
much
of
it
,
nor
too
much
of
the
Embassy
either
.
His
contact
with
Ed
Elkins
aroused
in
him
a
first
faint
doubt
as
to
the
quality
of
his
mental
processes
;
he
could
not
feel
that
they
were
profoundly
different
from
the
thinking
of
Elkins
--
Elkins
,
who
would
name
you
all
the
quarterbacks
in
New
Haven
for
thirty
years.
``
--
And
Lucky
Dick
ca
n't
be
one
of
these
clever
men
;
he
must
be
less
intact
,
even
faintly
destroyed
.
If
life
wo
n't
do
it
for
him
it
's
not
a
substitute
to
get
a
disease
,
or
a
broken
heart
,
or
an
inferiority
complex
,
though
it
'd
be
nice
to
build
out
some
broken
side
till
it
was
better
than
the
original
structure
.
''
He
mocked
at
his
reasoning
,
calling
it
specious
and
``
American
''
--
his
criteria
of
uncerebral
phrase-making
was
that
it
was
American
.
He
knew
,
though
,
that
the
price
of
his
intactness
was
incompleteness
.
``
The
best
I
can
wish
you
,
my
child
,
''
so
said
the
Fairy
Blackstick
in
Thackeray
's
The
Rose
and
the
Ring
,
``
is
a
little
misfortune
.
''
In
some
moods
he
griped
at
his
own
reasoning
:
Could
I
help
it
that
Pete
Livingstone
sat
in
the
locker-room
Tap
Day
when
everybody
looked
all
over
hell
for
him
?
And
I
got
an
election
when
otherwise
I
would
n't
have
got
Elihu
,
knowing
so
few
men
.
He
was
good
and
right
and
I
ought
to
have
sat
in
the
locker-room
instead
.
Maybe
I
would
,
if
I
'd
thought
I
had
a
chance
at
an
election
.
But
Mercer
kept
coming
to
my
room
all
those
weeks
.
I
guess
I
knew
I
had
a
chance
all
right
,
all
right
.
But
it
would
have
served
me
right
if
I
'd
swallowed
my
pin
in
the
shower
and
set
up
a
conflict
.
After
the
lectures
at
the
university
he
used
to
argue
this
point
with
a
young
Rumanian
intellectual
who
reassured
him
:
``
There
's
no
evidence
that
Goethe
ever
had
a
'conflict
'
in
the
modern
sense
,
or
a
man
like
Jung
,
for
instance
.
You
're
not
a
romantic
philosopher
--
you
're
a
scientist
.
Memory
,
force
,
character
--
especially
good
sense
.
That
's
going
to
be
your
trouble
--
judgment
about
yourself
--
once
I
knew
a
man
who
worked
two
years
on
the
brain
of
an
armadillo
,
with
the
idea
that
he
would
sooner
or
later
know
more
about
the
brain
of
an
armadillo
than
any
one
.
I
kept
arguing
with
him
that
he
was
not
really
pushing
out
the
extension
of
the
human
range
--
it
was
too
arbitrary
.
And
sure
enough
,
when
he
sent
his
work
to
the
medical
journal
they
refused
it
--
they
had
just
accepted
a
thesis
by
another
man
on
the
same
subject
.
''
Dick
got
up
to
Zurich
on
less
Achilles
'
heels
than
would
be
required
to
equip
a
centipede
,
but
with
plenty
--
the
illusions
of
eternal
strength
and
health
,
and
of
the
essential
goodness
of
people
;
illusions
of
a
nation
,
the
lies
of
generations
of
frontier
mothers
who
had
to
croon
falsely
,
that
there
were
no
wolves
outside
the
cabin
door
.
After
he
took
his
degree
,
he
received
his
orders
to
join
a
neurological
unit
forming
in
Bar-sur-Aube
.
In
France
,
to
his
disgust
,
the
work
was
executive
rather
than
practical
.
In
compensation
he
found
time
to
complete
the
short
textbook
and
assemble
the
material
for
his
next
venture
.
He
returned
to
Zurich
in
the
spring
of
1919
discharged
.
The
foregoing
has
the
ring
of
a
biography
,
without
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
the
hero
,
like
Grant
,
lolling
in
his
general
store
in
Galena
,
is
ready
to
be
called
to
an
intricate
destiny
.
Moreover
it
is
confusing
to
come
across
a
youthful
photograph
of
some
one
known
in
a
rounded
maturity
and
gaze
with
a
shock
upon
a
fiery
,
wiry
,
eagle-eyed
stranger
.
Best
to
be
reassuring
--
Dick
Diver
's
moment
now
began
.
II
It
was
a
damp
April
day
,
with
long
diagonal
clouds
over
the
Albishorn
and
water
inert
in
the
low
places
.
Zurich
is
not
unlike
an
American
city
.
Missing
something
ever
since
his
arrival
two
days
before
,
Dick
perceived
that
it
was
the
sense
he
had
had
in
finite
French
lanes
that
there
was
nothing
more
.
In
Zurich
there
was
a
lot
besides
Zurich
--
the
roofs
upled
the
eyes
to
tinkling
cow
pastures
,
which
in
turn
modified
hilltops
further
up
--
so
life
was
a
perpendicular
starting
off
to
a
postcard
heaven
.
The
Alpine
lands
,
home
of
the
toy
and
the
funicular
,
the
merry-go-round
and
the
thin
chime
,
were
not
a
being
here
,
as
in
France
with
French
vines
growing
over
one
's
feet
on
the
ground
.
In
Salzburg
once
Dick
had
felt
the
superimposed
quality
of
a
bought
and
borrowed
century
of
music
;
once
in
the
laboratories
of
the
university
in
Zurich
,
delicately
poking
at
the
cervical
of
a
brain
,
he
had
felt
like
a
toy-maker
rather
than
like
the
tornado
who
had
hurried
through
the
old
red
buildings
of
Hopkins
,
two
years
before
,
unstayed
by
the
irony
of
the
gigantic
Christ
in
the
entrance
hall
.
Yet
he
had
decided
to
remain
another
two
years
in
Zurich
,
for
he
did
not
underestimate
the
value
of
toy-making
,
in
infinite
precision
,
of
infinite
patience
.
To-day
he
went
out
to
see
Franz
Gregorovius
at
Dohmler
's
clinic
on
the
Zurichsee
.
Franz
,
resident
pathologist
at
the
clinic
,
a
Vaudois
by
birth
,
a
few
years
older
than
Dick
,
met
him
at
the
tram
stop
.
He
had
a
dark
and
magnificent
aspect
of
Cagliostro
about
him
,
contrasted
with
holy
eyes
;
he
was
the
third
of
the
Gregoroviuses
--
his
grandfather
had
instructed
Krapaelin
when
psychiatry
was
just
emerging
from
the
darkness
of
all
time
.
In
personality
he
was
proud
,
fiery
,
and
sheeplike
--
he
fancied
himself
as
a
hypnotist
.
If
the
original
genius
of
the
family
had
grown
a
little
tired
,
Franz
would
without
doubt
become
a
fine
clinician
.
On
the
way
to
the
clinic
he
said
:
``
Tell
me
of
your
experiences
in
the
war
.
Are
you
changed
like
the
rest
?
You
have
the
same
stupid
and
unaging
American
face
,
except
I
know
you
're
not
stupid
,
Dick
.
''
``
I
did
n't
see
any
of
the
war
--
you
must
have
gathered
that
from
my
letters
,
Franz
.
''
``
That
does
n't
matter
--
we
have
some
shell-shocks
who
merely
heard
an
air
raid
from
a
distance
.
We
have
a
few
who
merely
read
newspapers
.
''
``
It
sounds
like
nonsense
to
me
.
''
``
Maybe
it
is
,
Dick
.
But
,
we
're
a
rich
person
's
clinic
--
we
do
n't
use
the
word
nonsense
.
Frankly
,
did
you
come
down
to
see
me
or
to
see
that
girl
?
''
They
looked
sideways
at
each
other
;
Franz
smiled
enigmatically
.
``
Naturally
I
saw
all
the
first
letters
,
''
he
said
in
his
official
basso
.
``
When
the
change
began
,
delicacy
prevented
me
from
opening
any
more
.
Really
it
had
become
your
case
.
''
``
Then
she
's
well
?
''
Dick
demanded
.
``
Perfectly
well
,
I
have
charge
of
her
,
in
fact
I
have
charge
of
the
majority
of
the
English
and
American
patients
.
They
call
me
Doctor
Gregory
.
''
``
Let
me
explain
about
that
girl
,
''
Dick
said
.
``
I
only
saw
her
one
time
,
that
's
a
fact
.
When
I
came
out
to
say
good-by
to
you
just
before
I
went
over
to
France
.
It
was
the
first
time
I
put
on
my
uniform
and
I
felt
very
bogus
in
it
--
went
around
saluting
private
soldiers
and
all
that
.
''
``
Why
did
n't
you
wear
it
to-day
?
''
``
Hey
!
I
've
been
discharged
three
weeks
.
Here
's
the
way
I
happened
to
see
that
girl
.
When
I
left
you
I
walked
down
toward
that
building
of
yours
on
the
lake
to
get
my
bicycle
.
''
``
--
toward
the
'Cedars
'
?
''
``
--
a
wonderful
night
,
you
know
--
moon
over
that
mountain
--
''
``
The
Krenzegg
.
''
``
--
I
caught
up
with
a
nurse
and
a
young
girl
.
I
did
n't
think
the
girl
was
a
patient
;
I
asked
the
nurse
about
tram
times
and
we
walked
along
.
The
girl
was
about
the
prettiest
thing
I
ever
saw
.
''
``
She
still
is
.
''
``
She
'd
never
seen
an
American
uniform
and
we
talked
,
and
I
did
n't
think
anything
about
it
.
''
He
broke
off
,
recognizing
a
familiar
perspective
,
and
then
resumed
:
``
--
except
,
Franz
,
I
'm
not
as
hard-boiled
as
you
are
yet
;
when
I
see
a
beautiful
shell
like
that
I
ca
n't
help
feeling
a
regret
about
what
's
inside
it
.
That
was
absolutely
all
--
till
the
letters
began
to
come
.
''
``
It
was
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
her
,
''
said
Franz
dramatically
,
``
a
transference
of
the
most
fortuitous
kind
.
That
's
why
I
came
down
to
meet
you
on
a
very
busy
day
.
I
want
you
to
come
into
my
office
and
talk
a
long
time
before
you
see
her
.
In
fact
,
I
sent
her
into
Zurich
to
do
errands
.
''
His
voice
was
tense
with
enthusiasm
.
``
In
fact
,
I
sent
her
without
a
nurse
,
with
a
less
stable
patient
.
I
'm
intensely
proud
of
this
case
,
which
I
handled
,
with
your
accidental
assistance
.
''
The
car
had
followed
the
shore
of
the
Zurichsee
into
a
fertile
region
of
pasture
farms
and
low
hills
,
steepled
with
châlets
.
The
sun
swam
out
into
a
blue
sea
of
sky
and
suddenly
it
was
a
Swiss
valley
at
its
best
--
pleasant
sounds
and
murmurs
and
a
good
fresh
smell
of
health
and
cheer
.
Professor
Dohmler
's
plant
consisted
of
three
old
buildings
and
a
pair
of
new
ones
,
between
a
slight
eminence
and
the
shore
of
the
lake
.
At
its
founding
,
ten
years
before
,
it
had
been
the
first
modern
clinic
for
mental
illness
;
at
a
casual
glance
no
layman
would
recognize
it
as
a
refuge
for
the
broken
,
the
incomplete
,
the
menacing
,
of
this
world
,
though
two
buildings
were
surrounded
with
vine-softened
walls
of
a
deceptive
height
.
Some
men
raked
straw
in
the
sunshine
;
here
and
there
,
as
they
rode
into
the
grounds
,
the
car
passed
the
white
flag
of
a
nurse
waving
beside
a
patient
on
a
path
.
After
conducting
Dick
to
his
office
,
Franz
excused
himself
for
half
an
hour
.
Left
alone
Dick
wandered
about
the
room
and
tried
to
reconstruct
Franz
from
the
litter
of
his
desk
,
from
his
books
and
the
books
of
and
by
his
father
and
grandfather
;
from
the
Swiss
piety
of
a
huge
claret-colored
photo
of
the
former
on
the
wall
.
There
was
smoke
in
the
room
;
pushing
open
a
French
window
,
Dick
let
in
a
cone
of
sunshine
.
Suddenly
his
thoughts
swung
to
the
patient
,
the
girl
.
He
had
received
about
fifty
letters
from
her
written
over
a
period
of
eight
months
.
The
first
one
was
apologetic
,
explaining
that
she
had
heard
from
America
how
girls
wrote
to
soldiers
whom
they
did
not
know
.
She
had
obtained
the
name
and
address
from
Doctor
Gregory
and
she
hoped
he
would
not
mind
if
she
sometimes
sent
word
to
wish
him
well
,
etc.
,
etc
.
So
far
it
was
easy
to
recognize
the
tone
--
from
``
Daddy-Long-Legs
''
and
``
Molly-Make-Believe
,
''
sprightly
and
sentimental
epistolary
collections
enjoying
a
vogue
in
the
States
.
But
there
the
resemblance
ended
.
The
letters
were
divided
into
two
classes
,
of
which
the
first
class
,
up
to
about
the
time
of
the
armistice
,
was
of
marked
pathological
turn
,
and
of
which
the
second
class
,
running
from
thence
up
to
the
present
,
was
entirely
normal
,
and
displayed
a
richly
maturing
nature
.
For
these
latter
letters
Dick
had
come
to
wait
eagerly
in
the
last
dull
months
at
Bar-sur-Aube
--
yet
even
from
the
first
letters
he
had
pieced
together
more
than
Franz
would
have
guessed
of
the
story
.
MON
CAPITAINE
:
I
thought
when
I
saw
you
in
your
uniform
you
were
so
handsome
.
Then
I
thought
Je
m'en
fiche
French
too
and
German
.
You
thought
I
was
pretty
too
but
I
've
had
that
before
and
a
long
time
I
've
stood
it
.
If
you
come
here
again
with
that
attitude
base
and
criminal
and
not
even
faintly
what
I
had
been
taught
to
associate
with
the
role
of
gentleman
then
heaven
help
you
.
However
you
seem
quieter
than
the
others
,
(
2
)
all
soft
like
a
big
cat
.
I
have
only
gotten
to
like
boys
who
are
rather
sissies
.
Are
you
a
sissy
?
There
were
some
somewhere
.
Excuse
all
this
,
it
is
the
third
letter
I
have
written
you
and
will
send
immediately
or
will
never
send
.
I
've
thought
a
lot
about
moonlight
too
,
and
there
are
many
witnesses
I
could
find
if
I
could
only
be
out
of
here
.
(
3
)
They
said
you
were
a
doctor
,
but
so
long
as
you
are
a
cat
it
is
different
.
My
head
aches
so
,
so
excuse
this
walking
there
like
an
ordinary
with
a
white
cat
will
explain
,
I
think
.
I
can
speak
three
languages
,
four
with
English
,
and
am
sure
I
could
be
useful
interpreting
if
you
arrange
such
thing
in
France
I
'm
sure
I
could
control
everything
with
the
belts
all
bound
around
everybody
like
it
was
Wednesday
.
It
is
now
Saturday
and
(
4
)
you
are
far
away
,
perhaps
killed
.
Come
back
to
me
some
day
,
for
I
will
be
here
always
on
this
green
hill
.
Unless
they
will
let
me
write
my
father
,
whom
I
loved
dearly
.
Excuse
this
.
I
am
not
myself
today
.
I
will
write
when
I
feel
better
.
Cherio
NICOLE
WARREN

Excuse
all
this
.
CAPTAIN
DIVER
:
I
know
introspection
is
not
good
for
a
highly
nervous
state
like
mine
,
but
I
would
like
you
to
know
where
I
stand
.
Last
year
or
whenever
it
was
in
Chicago
when
I
got
so
I
could
n't
speak
to
servants
or
walk
in
the
street
I
kept
waiting
for
some
one
to
tell
me
.
It
was
the
duty
of
some
one
who
understood
.
The
blind
must
be
led
.
Only
no
one
would
tell
me
everything
--
they
would
just
tell
me
half
and
I
was
already
too
muddled
to
put
two
and
two
together
.
One
man
was
nice
--
he
was
a
French
officer
and
he
understood
.
He
gave
me
a
flower
and
said
it
was
``
plus
petite
et
(
2
)
moins
entendue
.
''
We
were
friends
.
Then
he
took
it
away
.
I
grew
sicker
and
there
was
no
one
to
explain
to
me
.
They
had
a
song
about
Joan
of
Arc
that
they
used
to
sing
at
me
but
that
was
just
mean
--
it
would
just
make
me
cry
,
for
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
my
head
then
.
They
kept
making
reference
to
sports
,
too
,
but
I
did
n't
care
by
that
time
.
So
there
was
that
day
I
went
walking
on
Michigan
Boulevard
on
and
on
for
miles
and
finally
they
followed
me
in
an
automobile
,
but
I
would
n't
get
(
3
)
in
.
Finally
they
pulled
me
in
and
there
were
nurses
.
After
that
time
I
began
to
realize
it
all
,
because
I
could
feel
what
was
happening
in
others
.
So
you
see
how
I
stand
.
And
what
good
can
it
be
for
me
to
stay
here
with
the
doctors
harping
constantly
in
the
things
I
was
here
to
get
over
.
So
today
I
have
written
my
father
to
come
and
take
me
away
.
I
am
glad
(
4
)
you
are
so
interested
in
examining
people
and
sending
them
back
.
It
must
be
so
much
fun
.
And
again
,
from
another
letter
:
You
might
pass
up
your
next
examination
and
write
me
a
letter
.
They
just
sent
me
some
phonograph
records
in
case
I
should
forget
my
lesson
and
I
broke
them
all
so
the
nurse
wo
n't
speak
to
me
.
They
were
in
English
,
so
that
the
nurses
would
not
understand
.
One
doctor
in
Chicago
said
I
was
bluffing
,
but
what
he
really
meant
was
that
I
was
a
twin
six
and
he
had
never
seen
one
before
.
But
I
was
very
busy
being
mad
then
,
so
I
did
n't
care
what
he
said
,
when
I
am
very
busy
being
mad
I
do
n't
usually
care
what
they
say
,
not
if
I
were
a
million
girls
.
You
told
me
that
night
you
'd
teach
me
to
play
.
Well
,
I
think
love
is
all
(
2
)
there
is
or
should
be
.
Anyhow
I
am
glad
your
interest
in
examinations
keeps
you
busy
.
Tout
à
vous
,
NICOLE
WARREN
.
There
were
other
letters
among
whose
helpless
cæsuras
lurked
darker
rhythms
.
DEAR
CAPTAIN
DIVER
:
I
write
to
you
because
there
is
no
one
else
to
whom
I
can
turn
and
it
seems
to
me
if
this
farcicle
situation
is
apparent
to
one
as
sick
as
me
it
should
be
apparent
to
you
.
The
mental
trouble
is
all
over
and
besides
that
I
am
completely
broken
and
humiliated
,
if
that
was
what
they
wanted
.
My
family
have
shamefully
neglected
me
,
there
's
no
use
asking
them
for
help
or
pity
.
I
have
had
enough
and
it
is
simply
ruining
my
health
and
wasting
my
time
pretending
that
what
is
the
matter
with
my
(
2
)
head
is
curable
.
Here
I
am
in
what
appears
to
be
a
semi-insane-asylum
,
all
because
nobody
saw
fit
to
tell
me
the
truth
about
anything
.
If
I
had
only
known
what
was
going
on
like
I
know
now
I
could
have
stood
it
I
guess
for
I
am
pretty
strong
,
but
those
who
should
have
,
did
not
see
fit
to
enlighten
me
.
(
3
)
And
now
,
when
I
know
and
have
paid
such
a
price
for
knowing
,
they
sit
there
with
their
dogs
lives
and
say
I
should
believe
what
I
did
believe
.
Especially
one
does
but
I
know
now
.
I
am
lonesome
all
the
time
far
away
from
friends
and
family
across
the
Atlantic
I
roam
all
over
the
place
in
a
half
daze
.
If
you
could
get
me
a
position
as
interpreter
(
I
know
French
and
German
like
a
native
,
fair
(
4
)
Italian
and
a
little
Spanish
)
or
in
the
Red
Cross
Ambulance
or
as
a
trained
nurse
,
though
I
would
have
to
train
you
would
prove
a
great
blessing
.
And
again
:
Since
you
will
not
accept
my
explanation
of
what
is
the
matter
you
could
at
least
explain
to
me
what
you
think
,
because
you
have
a
kind
cat
's
face
,
and
not
that
funny
look
that
seems
to
be
so
fashionable
here
.
Dr.
Gregory
gave
me
a
snapshot
of
you
,
not
as
handsome
as
you
are
in
your
uniform
,
but
younger
looking
.
MON
CAPITAINE
:
It
was
fine
to
have
your
postcard
.
I
am
so
glad
you
take
such
interest
in
disqualifying
nurses
--
oh
,
I
understood
your
note
very
well
indeed
.
Only
I
thought
from
the
moment
I
met
you
that
you
were
different
.
DEAR
CAPITAINE
:
I
think
one
thing
today
and
another
tomorrow
.
That
is
really
all
that
's
the
matter
with
me
,
except
a
crazy
defiance
and
a
lack
of
proportion
.
I
would
gladly
welcome
any
alienist
you
might
suggest
.
Here
they
lie
in
their
bath
tubs
and
sing
Play
in
Your
Own
Backyard
as
if
I
had
my
(
2
)
backyard
to
play
in
or
any
hope
which
I
can
find
by
looking
either
backward
or
forward
.
They
tried
it
again
in
the
candy
store
again
and
I
almost
hit
the
man
with
the
weight
,
but
they
held
me
.
I
am
not
going
to
write
you
any
more
.
I
am
too
unstable
.
And
then
a
month
with
no
letters
.
And
then
suddenly
the
change
.
--
I
am
slowly
coming
back
to
life
.
.
.
--
Today
the
flowers
and
the
clouds
.
.
.
--
The
war
is
over
and
I
scarcely
knew
there
was
a
war
.
.
.
--
How
kind
you
have
been
!
You
must
be
very
wise
behind
your
face
like
a
white
cat
,
except
you
do
n't
look
like
that
in
the
picture
Dr.
Gregory
gave
me
.
.
.
--
Today
I
went
to
Zurich
,
how
strange
a
feeling
to
see
a
city
again
.
--
Today
we
went
to
Berne
,
it
was
so
nice
with
the
clocks
.
--
Today
we
climbed
high
enough
to
find
asphodel
and
edelweiss
.
.
.
After
that
the
letters
were
fewer
,
but
he
answered
them
all
.
There
was
one
:
I
wish
someone
were
in
love
with
me
like
boys
were
ages
ago
before
I
was
sick
.
I
suppose
it
will
be
years
,
though
,
before
I
could
think
of
anything
like
that
.
But
when
Dick
's
answer
was
delayed
for
any
reason
,
there
was
a
fluttering
burst
of
worry
--
like
a
worry
of
a
lover
:
``
Perhaps
I
have
bored
you
,
''
and
:
``
Afraid
I
have
presumed
,
''
and
:
``
I
keep
thinking
at
night
you
have
been
sick
.
''
In
actuality
Dick
was
sick
with
the
flu
.
When
he
recovered
,
all
except
the
formal
part
of
his
correspondence
was
sacrificed
to
the
consequent
fatigue
,
and
shortly
afterward
the
memory
of
her
became
overlaid
by
the
vivid
presence
of
a
Wisconsin
telephone
girl
at
headquarters
in
Bar-sur-Aube
.
She
was
red-lipped
like
a
poster
,
and
known
obscenely
in
the
messes
as
``
The
Switchboard
.
''
Franz
came
back
into
his
office
feeling
self-important
.
Dick
thought
he
would
probably
be
a
fine
clinician
,
for
the
sonorous
or
staccato
cadences
by
which
he
disciplined
nurse
or
patient
came
not
from
his
nervous
system
but
from
a
tremendous
and
harmless
vanity
.
His
true
emotions
were
more
ordered
and
kept
to
himself
.
``
Now
about
the
girl
,
Dick
,
''
he
said
.
``
Of
course
,
I
want
to
find
out
about
you
and
tell
you
about
myself
,
but
first
about
the
girl
,
because
I
have
been
waiting
to
tell
you
about
it
so
long
.
''
He
searched
for
and
found
a
sheaf
of
papers
in
a
filing
cabinet
but
after
shuffling
through
them
he
found
they
were
in
his
way
and
put
them
on
his
desk
.
Instead
he
told
Dick
the
story
.
III
About
a
year
and
a
half
before
,
Doctor
Dohmler
had
some
vague
correspondence
with
an
American
gentleman
living
in
Lausanne
,
a
Mr.
Devereux
Warren
,
of
the
Warren
family
of
Chicago
.
A
meeting
was
arranged
and
one
day
Mr.
Warren
arrived
at
the
clinic
with
his
daughter
Nicole
,
a
girl
of
sixteen
.
She
was
obviously
not
well
and
the
nurse
who
was
with
her
took
her
to
walk
about
the
grounds
while
Mr.
Warren
had
his
consultation
.
Warren
was
a
strikingly
handsome
man
looking
less
than
forty
.
He
was
a
fine
American
type
in
every
way
,
tall
,
broad
,
well-made
--
''
un
homme
très
chic
,
''
as
Doctor
Dohmler
described
him
to
Franz
.
His
large
gray
eyes
were
sun-veined
from
rowing
on
Lake
Geneva
,
and
he
had
that
special
air
about
him
of
having
known
the
best
of
this
world
.
The
conversation
was
in
German
,
for
it
developed
that
he
had
been
educated
at
Göttingen
.
He
was
nervous
and
obviously
very
moved
by
his
errand
.
``
Doctor
Dohmler
,
my
daughter
is
n't
right
in
the
head
.
I
've
had
lots
of
specialists
and
nurses
for
her
and
she
's
taken
a
couple
of
rest
cures
but
the
thing
has
grown
too
big
for
me
and
I
've
been
strongly
recommended
to
come
to
you
.
''
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Doctor
Dohmler
.
``
Suppose
you
start
at
the
beginning
and
tell
me
everything
.
''
``
There
is
n't
any
beginning
,
at
least
there
is
n't
any
insanity
in
the
family
that
I
know
of
,
on
either
side
.
Nicole
's
mother
died
when
she
was
eleven
and
I
've
sort
of
been
father
and
mother
both
to
her
,
with
the
help
of
governesses
--
father
and
mother
both
to
her
.
''
He
was
very
moved
as
he
said
this
.
Doctor
Dohmler
saw
that
there
were
tears
in
the
corners
of
his
eyes
and
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
there
was
whiskey
on
his
breath
.
``
As
a
child
she
was
a
darling
thing
--
everybody
was
crazy
about
her
,
everybody
that
came
in
contact
with
her
.
She
was
smart
as
a
whip
and
happy
as
the
day
is
long
.
She
liked
to
read
or
draw
or
dance
or
play
the
piano
--
anything
.
I
used
to
hear
my
wife
say
she
was
the
only
one
of
our
children
who
never
cried
at
night
.
I
've
got
an
older
girl
,
too
,
and
there
was
a
boy
that
died
,
but
Nicole
was
--
Nicole
was
--
Nicole
--
''
He
broke
off
and
Doctor
Dohmler
helped
him
.
``
She
was
a
perfectly
normal
,
bright
,
happy
child
.
''
``
Perfectly
.
''
Doctor
Dohmler
waited
.
Mr.
Warren
shook
his
head
,
blew
a
long
sigh
,
glanced
quickly
at
Doctor
Dohmler
and
then
at
the
floor
again
.
``
About
eight
months
ago
,
or
maybe
it
was
six
months
ago
or
maybe
ten
--
I
try
to
figure
but
I
ca
n't
remember
exactly
where
we
were
when
she
began
to
do
funny
things
--
crazy
things
.
Her
sister
was
the
first
one
to
say
anything
to
me
about
it
--
because
Nicole
was
always
the
same
to
me
,
''
he
added
rather
hastily
,
as
if
some
one
had
accused
him
of
being
to
blame
,
``
--
the
same
loving
little
girl
.
The
first
thing
was
about
a
valet
.
''
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
Doctor
Dohmler
,
nodding
his
venerable
head
,
as
if
,
like
Sherlock
Holmes
,
he
had
expected
a
valet
and
only
a
valet
to
be
introduced
at
this
point
.
``
I
had
a
valet
--
been
with
me
for
years
--
Swiss
,
by
the
way
.
''
He
looked
up
for
Doctor
Dohmler
's
patriotic
approval
.
``
And
she
got
some
crazy
idea
about
him
.
She
thought
he
was
making
up
to
her
--
of
course
,
at
the
time
I
believed
her
and
I
let
him
go
,
but
I
know
now
it
was
all
nonsense
.
''
``
What
did
she
claim
he
had
done
?
''
``
That
was
the
first
thing
--
the
doctors
could
n't
pin
her
down
.
She
just
looked
at
them
as
if
they
ought
to
know
what
he
'd
done
.
But
she
certainly
meant
he
'd
made
some
kind
of
indecent
advances
to
her
--
she
did
n't
leave
us
in
any
doubt
of
that
.
''
``
I
see
.
''
``
Of
course
,
I
've
read
about
women
getting
lonesome
and
thinking
there
's
a
man
under
the
bed
and
all
that
,
but
why
should
Nicole
get
such
an
idea
?
She
could
have
all
the
young
men
she
wanted
.
We
were
in
Lake
Forest
--
that
's
a
summer
place
near
Chicago
where
we
have
a
place
--
and
she
was
out
all
day
playing
golf
or
tennis
with
boys
.
And
some
of
them
pretty
gone
on
her
at
that
.
''
All
the
time
Warren
was
talking
to
the
dried
old
package
of
Doctor
Dohmler
,
one
section
of
the
latter
's
mind
kept
thinking
intermittently
of
Chicago
.
Once
in
his
youth
he
could
have
gone
to
Chicago
as
fellow
and
docent
at
the
university
,
and
perhaps
become
rich
there
and
owned
his
own
clinic
instead
of
being
only
a
minor
shareholder
in
a
clinic
.
But
when
he
had
thought
of
what
he
considered
his
own
thin
knowledge
spread
over
that
whole
area
,
over
all
those
wheat
fields
,
those
endless
prairies
,
he
had
decided
against
it
.
But
he
had
read
about
Chicago
in
those
days
,
about
the
great
feudal
families
of
Armour
,
Palmer
,
Field
,
Crane
,
Warren
,
Swift
,
and
McCormick
and
many
others
,
and
since
that
time
not
a
few
patients
had
come
to
him
from
that
stratum
of
Chicago
and
New
York
.
``
She
got
worse
,
''
continued
Warren
.
``
She
had
a
fit
or
something
--
the
things
she
said
got
crazier
and
crazier
.
Her
sister
wrote
some
of
them
down
--
''
He
handed
a
much-folded
piece
of
paper
to
the
doctor
.
``
Almost
always
about
men
going
to
attack
her
,
men
she
knew
or
men
on
the
street
--
anybody
--
''
He
told
of
their
alarm
and
distress
,
of
the
horrors
families
go
through
under
such
circumstances
,
of
the
ineffectual
efforts
they
had
made
in
America
,
finally
of
the
faith
in
a
change
of
scene
that
had
made
him
run
the
submarine
blockade
and
bring
his
daughter
to
Switzerland.
``
--
on
a
United
States
cruiser
,
''
he
specified
with
a
touch
of
hauteur
.
``
It
was
possible
for
me
to
arrange
that
,
by
a
stroke
of
luck
.
And
,
may
I
add
,
''
he
smiled
apologetically
,
``
that
as
they
say
:
money
is
no
object
.
''
``
Certainly
not
,
''
agreed
Dohmler
dryly
.
He
was
wondering
why
and
about
what
the
man
was
lying
to
him
.
Or
,
if
he
was
wrong
about
that
,
what
was
the
falsity
that
pervaded
the
whole
room
,
the
handsome
figure
in
tweeds
sprawling
in
his
chair
with
a
sportsman
's
ease
?
That
was
a
tragedy
out
there
,
in
the
February
day
,
the
young
bird
with
wings
crushed
somehow
,
and
inside
here
it
was
all
too
thin
,
thin
and
wrong
.
``
I
would
like
--
to
talk
to
her
--
a
few
minutes
now
,
''
said
Doctor
Dohmler
,
going
into
English
as
if
it
would
bring
him
closer
to
Warren
.
Afterward
when
Warren
had
left
his
daughter
and
returned
to
Lausanne
,
and
several
days
had
passed
,
the
doctor
and
Franz
entered
upon
Nicole
's
card
:
Diagnostic
:
Schizophrénie
.
Phase
aiguë
en
décroissance
.
La
peur
des
hommes
est
un
symptôme
de
la
maladie
,
et
n'est
point
constitutionnelle
.
.
.
.
Le
pronostic
doit
rester
réservé
.
*
*
Diagnosis
:
Divided
Personality
.
Acute
and
down-hill
phase
of
the
illness
.
The
fear
of
men
is
a
symptom
of
the
illness
and
is
not
at
all
constitutional
.
.
.
.
The
prognosis
must
be
reserved
.
And
then
they
waited
with
increasing
interest
as
the
days
passed
for
Mr.
Warren
's
promised
second
visit
.
It
was
slow
in
coming
.
After
a
fortnight
Doctor
Dohmler
wrote
.
Confronted
with
further
silence
he
committed
what
was
for
those
days
``
une
folie
,
''
and
telephoned
to
the
Grand
Hotel
at
Vevey
.
He
learned
from
Mr.
Warren
's
valet
that
he
was
at
the
moment
packing
to
sail
for
America
.
But
reminded
that
the
forty
francs
Swiss
for
the
call
would
show
up
on
the
clinic
books
,
the
blood
of
the
Tuileries
Guard
rose
to
Doctor
Dohmler
's
aid
and
Mr.
Warren
was
got
to
the
phone
.
``
It
is
--
absolutely
necessary
--
that
you
come
.
Your
daughter
's
health
--
all
depends
.
I
can
take
no
responsibility
.
''
``
But
look
here
,
Doctor
,
that
's
just
what
you
're
for
.
I
have
a
hurry
call
to
go
home
!
''
Doctor
Dohmler
had
never
yet
spoken
to
any
one
so
far
away
but
he
dispatched
his
ultimatum
so
firmly
into
the
phone
that
the
agonized
American
at
the
other
end
yielded
.
Half
an
hour
after
this
second
arrival
on
the
Zurichsee
,
Warren
had
broken
down
,
his
fine
shoulders
shaking
with
awful
sobs
inside
his
easy
fitting
coat
,
his
eyes
redder
than
the
very
sun
on
Lake
Geneva
,
and
they
had
the
awful
story
.
``
It
just
happened
,
''
he
said
hoarsely
.
``
I
do
n't
know
--
I
do
n't
know
.
``
After
her
mother
died
when
she
was
little
she
used
to
come
into
my
bed
every
morning
,
sometimes
she
'd
sleep
in
my
bed
.
I
was
sorry
for
the
little
thing
.
Oh
,
after
that
,
whenever
we
went
places
in
an
automobile
or
a
train
we
used
to
hold
hands
.
She
used
to
sing
to
me
.
We
used
to
say
,
'Now
let
's
not
pay
any
attention
to
anybody
else
this
afternoon
--
let
's
just
have
each
other
--
for
this
morning
you
're
mine
.
'
''
A
broken
sarcasm
came
into
his
voice
.
``
People
used
to
say
what
a
wonderful
father
and
daughter
we
were
--
they
used
to
wipe
their
eyes
.
We
were
just
like
lovers
--
and
then
all
at
once
we
were
lovers
--
and
ten
minutes
after
it
happened
I
could
have
shot
myself
--
except
I
guess
I
'm
such
a
Goddamned
degenerate
I
did
n't
have
the
nerve
to
do
it
.
''
``
Then
what
?
''
said
Doctor
Dohmler
,
thinking
again
of
Chicago
and
of
a
mild
pale
gentleman
with
a
pince-nez
who
had
looked
him
over
in
Zurich
thirty
years
before
.
``
Did
this
thing
go
on
?
''
``
Oh
,
no
!
She
almost
--
she
seemed
to
freeze
up
right
away
.
She
'd
just
say
,
'Never
mind
,
never
mind
,
Daddy
.
It
does
n't
matter
.
Never
mind
.
'
''
``
There
were
no
consequences
?
''
``
No
.
''
He
gave
one
short
convulsive
sob
and
blew
his
nose
several
times
.
``
Except
now
there
're
plenty
of
consequences
.
''
As
the
story
concluded
Dohmler
sat
back
in
the
focal
armchair
of
the
middle
class
and
said
to
himself
sharply
,
``
Peasant
!
''
--
it
was
one
of
the
few
absolute
worldly
judgments
that
he
had
permitted
himself
for
twenty
years
.
Then
he
said
:
``
I
would
like
for
you
to
go
to
a
hotel
in
Zurich
and
spend
the
night
and
come
see
me
in
the
morning
.
''
``
And
then
what
?
''
Doctor
Dohmler
spread
his
hands
wide
enough
to
carry
a
young
pig
.
``
Chicago
,
''
he
suggested
.
IV
``
Then
we
knew
where
we
stood
,
''
said
Franz
.
``
Dohmler
told
Warren
we
would
take
the
case
if
he
would
agree
to
keep
away
from
his
daughter
indefinitely
,
with
an
absolute
minimum
of
five
years
.
After
Warren
's
first
collapse
,
he
seemed
chiefly
concerned
as
to
whether
the
story
would
ever
leak
back
to
America
.
''
``
We
mapped
out
a
routine
for
her
and
waited
.
The
prognosis
was
bad
--
as
you
know
,
the
percentage
of
cures
,
even
so-called
social
cures
,
is
very
low
at
that
age
.
''
``
Those
first
letters
looked
bad
,
''
agreed
Dick
.
``
Very
bad
--
very
typical
.
I
hesitated
about
letting
the
first
one
get
out
of
the
clinic
.
Then
I
thought
it
will
be
good
for
Dick
to
know
we
're
carrying
on
here
.
It
was
generous
of
you
to
answer
them
.
''
Dick
sighed
.
``
She
was
such
a
pretty
thing
--
she
enclosed
a
lot
of
snapshots
of
herself
.
And
for
a
month
there
I
did
n't
have
anything
to
do
.
All
I
said
in
my
letters
was
'Be
a
good
girl
and
mind
the
doctors
.
'
''
``
That
was
enough
--
it
gave
her
somebody
to
think
of
outside
.
For
a
while
she
did
n't
have
anybody
--
only
one
sister
that
she
does
n't
seem
very
close
to
.
Besides
,
reading
her
letters
helped
us
here
--
they
were
a
measure
of
her
condition
.
''
``
I
'm
glad
.
''
``
You
see
now
what
happened
?
She
felt
complicity
--
that
's
neither
here
nor
there
,
except
as
we
want
to
revalue
her
ultimate
stability
and
strength
of
character
.
First
came
this
shock
.
Then
she
went
off
to
a
boarding-school
and
heard
the
girls
talking
--
so
from
sheer
self-protection
she
developed
the
idea
that
she
had
had
no
complicity
--
and
from
there
it
was
easy
to
slide
into
a
phantom
world
where
all
men
,
the
more
you
liked
them
and
trusted
them
,
the
more
evil
--
''
``
Did
she
ever
go
into
the
--
horror
directly
?
''
``
No
,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
she
began
to
seem
normal
,
about
October
,
we
were
in
a
predicament
.
If
she
had
been
thirty
years
old
we
would
have
let
her
make
her
own
adjustment
,
but
she
was
so
young
we
were
afraid
she
might
harden
with
it
all
twisted
inside
her
.
So
Doctor
Dohmler
said
to
her
frankly
,
'Your
duty
now
is
to
yourself
.
This
does
n't
by
any
account
mean
the
end
of
anything
for
you
--
your
life
is
just
at
its
beginning
,
'
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
.
She
really
has
an
excellent
mind
,
so
he
gave
her
a
little
Freud
to
read
,
not
too
much
,
and
she
was
very
interested
.
In
fact
,
we
've
made
rather
a
pet
of
her
around
here
.
But
she
is
reticent
,
''
he
added
;
he
hesitated
:
``
We
have
wondered
if
in
her
recent
letters
to
you
which
she
mailed
herself
from
Zurich
,
she
has
said
anything
that
would
be
illuminating
about
her
state
of
mind
and
her
plans
for
the
future
.
''
Dick
considered
.
``
Yes
and
no
--
I
'll
bring
the
letters
out
here
if
you
want
.
She
seems
hopeful
and
normally
hungry
for
life
--
even
rather
romantic
.
Sometimes
she
speaks
of
'the
past
'
as
people
speak
who
have
been
in
prison
.
But
you
never
know
whether
they
refer
to
the
crime
or
the
imprisonment
or
the
whole
experience
.
After
all
I
'm
only
a
sort
of
stuffed
figure
in
her
life
.
''
``
Of
course
,
I
understand
your
position
exactly
,
and
I
express
our
gratitude
once
again
.
That
was
why
I
wanted
to
see
you
before
you
see
her
.
''
Dick
laughed
.
``
You
think
she
's
going
to
make
a
flying
leap
at
my
person
?
''
``
No
,
not
that
.
But
I
want
to
ask
you
to
go
very
gently
.
You
are
attractive
to
women
,
Dick
.
''
``
Then
God
help
me
!
Well
,
I
'll
be
gentle
and
repulsive
--
I
'll
chew
garlic
whenever
I
'm
going
to
see
her
and
wear
a
stubble
beard
.
I
'll
drive
her
to
cover
.
''
``
Not
garlic
!
''
said
Franz
,
taking
him
seriously
.
``
You
do
n't
want
to
compromise
your
career
.
But
you
're
partly
joking
.
''
``
--
and
I
can
limp
a
little
.
And
there
's
no
real
bathtub
where
I
'm
living
,
anyhow
.
''
``
You
're
entirely
joking
,
''
Franz
relaxed
--
or
rather
assumed
the
posture
of
one
relaxed
.
``
Now
tell
me
about
yourself
and
your
plans
?
''
``
I
've
only
got
one
,
Franz
,
and
that
's
to
be
a
good
psychologist
--
maybe
to
be
the
greatest
one
that
ever
lived
.
''
Franz
laughed
pleasantly
,
but
he
saw
that
this
time
Dick
was
n't
joking
.
``
That
's
very
good
--
and
very
American
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
more
difficult
for
us
.
''
He
got
up
and
went
to
the
French
window
.
``
I
stand
here
and
I
see
Zurich
--
there
is
the
steeple
of
the
Gross-Münster
.
In
its
vault
my
grandfather
is
buried
.
Across
the
bridge
from
it
lies
my
ancestor
Lavater
,
who
would
not
be
buried
in
any
church
.
Nearby
is
the
statue
of
another
ancestor
,
Heinrich
Pestalozzi
,
and
one
of
Doctor
Alfred
Escher
.
And
over
everything
there
is
always
Zwingli
--
I
am
continually
confronted
with
a
pantheon
of
heroes
.
''
``
Yes
,
I
see
.
''
Dick
got
up
.
``
I
was
only
talking
big
.
Everything
's
just
starting
over
.
Most
of
the
Americans
in
France
are
frantic
to
get
home
,
but
not
me
--
I
draw
military
pay
all
the
rest
of
the
year
if
I
only
attend
lectures
at
the
university
.
How
's
that
for
a
government
on
the
grand
scale
that
knows
its
future
great
men
?
Then
I
'm
going
home
for
a
month
and
see
my
father
.
Then
I
'm
coming
back
--
I
've
been
offered
a
job
.
''
``
Where
?
''
``
Your
rivals
--
Gisler
's
Clinic
on
Interlacken
.
''
``
Do
n't
touch
it
,
''
Franz
advised
him
.
``
They
've
had
a
dozen
young
men
there
in
a
year
.
Gisler
's
a
manic-depressive
himself
,
his
wife
and
her
lover
run
the
clinic
--
of
course
,
you
understand
that
's
confidential
.
''
``
How
about
your
old
scheme
for
America
?
''
asked
Dick
lightly
.
``
We
were
going
to
New
York
and
start
an
up-to-date
establishment
for
billionaires
.
''
``
That
was
students
'
talk
.
''
Dick
dined
with
Franz
and
his
bride
and
a
small
dog
with
a
smell
of
burning
rubber
,
in
their
cottage
on
the
edge
of
the
grounds
,
He
felt
vaguely
oppressed
,
not
by
the
atmosphere
of
modest
retrenchment
,
nor
by
Frau
Gregorovius
,
who
might
have
been
prophesied
,
but
by
the
sudden
contracting
of
horizons
to
which
Franz
seemed
so
reconciled
.
For
him
the
boundaries
of
asceticism
were
differently
marked
--
he
could
see
it
as
a
means
to
an
end
,
even
as
a
carrying
on
with
a
glory
it
would
itself
supply
,
but
it
was
hard
to
think
of
deliberately
cutting
life
down
to
the
scale
of
an
inherited
suit
.
The
domestic
gestures
of
Franz
and
his
wife
as
they
turned
in
a
cramped
space
lacked
grace
and
adventure
.
The
post-war
months
in
France
,
and
the
lavish
liquidations
taking
place
under
the
ægis
of
American
splendor
,
had
affected
Dick
's
outlook
.
Also
,
men
and
women
had
made
much
of
him
,
and
perhaps
what
had
brought
him
back
to
the
centre
of
the
great
Swiss
watch
,
was
an
intuition
that
this
was
not
too
good
for
a
serious
man
.
He
made
Kaethe
Gregorovius
feel
charming
,
meanwhile
becoming
increasingly
restless
at
the
all-pervading
cauliflower
--
simultaneously
hating
himself
too
for
this
incipience
of
he
knew
not
what
superficiality
.
``
God
,
am
I
like
the
rest
after
all
?
''
--
So
he
used
to
think
starting
awake
at
night
--
''
Am
I
like
the
rest
?
''
This
was
poor
material
for
a
socialist
but
good
material
for
those
who
do
much
of
the
world
's
rarest
work
.
The
truth
was
that
for
some
months
he
had
been
going
through
that
partitioning
of
the
things
of
youth
wherein
it
is
decided
whether
or
not
to
die
for
what
one
no
longer
believes
.
In
the
dead
white
hours
in
Zurich
staring
into
a
stranger
's
pantry
across
the
upshine
of
a
street-lamp
,
he
used
to
think
that
he
wanted
to
be
good
,
he
wanted
to
be
kind
,
he
wanted
to
be
brave
and
wise
,
but
it
was
all
pretty
difficult
.
He
wanted
to
be
loved
,
too
,
if
he
could
fit
it
in
.
V
The
veranda
of
the
central
building
was
illuminated
from
open
French
windows
,
save
where
the
black
shadows
of
stripling
walls
and
the
fantastic
shadows
of
iron
chairs
slithered
down
into
a
gladiola
bed
.
From
the
figures
that
shuffled
between
the
rooms
Miss
Warren
emerged
first
in
glimpses
and
then
sharply
when
she
saw
him
;
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
her
face
caught
the
room
's
last
light
and
brought
it
outside
with
her
.
She
walked
to
a
rhythm
--
all
that
week
there
had
been
singing
in
her
ears
,
summer
songs
of
ardent
skies
and
wild
shade
,
and
with
his
arrival
the
singing
had
become
so
loud
she
could
have
joined
in
with
it
.
``
How
do
you
do
,
Captain
,
''
she
said
,
unfastening
her
eyes
from
his
with
difficulty
,
as
though
they
had
become
entangled
.
``
Shall
we
sit
out
here
?
''
She
stood
still
,
her
glance
moving
about
for
a
moment
.
``
It
's
summer
practically
.
''
A
woman
had
followed
her
out
,
a
dumpy
woman
in
a
shawl
,
and
Nicole
presented
Dick
:
``
Señora
--
''
Franz
excused
himself
and
Dick
grouped
three
chairs
together
.
``
The
lovely
night
,
''
the
Señora
said
.
``
Muy
bella
,
''
agreed
Nicole
;
then
to
Dick
,
``
Are
you
here
for
a
long
time
?
''
``
I
'm
in
Zurich
for
a
long
time
,
if
that
's
what
you
mean
.
''
``
This
is
really
the
first
night
of
real
spring
,
''
the
Señora
suggested
.
``
To
stay
?
''
``
At
least
till
July
.
''
``
I
'm
leaving
in
June
.
''
``
June
is
a
lovely
month
here
,
''
the
Señora
commented
.
``
You
should
stay
for
June
and
then
leave
in
July
when
it
gets
really
too
hot
.
''
``
You
're
going
where
?
''
Dick
asked
Nicole
.
``
Somewhere
with
my
sister
--
somewhere
exciting
,
I
hope
,
because
I
've
lost
so
much
time
.
But
perhaps
they
'll
think
I
ought
to
go
to
a
quiet
place
at
first
--
perhaps
Como
.
Why
do
n't
you
come
to
Como
?
''
``
Ah
,
Como
--
''
began
the
Señora
.
Within
the
building
a
trio
broke
into
Suppe
's
``
Light
Cavalry
.
''
Nicole
took
advantage
of
this
to
stand
up
and
the
impression
of
her
youth
and
beauty
grew
on
Dick
until
it
welled
up
inside
him
in
a
compact
paroxysm
of
emotion
.
She
smiled
,
a
moving
childish
smile
that
was
like
all
the
lost
youth
in
the
world
.
``
The
music
's
too
loud
to
talk
against
--
suppose
we
walk
around
.
Buenas
noches
,
Señora
.
''
``
G't
night
--
g't
night
.
''
They
went
down
two
steps
to
the
path
--
where
in
a
moment
a
shadow
cut
across
it
.
She
took
his
arm
.
``
I
have
some
phonograph
records
my
sister
sent
me
from
America
,
''
she
said
.
``
Next
time
you
come
here
I
'll
play
them
for
you
--
I
know
a
place
to
put
the
phonograph
where
no
one
can
hear
.
''
``
That
'll
be
nice
.
''
``
Do
you
know
'Hindustan
'
?
''
she
asked
wistfully
.
``
I
'd
never
heard
it
before
,
but
I
like
it
.
And
I
've
got
'Why
Do
They
Call
Them
Babies
?
'
and
'I
'm
Glad
I
Can
Make
You
Cry
.
'
I
suppose
you
've
danced
to
all
those
tunes
in
Paris
?
''
``
I
have
n't
been
to
Paris
.
''
Her
cream-colored
dress
,
alternately
blue
or
gray
as
they
walked
,
and
her
very
blonde
hair
,
dazzled
Dick
--
whenever
he
turned
toward
her
she
was
smiling
a
little
,
her
face
lighting
up
like
an
angel
's
when
they
came
into
the
range
of
a
roadside
arc
.
She
thanked
him
for
everything
,
rather
as
if
he
had
taken
her
to
some
party
,
and
as
Dick
became
less
and
less
certain
of
his
relation
to
her
,
her
confidence
increased
--
there
was
that
excitement
about
her
that
seemed
to
reflect
all
the
excitement
of
the
world
.
``
I
'm
not
under
any
restraint
at
all
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'll
play
you
two
good
tunes
called
'Wait
Till
the
Cows
Come
Home
'
and
'Good-by
,
Alexander
.
'
''
He
was
late
the
next
time
,
a
week
later
,
and
Nicole
was
waiting
for
him
at
a
point
in
the
path
which
he
would
pass
walking
from
Franz
's
house
.
Her
hair
drawn
back
of
her
ears
brushed
her
shoulders
in
such
a
way
that
the
face
seemed
to
have
just
emerged
from
it
,
as
if
this
were
the
exact
moment
when
she
was
coming
from
a
wood
into
clear
moonlight
.
The
unknown
yielded
her
up
;
Dick
wished
she
had
no
background
,
that
she
was
just
a
girl
lost
with
no
address
save
the
night
from
which
she
had
come
.
They
went
to
the
cache
where
she
had
left
the
phonograph
,
turned
a
corner
by
the
workshop
,
climbed
a
rock
,
and
sat
down
behind
a
low
wall
,
facing
miles
and
miles
of
rolling
night
.
They
were
in
America
now
,
even
Franz
with
his
conception
of
Dick
as
an
irresistible
Lothario
would
never
have
guessed
that
they
had
gone
so
far
away
.
They
were
so
sorry
,
dear
;
they
went
down
to
meet
each
other
in
a
taxi
,
honey
;
they
had
preferences
in
smiles
and
had
met
in
Hindustan
,
and
shortly
afterward
they
must
have
quarrelled
,
for
nobody
knew
and
nobody
seemed
to
care
--
yet
finally
one
of
them
had
gone
and
left
the
other
crying
,
only
to
feel
blue
,
to
feel
sad
.
The
thin
tunes
,
holding
lost
times
and
future
hopes
in
liaison
,
twisted
upon
the
Valais
night
.
In
the
lulls
of
the
phonograph
a
cricket
held
the
scene
together
with
a
single
note
.
By
and
by
Nicole
stopped
playing
the
machine
and
sang
to
him
.
``
Lay
a
silver
dollar
On
the
ground
And
watch
it
roll
Because
it
's
round
--
''
On
the
pure
parting
of
her
lips
no
breath
hovered
.
Dick
stood
up
suddenly
.
``
What
's
the
matter
,
you
do
n't
like
it
?
''
``
Of
course
I
do
.
''
``
Our
cook
at
home
taught
it
to
me
:
``
A
woman
never
knows
What
a
good
man
she
's
got
Till
after
she
turns
him
down
.
.
.
''
``
You
like
it
?
''
She
smiled
at
him
,
making
sure
that
the
smile
gathered
up
everything
inside
her
and
directed
it
toward
him
,
making
him
a
profound
promise
of
herself
for
so
little
,
for
the
beat
of
a
response
,
the
assurance
of
a
complimentary
vibration
in
him
.
Minute
by
minute
the
sweetness
drained
down
into
her
out
of
the
willow
trees
,
out
of
the
dark
world
.
She
stood
up
too
,
and
stumbling
over
the
phonograph
,
was
momentarily
against
him
,
leaning
into
the
hollow
of
his
rounded
shoulder
.
``
I
've
got
one
more
record
,
''
she
said.
``
--
Have
you
heard
'So
Long
,
Letty
'
?
I
suppose
you
have
.
''
``
Honestly
,
you
do
n't
understand
--
I
have
n't
heard
a
thing
.
''
Nor
known
,
nor
smelt
,
nor
tasted
,
he
might
have
added
;
only
hot-cheeked
girls
in
hot
secret
rooms
.
The
young
maidens
he
had
known
at
New
Haven
in
1914
kissed
men
,
saying
``
There
!
``
,
hands
at
the
man
's
chest
to
push
him
away
.
Now
there
was
this
scarcely
saved
waif
of
disaster
bringing
him
the
essence
of
a
continent
.
.
.
.
VI
It
was
May
when
he
next
found
her
.
The
luncheon
in
Zurich
was
a
council
of
caution
;
obviously
the
logic
of
his
life
tended
away
from
the
girl
;
yet
when
a
stranger
stared
at
her
from
a
nearby
table
,
eyes
burning
disturbingly
like
an
uncharted
light
,
he
turned
to
the
man
with
an
urbane
version
of
intimidation
and
broke
the
regard
.
``
He
was
just
a
peeper
,
''
he
explained
cheerfully
.
``
He
was
just
looking
at
your
clothes
.
Why
do
you
have
so
many
different
clothes
?
''
``
Sister
says
we
're
very
rich
,
''
she
offered
humbly
.
``
Since
Grandmother
is
dead
.
''
``
I
forgive
you
.
''
He
was
enough
older
than
Nicole
to
take
pleasure
in
her
youthful
vanities
and
delights
,
the
way
she
paused
fractionally
in
front
of
the
hall
mirror
on
leaving
the
restaurant
,
so
that
the
incorruptible
quicksilver
could
give
her
back
to
herself
.
He
delighted
in
her
stretching
out
her
hands
to
new
octaves
now
that
she
found
herself
beautiful
and
rich
.
He
tried
honestly
to
divorce
her
from
any
obsession
that
he
had
stitched
her
together
--
glad
to
see
her
build
up
happiness
and
confidence
apart
from
him
;
the
difficulty
was
that
,
eventually
,
Nicole
brought
everything
to
his
feet
,
gifts
of
sacrificial
ambrosia
,
of
worshipping
myrtle
.
The
first
week
of
summer
found
Dick
re-established
in
Zurich
.
He
had
arranged
his
pamphlets
and
what
work
he
had
done
in
the
Service
into
a
pattern
from
which
he
intended
to
make
his
revise
of
``
A
Psychology
for
Psychiatrists
.
''
He
thought
he
had
a
publisher
;
he
had
established
contact
with
a
poor
student
who
would
iron
out
his
errors
in
German
.
Franz
considered
it
a
rash
business
,
but
Dick
pointed
out
the
disarming
modesty
of
the
theme
.
``
This
is
stuff
I
'll
never
know
so
well
again
,
''
he
insisted
.
``
I
have
a
hunch
it
's
a
thing
that
only
fails
to
be
basic
because
it
's
never
had
material
recognition
.
The
weakness
of
this
profession
is
its
attraction
for
the
man
a
little
crippled
and
broken
.
Within
the
walls
of
the
profession
he
compensates
by
tending
toward
the
clinical
,
the
'practical
'
--
he
has
won
his
battle
without
a
struggle
.
``
On
the
contrary
,
you
are
a
good
man
,
Franz
,
because
fate
selected
you
for
your
profession
before
you
were
born
.
You
better
thank
God
you
had
no
'bent
'
--
I
got
to
be
a
psychiatrist
because
there
was
a
girl
at
St.
Hilda
's
in
Oxford
that
went
to
the
same
lectures
.
Maybe
I
'm
getting
trite
but
I
do
n't
want
to
let
my
current
ideas
slide
away
with
a
few
dozen
glasses
of
beer
.
''
``
All
right
,
''
Franz
answered
.
``
You
are
an
American
.
You
can
do
this
without
professional
harm
.
I
do
not
like
these
generalities
.
Soon
you
will
be
writing
little
books
called
'Deep
Thoughts
for
the
Layman
,
'
so
simplified
that
they
are
positively
guaranteed
not
to
cause
thinking
.
If
my
father
were
alive
he
would
look
at
you
and
grunt
,
Dick
.
He
would
take
his
napkin
and
fold
it
so
,
and
hold
his
napkin
ring
,
this
very
one
--
''
he
held
it
up
,
a
boar
's
head
was
carved
in
the
brown
wood
--
''
and
he
would
say
,
'Well
my
impression
is
--
'
then
he
would
look
at
you
and
think
suddenly
'What
is
the
use
?
'
then
he
would
stop
and
grunt
again
;
then
we
would
be
at
the
end
of
dinner
.
''
``
I
am
alone
to-day
,
''
said
Dick
testily
.
``
But
I
may
not
be
alone
to-morrow
.
After
that
I
'll
fold
up
my
napkin
like
your
father
and
grunt
.
''
Franz
waited
a
moment
.
``
How
about
our
patient
?
''
he
asked
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
``
Well
,
you
should
know
about
her
by
now
.
''
``
I
like
her
.
She
's
attractive
.
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
--
take
her
up
in
the
edelweiss
?
''
``
No
,
I
thought
since
you
go
in
for
scientific
books
you
might
have
an
idea
.
''
``
--
devote
my
life
to
her
?
''
Franz
called
his
wife
in
the
kitchen
:
``
Du
lieber
Gott
!
Bitte
,
bringe
Dick
noch
ein
Glas-Bier
.
''
``
I
do
n't
want
any
more
if
I
've
got
to
see
Dohmler
.
''
``
We
think
it
's
best
to
have
a
program
.
Four
weeks
have
passed
away
--
apparently
the
girl
is
in
love
with
you
.
That
's
not
our
business
if
we
were
in
the
world
,
but
here
in
the
clinic
we
have
a
stake
in
the
matter
.
''
``
I
'll
do
whatever
Doctor
Dohmler
says
,
''
Dick
agreed
.
But
he
had
little
faith
that
Dohmler
would
throw
much
light
on
the
matter
;
he
himself
was
the
incalculable
element
involved
.
By
no
conscious
volition
of
his
own
,
the
thing
had
drifted
into
his
hands
.
It
reminded
him
of
a
scene
in
his
childhood
when
everyone
in
the
house
was
looking
for
the
lost
key
to
the
silver
closet
,
Dick
knowing
he
had
hid
it
under
the
handkerchiefs
in
his
mother
's
top
drawer
;
at
that
time
he
had
experienced
a
philosophical
detachment
,
and
this
was
repeated
now
when
he
and
Franz
went
together
to
Professor
Dohmler
's
office
.
The
professor
,
his
face
beautiful
under
straight
whiskers
,
like
a
vine-overgrown
veranda
of
some
fine
old
house
,
disarmed
him
.
Dick
knew
some
individuals
with
more
talent
,
but
no
person
of
a
class
qualitatively
superior
to
Dohmler
.
--
Six
months
later
he
thought
the
same
way
when
he
saw
Dohmler
dead
,
the
light
out
on
the
veranda
,
the
vines
of
his
whiskers
tickling
his
stiff
white
collar
,
the
many
battles
that
had
swayed
before
the
chink-like
eyes
stilled
forever
under
the
frail
delicate
lids
--
``
.
.
.
Good
morning
,
sir
.
''
He
stood
formally
,
thrown
back
to
the
army
.
Professor
Dohmler
interlaced
his
tranquil
fingers
.
Franz
spoke
in
terms
half
of
liaison
officer
,
half
of
secretary
,
till
his
senior
cut
through
him
in
mid-sentence
.
``
We
have
gone
a
certain
way
,
''
he
said
mildly
.
``
It
's
you
,
Doctor
Diver
,
who
can
best
help
us
now
.
''
Routed
out
,
Dick
confessed
:
``
I
'm
not
so
straight
on
it
myself
.
''
``
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
your
personal
reactions
,
''
said
Dohmler
.
``
But
I
have
much
to
do
with
the
fact
that
this
so-called
'transference
,
'
''
he
darted
a
short
ironic
look
at
Franz
which
the
latter
returned
in
kind
,
``
must
be
terminated
.
Miss
Nicole
does
well
indeed
,
but
she
is
in
no
condition
to
survive
what
she
might
interpret
as
a
tragedy
.
''
Again
Franz
began
to
speak
,
but
Doctor
Dohmler
motioned
him
silent
.
``
I
realize
that
your
position
has
been
difficult
.
''
``
Yes
,
it
has
.
''
Now
the
professor
sat
back
and
laughed
,
saying
on
the
last
syllable
of
his
laughter
,
with
his
sharp
little
gray
eyes
shining
through
:
``
Perhaps
you
have
got
sentimentally
involved
yourself
.
''
Aware
that
he
was
being
drawn
on
,
Dick
,
too
,
laughed
.
``
She
's
a
pretty
girl
--
anybody
responds
to
that
to
a
certain
extent
.
I
have
no
intention
--
''
Again
Franz
tried
to
speak
--
again
Dohmler
stopped
him
with
a
question
directed
pointedly
at
Dick
.
``
Have
you
thought
of
going
away
?
''
``
I
ca
n't
go
away
.
''
Doctor
Dohmler
turned
to
Franz
:
``
Then
we
can
send
Miss
Warren
away
.
''
``
As
you
think
best
,
Professor
Dohmler
,
''
Dick
conceded
.
``
It
's
certainly
a
situation
.
''
Professor
Dohmler
raised
himself
like
a
legless
man
mounting
a
pair
of
crutches
.
``
But
it
is
a
professional
situation
,
''
he
cried
quietly
.
He
sighed
himself
back
into
his
chair
,
waiting
for
the
reverberating
thunder
to
die
out
about
the
room
.
Dick
saw
that
Dohmler
had
reached
his
climax
,
and
he
was
not
sure
that
he
himself
had
survived
it
.
When
the
thunder
had
diminished
Franz
managed
to
get
his
word
in
.
``
Doctor
Diver
is
a
man
of
fine
character
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
feel
he
only
has
to
appreciate
the
situation
in
order
to
deal
correctly
with
it
.
In
my
opinion
Dick
can
co-operate
right
here
,
without
any
one
going
away
.
''
``
How
do
you
feel
about
that
?
''
Professor
Dohmler
asked
Dick
.
Dick
felt
churlish
in
the
face
of
the
situation
;
at
the
same
time
he
realized
in
the
silence
after
Dohmler
's
pronouncement
that
the
state
of
inanimation
could
not
be
indefinitely
prolonged
;
suddenly
he
spilled
everything
.
``
I
'm
half
in
love
with
her
--
the
question
of
marrying
her
has
passed
through
my
mind
.
''
``
Tch
!
Tch
!
''
uttered
Franz
.
``
Wait
.
''
Dohmler
warned
him
.
Franz
refused
to
wait
:
``
What
!
And
devote
half
your
life
to
being
doctor
and
nurse
and
all
--
never
!
I
know
what
these
cases
are
.
One
time
in
twenty
it
's
finished
in
the
first
push
--
better
never
see
her
again
!
''
``
What
do
you
think
?
''
Dohmler
asked
Dick
.
``
Of
course
Franz
is
right
.
''
VII
It
was
late
afternoon
when
they
wound
up
the
discussion
as
to
what
Dick
should
do
,
he
must
be
most
kind
and
yet
eliminate
himself
.
When
the
doctors
stood
up
at
last
,
Dick
's
eyes
fell
outside
the
window
to
where
a
light
rain
was
falling
--
Nicole
was
waiting
,
expectant
,
somewhere
in
that
rain
.
When
,
presently
,
he
went
out
buttoning
his
oil-skin
at
the
throat
,
pulling
down
the
brim
of
his
hat
,
he
came
upon
her
immediately
under
the
roof
of
the
main
entrance
.
``
I
know
a
new
place
we
can
go
,
''
she
said
.
``
When
I
was
ill
I
did
n't
mind
sitting
inside
with
the
others
in
the
evening
--
what
they
said
seemed
like
everything
else
.
Naturally
now
I
see
them
as
ill
and
it
's
--
it
's
--
''
``
You
'll
be
leaving
soon
.
''
``
Oh
,
soon
.
My
sister
,
Beth
,
but
she
's
always
been
called
Baby
,
she
's
coming
in
a
few
weeks
to
take
me
somewhere
;
after
that
I
'll
be
back
here
for
a
last
month
.
''
``
The
older
sister
?
''
``
Oh
,
quite
a
bit
older
.
She
's
twenty-four
--
she
's
very
English
.
She
lives
in
London
with
my
father
's
sister
.
She
was
engaged
to
an
Englishman
but
he
was
killed
--
I
never
saw
him
.
''
Her
face
,
ivory
gold
against
the
blurred
sunset
that
strove
through
the
rain
,
had
a
promise
Dick
had
never
seen
before
:
the
high
cheek-bones
,
the
faintly
wan
quality
,
cool
rather
than
feverish
,
was
reminiscent
of
the
frame
of
a
promising
colt
--
a
creature
whose
life
did
not
promise
to
be
only
a
projection
of
youth
upon
a
grayer
screen
,
but
instead
,
a
true
growing
;
the
face
would
be
handsome
in
middle
life
;
it
would
be
handsome
in
old
age
:
the
essential
structure
and
the
economy
were
there
.
``
What
are
you
looking
at
?
''
``
I
was
just
thinking
that
you
're
going
to
be
rather
happy
.
''
Nicole
was
frightened
:
``
Am
I
?
All
right
--
things
could
n't
be
worse
than
they
have
been
.
''
In
the
covered
woodshed
to
which
she
had
led
him
,
she
sat
cross-legged
upon
her
golf
shoes
,
her
burberry
wound
about
her
and
her
cheeks
stung
alive
by
the
damp
air
.
Gravely
she
returned
his
gaze
,
taking
in
his
somewhat
proud
carriage
that
never
quite
yielded
to
the
wooden
post
against
which
he
leaned
;
she
looked
into
his
face
that
always
tried
to
discipline
itself
into
molds
of
attentive
seriousness
,
after
excursions
into
joys
and
mockeries
of
its
own
.
That
part
of
him
which
seemed
to
fit
his
reddish
Irish
coloring
she
knew
least
;
she
was
afraid
of
it
,
yet
more
anxious
to
explore
--
this
was
his
more
masculine
side
:
the
other
part
,
the
trained
part
,
the
consideration
in
the
polite
eyes
,
she
expropriated
without
question
,
as
most
women
did
.
``
At
least
this
institution
has
been
good
for
languages
,
''
said
Nicole
.
``
I
've
spoken
French
with
two
doctors
,
and
German
with
the
nurses
,
and
Italian
,
or
something
like
it
,
with
a
couple
of
scrub-women
and
one
of
the
patients
,
and
I
've
picked
up
a
lot
of
Spanish
from
another
.
''
``
That
's
fine
.
''
He
tried
to
arrange
an
attitude
but
no
logic
seemed
forthcoming.
``
--
Music
too
.
Hope
you
did
n't
think
I
was
only
interested
in
ragtime
.
I
practise
every
day
--
the
last
few
months
I
've
been
taking
a
course
in
Zurich
on
the
history
of
music
.
In
fact
it
was
all
that
kept
me
going
at
times
--
music
and
the
drawing
.
''
She
leaned
suddenly
and
twisted
a
loose
strip
from
the
sole
of
her
shoe
and
then
looked
up
.
``
I
'd
like
to
draw
you
just
the
way
you
are
now
.
''
It
made
him
sad
when
she
brought
out
her
accomplishments
for
his
approval
.
``
I
envy
you
.
At
present
I
do
n't
seem
to
be
interested
in
anything
except
my
work
.
''
``
Oh
,
I
think
that
's
fine
for
a
man
,
''
she
said
quickly
.
``
But
for
a
girl
I
think
she
ought
to
have
lots
of
minor
accomplishments
and
pass
them
on
to
her
children
.
''
``
I
suppose
so
,
''
said
Dick
with
deliberated
indifference
.
Nicole
sat
quiet
.
Dick
wished
she
would
speak
so
that
he
could
play
the
easy
rôle
of
wet
blanket
,
but
now
she
sat
quiet
.
``
You
're
all
well
,
''
he
said
.
``
Try
to
forget
the
past
;
do
n't
overdo
things
for
a
year
or
so
.
Go
back
to
America
and
be
a
débutante
and
fall
in
love
--
and
be
happy
.
''
``
I
could
n't
fall
in
love
.
''
Her
injured
shoe
scraped
a
cocoon
of
dust
from
the
log
on
which
she
sat
.
``
Sure
you
can
,
''
Dick
insisted
.
``
Not
for
a
year
maybe
,
but
sooner
or
later
.
''
Then
he
added
brutally
:
``
You
can
have
a
perfectly
normal
life
with
a
houseful
of
beautiful
descendants
.
The
very
fact
that
you
could
make
a
complete
comeback
at
your
age
proves
that
the
precipitating
factors
were
pretty
near
everything
.
Young
woman
,
you
'll
be
pulling
your
weight
long
after
your
friends
are
carried
off
screaming
.
''
--
But
there
was
a
look
of
pain
in
her
eyes
as
she
took
the
rough
dose
,
the
harsh
reminder
.
``
I
know
I
would
n't
be
fit
to
marry
any
one
for
a
long
time
,
''
she
said
humbly
.
Dick
was
too
upset
to
say
any
more
.
He
looked
out
into
the
grain
field
trying
to
recover
his
hard
brassy
attitude
.
``
You
'll
be
all
right
--
everybody
here
believes
in
you
.
Why
,
Doctor
Gregory
is
so
proud
of
you
that
he
'll
probably
--
''
``
I
hate
Doctor
Gregory
.
''
``
Well
,
you
should
n't
.
''
Nicole
's
world
had
fallen
to
pieces
,
but
it
was
only
a
flimsy
and
scarcely
created
world
;
beneath
it
her
emotions
and
instincts
fought
on
.
Was
it
an
hour
ago
she
had
waited
by
the
entrance
,
wearing
her
hope
like
a
corsage
at
her
belt
?
.
.
.
Dress
stay
crisp
for
him
,
button
stay
put
,
bloom
narcissus
--
air
stay
still
and
sweet
.
``
It
will
be
nice
to
have
fun
again
,
''
she
fumbled
on
.
For
a
moment
she
entertained
a
desperate
idea
of
telling
him
how
rich
she
was
,
what
big
houses
she
lived
in
,
that
really
she
was
a
valuable
property
--
for
a
moment
she
made
herself
into
her
grandfather
,
Sid
Warren
,
the
horse-trader
.
But
she
survived
the
temptation
to
confuse
all
values
and
shut
these
matters
into
their
Victorian
side-chambers
--
even
though
there
was
no
home
left
to
her
,
save
emptiness
and
pain
.
``
I
have
to
go
back
to
the
clinic
.
It
's
not
raining
now
.
''
Dick
walked
beside
her
,
feeling
her
unhappiness
,
and
wanting
to
drink
the
rain
that
touched
her
cheek
.
``
I
have
some
new
records
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
can
hardly
wait
to
play
them
.
Do
you
know
--
''
After
supper
that
evening
,
Dick
thought
,
he
would
finish
the
break
;
also
he
wanted
to
kick
Franz
's
bottom
for
having
partially
introduced
him
to
such
a
sordid
business
.
He
waited
in
the
hall
.
His
eyes
followed
a
beret
,
not
wet
with
waiting
like
Nicole
's
beret
,
but
covering
a
skull
recently
operated
on
.
Beneath
it
human
eyes
peered
,
found
him
and
came
over
:
``
Bonjour
,
Docteur
.
''
``
Bonjour
,
Monsieur
.
''
``
Il
fait
beau
temps
.
''
``
Oui
,
merveilleux
.
''
``
Vous
êtes
ici
maintenant
?
''
``
Non
,
pour
la
journée
seulement
.
''
``
Ah
,
bon
.
Alors
--
au
revoir
,
Monsieur
.
''
Glad
at
having
survived
another
contact
,
the
wretch
in
the
beret
moved
away
.
Dick
waited
.
Presently
a
nurse
came
downstairs
and
delivered
him
a
message
.
``
Miss
Warren
asks
to
be
excused
,
Doctor
.
She
wants
to
lie
down
.
She
wants
to
have
dinner
upstairs
to-night
.
''
The
nurse
hung
on
his
response
,
half
expecting
him
to
imply
that
Miss
Warren
's
attitude
was
pathological
.
``
Oh
,
I
see
.
Well
--
''
He
rearranged
the
flow
of
his
own
saliva
,
the
pulse
of
his
heart
.
``
I
hope
she
feels
better
.
Thanks
.
''
He
was
puzzled
and
discontent
.
At
any
rate
it
freed
him
.
Leaving
a
note
for
Franz
begging
off
from
supper
,
he
walked
through
the
countryside
to
the
tram
station
.
As
he
reached
the
platform
,
with
spring
twilight
gilding
the
rails
and
the
glass
in
the
slot
machines
,
he
began
to
feel
that
the
station
,
the
hospital
,
was
hovering
between
being
centripetal
and
centrifugal
.
He
felt
frightened
.
He
was
glad
when
the
substantial
cobble-stones
of
Zurich
clicked
once
more
under
his
shoes
.
He
expected
to
hear
from
Nicole
next
day
but
there
was
no
word
.
Wondering
if
she
was
ill
,
he
called
the
clinic
and
talked
to
Franz
.
``
She
came
downstairs
to
luncheon
yesterday
and
to-day
,
''
said
Franz
.
``
She
seemed
a
little
abstracted
and
in
the
clouds
.
How
did
it
go
off
?
''
Dick
tried
to
plunge
over
the
Alpine
crevasse
between
the
sexes
.
``
We
did
n't
get
to
it
--
at
least
I
did
n't
think
we
did
.
I
tried
to
be
distant
,
but
I
did
n't
think
enough
happened
to
change
her
attitude
if
it
ever
went
deep
.
''
Perhaps
his
vanity
had
been
hurt
that
there
was
no
coup
de
grâce
to
administer
.
``
From
some
things
she
said
to
her
nurse
I
'm
inclined
to
think
she
understood
.
''
``
All
right
.
''
``
It
was
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
.
She
does
n't
seem
over-agitated
--
only
a
little
in
the
clouds
.
''
``
All
right
,
then
.
''
``
Dick
,
come
soon
and
see
me
.
''
VIII
During
the
next
weeks
Dick
experienced
a
vast
dissatisfaction
.
The
pathological
origin
and
mechanistic
defeat
of
the
affair
left
a
flat
and
metallic
taste
.
Nicole
's
emotions
had
been
used
unfairly
--
what
if
they
turned
out
to
have
been
his
own
?
Necessarily
he
must
absent
himself
from
felicity
a
while
--
in
dreams
he
saw
her
walking
on
the
clinic
path
swinging
her
wide
straw
hat
.
.
.
.
One
time
he
saw
her
in
person
;
as
he
walked
past
the
Palace
Hotel
,
a
magnificent
Rolls
curved
into
the
half-moon
entrance
.
Small
within
its
gigantic
proportions
,
and
buoyed
up
by
the
power
of
a
hundred
superfluous
horses
,
sat
Nicole
and
a
young
woman
whom
he
assumed
was
her
sister
.
Nicole
saw
him
and
momentarily
her
lips
parted
in
an
expression
of
fright
.
Dick
shifted
his
hat
and
passed
,
yet
for
a
moment
the
air
around
him
was
loud
with
the
circlings
of
all
the
goblins
on
the
Gross-Münster
.
He
tried
to
write
the
matter
out
of
his
mind
in
a
memorandum
that
went
into
detail
as
to
the
solemn
régime
before
her
;
the
possibilities
of
another
``
push
''
of
the
malady
under
the
stresses
which
the
world
would
inevitably
supply
--
in
all
a
memorandum
that
would
have
been
convincing
to
any
one
save
to
him
who
had
written
it
.
The
total
value
of
this
effort
was
to
make
him
realize
once
more
how
far
his
emotions
were
involved
;
thenceforth
he
resolutely
provided
antidotes
.
One
was
the
telephone
girl
from
Bar-sur-Aube
,
now
touring
Europe
from
Nice
to
Coblenz
,
in
a
desperate
roundup
of
the
men
she
had
known
in
her
never-to-be-equalled
holiday
;
another
was
the
making
of
arrangements
to
get
home
on
a
government
transport
in
August
;
a
third
was
a
consequent
intensification
of
work
on
his
proofs
for
the
book
that
this
autumn
was
to
be
presented
to
the
German-speaking
world
of
psychiatry
.
Dick
had
outgrown
the
book
;
he
wanted
now
to
do
more
spade
work
;
if
he
got
an
exchange
fellowship
he
could
count
on
plenty
of
routine
.
Meanwhile
he
had
projected
a
new
work
:
An
Attempt
at
a
Uniform
and
Pragmatic
Classification
of
the
Neuroses
and
Psychoses
,
Based
on
an
Examination
of
Fifteen
Hundred
Pre-Krapælin
and
Post-Krapælin
Cases
as
they
would
be
Diagnosed
in
the
Terminology
of
the
Different
Contemporary
Schools
--
and
another
sonorous
paragraph
--
Together
with
a
Chronology
of
Such
Subdivisions
of
Opinion
as
Have
Arisen
Independently
.
This
title
would
look
monumental
in
German
.
*
*Ein

Neurosen
und

und
pragmatisch
zu
klassifizieren
auf
Grund
der
Untersuchung
von

und
post-Krapaelin
Fällen
wie

in

von

Schulen

Gegenwart
--
and
another
sonorous
paragraph
--
Zusammen

Going
into
Montreux
Dick
pedalled
slowly
,
gaping
at
the
Jugenhorn
whenever
possible
,
and
blinded
by
glimpses
of
the
lake
through
the
alleys
of
the
shore
hotels
.
He
was
conscious
of
the
groups
of
English
,
emergent
after
four
years
and
walking
with
detective-story
suspicion
in
their
eyes
,
as
though
they
were
about
to
be
assaulted
in
this
questionable
country
by
German
trained-bands
.
There
were
building
and
awakening
everywhere
on
this
mound
of
débris
formed
by
a
mountain
torrent
.
At
Berne
and
at
Lausanne
on
the
way
south
,
Dick
had
been
eagerly
asked
if
there
would
be
Americans
this
year
.
``
By
August
,
if
not
in
June
?
''
He
wore
leather
shorts
,
an
army
shirt
,
mountain
shoes
.
In
his
knapsack
were
a
cotton
suit
and
a
change
of
underwear
.
At
the
Glion
funicular
he
checked
his
bicycle
and
took
a
small
beer
on
the
terrace
of
the
station
buffet
,
meanwhile
watching
the
little
bug
crawl
down
the
eighty-degree
slope
of
the
hill
.
His
ear
was
full
of
dried
blood
from
La
Tour
de
Pelz
,
where
he
had
sprinted
under
the
impression
that
he
was
a
spoiled
athlete
.
He
asked
for
alcohol
and
cleared
up
the
exterior
while
the
funicular
slid
down
port
.
He
saw
his
bicycle
embarked
,
slung
his
knapsack
into
the
lower
compartment
of
the
car
,
and
followed
it
in
.
Mountain-climbing
cars
are
built
on
a
slant
similar
to
the
angle
of
a
hat-brim
of
a
man
who
does
n't
want
to
be
recognized
.
As
water
gushed
from
the
chamber
under
the
car
,
Dick
was
impressed
with
the
ingenuity
of
the
whole
idea
--
a
complimentary
car
was
now
taking
on
mountain
water
at
the
top
and
would
pull
the
lightened
car
up
by
gravity
,
as
soon
as
the
brakes
were
released
.
It
must
have
been
a
great
inspiration
.
In
the
seat
across
,
a
couple
of
British
were
discussing
the
cable
itself
.
``
The
ones
made
in
England
always
last
five
or
six
years
.
Two
years
ago
the
Germans
underbid
us
,
and
how
long
do
you
think
their
cable
lasted
?
''
``
How
long
?
''
``
A
year
and
ten
months
.
Then
the
Swiss
sold
it
to
the
Italians
.
They
do
n't
have
rigid
inspections
of
cables
.
''
``
I
can
see
it
would
be
a
terrible
thing
for
Switzerland
if
a
cable
broke
.
''
The
conductor
shut
a
door
;
he
telephoned
his
confrere
among
the
undulati
,
and
with
a
jerk
the
car
was
pulled
upward
,
heading
for
a
pinpoint
on
an
emerald
hill
above
.
After
it
cleared
the
low
roofs
,
the
skies
of
Vaud
,
Valais
,
Swiss
Savoy
,
and
Geneva
spread
around
the
passengers
in
cyclorama
.
On
the
centre
of
the
lake
,
cooled
by
the
piercing
current
of
the
Rhône
,
lay
the
true
centre
of
the
Western
World
.
Upon
it
floated
swans
like
boats
and
boats
like
swans
,
both
lost
in
the
nothingness
of
the
heartless
beauty
.
It
was
a
bright
day
,
with
sun
glittering
on
the
grass
beach
below
and
the
white
courts
of
the
Kursal
.
The
figures
on
the
courts
threw
no
shadows
.
When
Chillon
and
the
island
palace
of
Salagnon
came
into
view
Dick
turned
his
eyes
inward
.
The
funicular
was
above
the
highest
houses
of
the
shore
;
on
both
sides
a
tangle
of
foliage
and
flowers
culminated
at
intervals
in
masses
of
color
.
It
was
a
rail-side
garden
,
and
in
the
car
was
a
sign
:
Défense
de
cueillir
les
fleurs
.
Though
one
must
not
pick
flowers
on
the
way
up
,
the
blossoms
trailed
in
as
they
passed
--
Dorothy
Perkins
roses
dragged
patiently
through
each
compartment
slowly
waggling
with
the
motion
of
the
funicular
,
letting
go
at
the
last
to
swing
back
to
their
rosy
cluster
.
Again
and
again
these
branches
went
through
the
car
.
In
the
compartment
above
and
in
front
of
Dick
's
,
a
group
of
English
were
standing
up
and
exclaiming
upon
the
backdrop
of
sky
,
when
suddenly
there
was
a
confusion
among
them
--
they
parted
to
give
passage
to
a
couple
of
young
people
who
made
apologies
and
scrambled
over
into
the
rear
compartment
of
the
funicular
--
Dick
's
compartment
.
The
young
man
was
a
Latin
with
the
eyes
of
a
stuffed
deer
;
the
girl
was
Nicole
.
The
two
climbers
gasped
momentarily
from
their
efforts
;
as
they
settled
into
seats
,
laughing
and
crowding
the
English
to
the
corners
,
Nicole
said
,
``
Hello
.
''
She
was
lovely
to
look
at
;
immediately
Dick
saw
that
something
was
different
;
in
a
second
he
realized
it
was
her
fine-spun
hair
,
bobbed
like
Irene
Castle
's
and
fluffed
into
curls
.
She
wore
a
sweater
of
powder
blue
and
a
white
tennis
skirt
--
she
was
the
first
morning
in
May
and
every
taint
of
the
clinic
was
departed
.
``
Plunk
!
''
she
gasped
.
``
Whoo-oo
that
guard
.
They
'll
arrest
us
at
the
next
stop
.
Doctor
Diver
,
the
Conte
de
Marmora
.
''
``
Gee-imminy
!
''
She
felt
her
new
hair
,
panting
.
``
Sister
bought
first-class
tickets
--
it
's
a
matter
of
principle
with
her
.
''
She
and
Marmora
exchanged
glances
and
shouted
:
``
Then
we
found
that
first-class
is
the
hearse
part
behind
the
chauffeur
--
shut
in
with
curtains
for
a
rainy
day
,
so
you
ca
n't
see
anything
.
But
Sister
's
very
dignified
--
''
Again
Nicole
and
Marmora
laughed
with
young
intimacy
.
``
Where
you
bound
?
''
asked
Dick
.
``
Caux
.
You
too
?
''
Nicole
looked
at
his
costume
.
``
That
your
bicycle
they
got
up
in
front
?
''
``
Yes
.
I
'm
going
to
coast
down
Monday
.
''
``
With
me
on
your
handle-bars
?
I
mean
,
really
--
will
you
?
I
ca
n't
think
of
more
fun
.
''
``
But
I
will
carry
you
down
in
my
arms
,
''
Marmora
protested
intensely
.
``
I
will
roller-skate
you
--
or
I
will
throw
you
and
you
will
fall
slowly
like
a
feather
.
''
The
delight
in
Nicole
's
face
--
to
be
a
feather
again
instead
of
a
plummet
,
to
float
and
not
to
drag
.
She
was
a
carnival
to
watch
--
at
times
primly
coy
,
posing
,
grimacing
and
gesturing
--
sometimes
the
shadow
fell
and
the
dignity
of
old
suffering
flowed
down
into
her
finger
tips
.
Dick
wished
himself
away
from
her
,
fearing
that
he
was
a
reminder
of
a
world
well
left
behind
.
He
resolved
to
go
to
the
other
hotel
.
When
the
funicular
came
to
rest
those
new
to
it
stirred
in
suspension
between
the
blues
of
two
heavens
.
It
was
merely
for
a
mysterious
exchange
between
the
conductor
of
the
car
going
up
and
the
conductor
of
the
car
coming
down
.
Then
up
and
up
over
a
forest
path
and
a
gorge
--
then
again
up
a
hill
that
became
solid
with
narcissus
,
from
passengers
to
sky
.
The
people
in
Montreux
playing
tennis
in
the
lakeside
courts
were
pinpoints
now
.
Something
new
was
in
the
air
;
freshness
--
freshness
embodying
itself
in
music
as
the
car
slid
into
Glion
and
they
heard
the
orchestra
in
the
hotel
garden
.
When
they
changed
to
the
mountain
train
the
music
was
drowned
by
the
rushing
water
released
from
the
hydraulic
chamber
.
Almost
overhead
was
Caux
,
where
the
thousand
windows
of
a
hotel
burned
in
the
late
sun
.
But
the
approach
was
different
--
a
leather-lunged
engine
pushed
the
passengers
round
and
round
in
a
corkscrew
,
mounting
,
rising
;
they
chugged
through
low-level
clouds
and
for
a
moment
Dick
lost
Nicole
's
face
in
the
spray
of
the
slanting
donkey
engine
;
they
skirted
a
lost
streak
of
wind
with
the
hotel
growing
in
size
at
each
spiral
,
until
with
a
vast
surprise
they
were
there
,
on
top
of
the
sunshine
.
In
the
confusion
of
arrival
,
as
Dick
slung
his
knapsack
and
started
forward
on
the
platform
to
get
his
bicycle
,
Nicole
was
beside
him
.
``
Are
n't
you
at
our
hotel
?
''
she
asked
.
``
I
'm
economizing
.
''
``
Will
you
come
down
and
have
dinner
?
''
Some
confusion
with
baggage
ensued
.
``
This
is
my
sister
--
Doctor
Diver
from
Zurich
.
''
Dick
bowed
to
a
young
woman
of
twenty-five
,
tall
and
confident
.
She
was
both
formidable
and
vulnerable
,
he
decided
,
remembering
other
women
with
flower-like
mouths
grooved
for
bits
.
``
I
'll
drop
in
after
dinner
,
''
Dick
promised
.
``
First
I
must
get
acclimated
.
''
He
wheeled
off
his
bicycle
,
feeling
Nicole
's
eyes
following
him
,
feeling
her
helpless
first
love
,
feeling
it
twist
around
inside
him
.
He
went
three
hundred
yards
up
the
slope
to
the
other
hotel
,
he
engaged
a
room
and
found
himself
washing
without
a
memory
of
the
intervening
ten
minutes
,
only
a
sort
of
drunken
flush
pierced
with
voices
,
unimportant
voices
that
did
not
know
how
much
he
was
loved
.
IX
They
were
waiting
for
him
and
incomplete
without
him
.
He
was
still
the
incalculable
element
;
Miss
Warren
and
the
young
Italian
wore
their
anticipation
as
obviously
as
Nicole
.
The
salon
of
the
hotel
,
a
room
of
fabled
acoustics
,
was
stripped
for
dancing
but
there
was
a
small
gallery
of
Englishwomen
of
a
certain
age
,
with
neckbands
,
dyed
hair
and
faces
powdered
pinkish
gray
;
and
of
American
women
of
a
certain
age
,
with
snowy-white
transformations
,
black
dresses
and
lips
of
cherry
red
.
Miss
Warren
and
Marmora
were
at
a
corner
table
--
Nicole
was
diagonally
across
from
them
forty
yards
away
,
and
as
Dick
arrived
he
heard
her
voice
:
``
Can
you
hear
me
?
I
'm
speaking
naturally
.
''
``
Perfectly
,
''
``
Hello
,
Doctor
Diver
.
''
``
What
's
this
?
''
``
You
realize
the
people
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
ca
n't
hear
what
I
say
,
but
you
can
?
''
``
A
waiter
told
us
about
it
,
''
said
Miss
Warren
.
``
Corner
to
corner
--
it
's
like
wireless
.
''
It
was
exciting
up
on
the
mountain
,
like
a
ship
at
sea
.
Presently
Marmora
's
parents
joined
them
.
They
treated
the
Warrens
with
respect
--
Dick
gathered
that
their
fortunes
had
something
to
do
with
a
bank
in
Milan
that
had
something
to
do
with
the
Warren
fortunes
.
But
Baby
Warren
wanted
to
talk
to
Dick
,
wanted
to
talk
to
him
with
the
impetus
that
sent
her
out
vagrantly
toward
all
new
men
,
as
though
she
were
on
an
inelastic
tether
and
considered
that
she
might
as
well
get
to
the
end
of
it
as
soon
as
possible
.
She
crossed
and
recrossed
her
knees
frequently
in
the
manner
of
tall
restless
virgins.
``
--
Nicole
told
me
that
you
took
part
care
of
her
,
and
had
a
lot
to
do
with
her
getting
well
.
What
I
ca
n't
understand
is
what
we
're
supposed
to
do
--
they
were
so
indefinite
at
the
sanitarium
;
they
only
told
me
she
ought
to
be
natural
and
gay
.
I
knew
the
Marmoras
were
up
here
so
I
asked
Tino
to
meet
us
at
the
funicular
.
And
you
see
what
happens
--
the
very
first
thing
Nicole
has
him
crawling
over
the
sides
of
the
car
as
if
they
were
both
insane
--
''
``
That
was
absolutely
normal
,
''
Dick
laughed
.
``
I
'd
call
it
a
good
sign
.
They
were
showing
off
for
each
other
.
''
``
But
how
can
I
tell
?
Before
I
knew
it
,
almost
in
front
of
my
eyes
,
she
had
her
hair
cut
off
,
in
Zurich
,
because
of
a
picture
in
'Vanity
Fair
.
'
''
``
That
's
all
right
.
She
's
a
schizoid
--
a
permanent
eccentric
.
You
ca
n't
change
that
.
''
``
What
is
it
?
''
``
Just
what
I
said
--
an
eccentric
.
''
``
Well
,
how
can
any
one
tell
what
's
eccentric
and
what
's
crazy
?
''
``
Nothing
is
going
to
be
crazy
--
Nicole
is
all
fresh
and
happy
,
you
need
n't
be
afraid
.
''
Baby
shifted
her
knees
about
--
she
was
a
compendium
of
all
the
discontented
women
who
had
loved
Byron
a
hundred
years
before
,
yet
,
in
spite
of
the
tragic
affair
with
the
guards
'
officer
there
was
something
wooden
and
onanistic
about
her
.
``
I
do
n't
mind
the
responsibility
,
''
she
declared
,
``
but
I
'm
in
the
air
.
We
've
never
had
anything
like
this
in
the
family
before
--
we
know
Nicole
had
some
shock
and
my
opinion
is
it
was
about
a
boy
,
but
we
do
n't
really
know
.
Father
says
he
would
have
shot
him
if
he
could
have
found
out
.
''
The
orchestra
was
playing
``
Poor
Butterfly
''
;
young
Marmora
was
dancing
with
his
mother
.
It
was
a
tune
new
enough
to
them
all
.
Listening
,
and
watching
Nicole
's
shoulders
as
she
chattered
to
the
elder
Marmora
,
whose
hair
was
dashed
with
white
like
a
piano
keyboard
,
Dick
thought
of
the
shoulders
of
a
violin
,
and
then
he
thought
of
the
dishonor
,
the
secret
.
Oh
,
butterfly
--
the
moments
pass
into
hours
--
``
Actually
I
have
a
plan
,
''
Baby
continued
with
apologetic
hardness
.
``
It
may
seem
absolutely
impractical
to
you
but
they
say
Nicole
will
need
to
be
looked
after
for
a
few
years
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
know
Chicago
or
not
--
''
``
I
do
n't
.
''
``
Well
,
there
's
a
North
Side
and
a
South
Side
and
they
're
very
much
separated
.
The
North
Side
is
chic
and
all
that
,
and
we
've
always
lived
over
there
,
at
least
for
many
years
,
but
lots
of
old
families
,
old
Chicago
families
,
if
you
know
what
I
mean
,
still
live
on
the
South
Side
.
The
University
is
there
.
I
mean
it
's
stuffy
to
some
people
,
but
anyhow
it
's
different
from
the
North
Side
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
understand
.
''
He
nodded
.
With
some
concentration
he
had
been
able
to
follow
her
.
``
Now
of
course
we
have
lots
of
connections
there
--
Father
controls
certain
chairs
and
fellowships
and
so
forth
at
the
University
,
and
I
thought
if
we
took
Nicole
home
and
threw
her
with
that
crowd
--
you
see
she
's
quite
musical
and
speaks
all
these
languages
--
what
could
be
better
in
her
condition
than
if
she
fell
in
love
with
some
good
doctor
--
''
A
burst
of
hilarity
surged
up
in
Dick
,
the
Warrens
were
going
to
buy
Nicole
a
doctor
--
You
got
a
nice
doctor
you
can
let
us
use
?
There
was
no
use
worrying
about
Nicole
when
they
were
in
the
position
of
being
able
to
buy
her
a
nice
young
doctor
,
the
paint
scarcely
dry
on
him
.
``
But
how
about
the
doctor
?
''
he
said
automatically
.
``
There
must
be
many
who
'd
jump
at
the
chance
.
''
The
dancers
were
back
,
but
Baby
whispered
quickly
:
``
This
is
the
sort
of
thing
I
mean
.
Now
where
is
Nicole
--
she
's
gone
off
somewhere
.
Is
she
upstairs
in
her
room
?
What
am
I
supposed
to
do
?
I
never
know
whether
it
's
something
innocent
or
whether
I
ought
to
go
find
her
.
''
``
Perhaps
she
just
wants
to
be
by
herself
--
people
living
alone
get
used
to
loneliness
.
''
Seeing
that
Miss
Warren
was
not
listening
he
stopped
.
``
I
'll
take
a
look
around
.
''
For
a
moment
all
the
outdoors
shut
in
with
mist
was
like
spring
with
the
curtains
drawn
.
Life
was
gathered
near
the
hotel
.
Dick
passed
some
cellar
windows
where
bus
boys
sat
on
bunks
and
played
cards
over
a
litre
of
Spanish
wine
.
As
he
approached
the
promenade
,
the
stars
began
to
come
through
the
white
crests
of
the
high
Alps
.
On
the
horseshoe
walk
overlooking
the
lake
Nicole
was
the
figure
motionless
between
two
lamp
stands
,
and
he
approached
silently
across
the
grass
.
She
turned
to
him
with
an
expression
of
:
``
Here
you
are
,
''
and
for
a
moment
he
was
sorry
he
had
come
.
``
Your
sister
wondered
.
''
``
Oh
!
''
She
was
accustomed
to
being
watched
.
With
an
effort
she
explained
herself
:
``
Sometimes
I
get
a
little
--
it
gets
a
little
too
much
.
I
've
lived
so
quietly
.
To-night
that
music
was
too
much
.
It
made
me
want
to
cry
--
''
``
I
understand
.
''
``
This
has
been
an
awfully
exciting
day
.
''
``
I
know
.
''
``
I
do
n't
want
to
do
anything
anti-social
--
I
've
caused
everybody
enough
trouble
.
But
to-night
I
wanted
to
get
away
.
''
It
occurred
to
Dick
suddenly
,
as
it
might
occur
to
a
dying
man
that
he
had
forgotten
to
tell
where
his
will
was
,
that
Nicole
had
been
``
re-educated
''
by
Dohmler
and
the
ghostly
generations
behind
him
;
it
occurred
to
him
also
that
there
would
be
so
much
she
would
have
to
be
told
.
But
having
recorded
this
wisdom
within
himself
,
he
yielded
to
the
insistent
face-value
of
the
situation
and
said
:
``
You
're
a
nice
person
--
just
keep
using
your
own
judgment
about
yourself
.
''
``
You
like
me
?
''
``
Of
course
.
''
``
Would
you
--
''
They
were
strolling
along
toward
the
dim
end
of
the
horseshoe
,
two
hundred
yards
ahead
.
``
If
I
had
n't
been
sick
would
you
--
I
mean
,
would
I
have
been
the
sort
of
girl
you
might
have
--
oh
,
slush
,
you
know
what
I
mean
.
''
He
was
in
for
it
now
,
possessed
by
a
vast
irrationality
.
She
was
so
near
that
he
felt
his
breathing
change
but
again
his
training
came
to
his
aid
in
a
boy
's
laugh
and
a
trite
remark
.
``
You
're
teasing
yourself
,
my
dear
.
Once
I
knew
a
man
who
fell
in
love
with
his
nurse
--
''
The
anecdote
rambled
on
,
punctuated
by
their
footsteps
.
Suddenly
Nicole
interrupted
in
succinct
Chicagoese
:
``
Bull
!
''
``
That
's
a
very
vulgar
expression
.
''
``
What
about
it
?
''
she
flared
up
.
``
You
do
n't
think
I
've
got
any
common
sense
--
before
I
was
sick
I
did
n't
have
any
,
but
I
have
now
.
And
if
I
do
n't
know
you
're
the
most
attractive
man
I
ever
met
you
must
think
I
'm
still
crazy
.
It
's
my
hard
luck
,
all
right
--
but
do
n't
pretend
I
do
n't
know
--
I
know
everything
about
you
and
me
.
''
Dick
was
at
an
additional
disadvantage
.
He
remembered
the
statement
of
the
elder
Miss
Warren
as
to
the
young
doctors
that
could
be
purchased
in
the
intellectual
stockyards
of
the
South
Side
of
Chicago
,
and
he
hardened
for
a
moment
.
``
You
're
a
fetching
kid
,
but
I
could
n't
fall
in
love
.
''
``
You
wo
n't
give
me
a
chance
.
''
``
What
!
''
The
impertinence
,
the
right
to
invade
implied
,
astounded
him
.
Short
of
anarchy
he
could
not
think
of
any
chance
that
Nicole
Warren
deserved
.
``
Give
me
a
chance
now
.
''
The
voice
fell
low
,
sank
into
her
breast
and
stretched
the
tight
bodice
over
her
heart
as
she
came
up
close
.
He
felt
the
young
lips
,
her
body
sighing
in
relief
against
the
arm
growing
stronger
to
hold
her
.
There
were
now
no
more
plans
than
if
Dick
had
arbitrarily
made
some
indissoluble
mixture
,
with
atoms
joined
and
inseparable
;
you
could
throw
it
all
out
but
never
again
could
they
fit
back
into
atomic
scale
.
As
he
held
her
and
tasted
her
,
and
as
she
curved
in
further
and
further
toward
him
,
with
her
own
lips
,
new
to
herself
,
drowned
and
engulfed
in
love
,
yet
solaced
and
triumphant
,
he
was
thankful
to
have
an
existence
at
all
,
if
only
as
a
reflection
in
her
wet
eyes
.
``
My
God
,
''
he
gasped
,
``
you
're
fun
to
kiss
.
''
That
was
talk
,
but
Nicole
had
a
better
hold
on
him
now
and
she
held
it
;
she
turned
coquette
and
walked
away
,
leaving
him
as
suspended
as
in
the
funicular
of
the
afternoon
.
She
felt
:
There
,
that
'll
show
him
,
how
conceited
;
how
he
could
do
with
me
;
oh
,
was
n't
it
wonderful
!
I
've
got
him
,
he
's
mine
.
Now
in
the
sequence
came
flight
,
but
it
was
all
so
sweet
and
new
that
she
dawdled
,
wanting
to
draw
all
of
it
in
.
She
shivered
suddenly
.
Two
thousand
feet
below
she
saw
the
necklace
and
bracelet
of
lights
that
were
Montreux
and
Vevey
,
beyond
them
a
dim
pendant
of
Lausanne
.
From
down
there
somewhere
ascended
a
faint
sound
of
dance
music
.
Nicole
was
up
in
her
head
now
,
cool
as
cool
,
trying
to
collate
the
sentimentalities
of
her
childhood
,
as
deliberate
as
a
man
getting
drunk
after
battle
.
But
she
was
still
afraid
of
Dick
,
who
stood
near
her
,
leaning
,
characteristically
,
against
the
iron
fence
that
rimmed
the
horseshoe
;
and
this
prompted
her
to
say
:
``
I
can
remember
how
I
stood
waiting
for
you
in
the
garden
--
holding
all
my
self
in
my
arms
like
a
basket
of
flowers
.
It
was
that
to
me
anyhow
--
I
thought
I
was
sweet
--
waiting
to
hand
that
basket
to
you
.
''
He
breathed
over
her
shoulder
and
turned
her
insistently
about
;
she
kissed
him
several
times
,
her
face
getting
big
every
time
she
came
close
,
her
hands
holding
him
by
the
shoulders
.
``
It
's
raining
hard
.
''
Suddenly
there
was
a
booming
from
the
wine
slopes
across
the
lake
;
cannons
were
shooting
at
hail-bearing
clouds
in
order
to
break
them
.
The
lights
of
the
promenade
went
off
,
went
on
again
.
Then
the
storm
came
swiftly
,
first
falling
from
the
heavens
,
then
doubly
falling
in
torrents
from
the
mountains
and
washing
loud
down
the
roads
and
stone
ditches
;
with
it
came
a
dark
,
frightening
sky
and
savage
filaments
of
lightning
and
world-splitting
thunder
,
while
ragged
,
destroying
clouds
fled
along
past
the
hotel
.
Mountains
and
lake
disappeared
--
the
hotel
crouched
amid
tumult
,
chaos
and
darkness
.
By
this
time
Dick
and
Nicole
had
reached
the
vestibule
,
where
Baby
Warren
and
the
three
Marmoras
were
anxiously
awaiting
them
.
It
was
exciting
coming
out
of
the
wet
fog
--
with
the
doors
banging
,
to
stand
and
laugh
and
quiver
with
emotion
,
wind
in
their
ears
and
rain
on
their
clothes
.
Now
in
the
ballroom
the
orchestra
was
playing
a
Strauss
waltz
,
high
and
confusing
.
.
.
.
For
Doctor
Diver
to
marry
a
mental
patient
?
How
did
it
happen
?
Where
did
it
begin
?
``
Wo
n't
you
come
back
after
you
've
changed
?
''
Baby
Warren
asked
after
a
close
scrutiny
.
``
I
have
n't
got
any
change
,
except
some
shorts
.
''
As
he
trudged
up
to
his
hotel
in
a
borrowed
raincoat
he
kept
laughing
derisively
in
his
throat
.
``
Big
chance
--
oh
,
yes
.
My
God
!
--
they
decided
to
buy
a
doctor
?
Well
,
they
better
stick
to
whoever
they
've
got
in
Chicago
.
''
Revolted
by
his
harshness
he
made
amends
to
Nicole
,
remembering
that
nothing
had
ever
felt
so
young
as
her
lips
,
remembering
rain
like
tears
shed
for
him
that
lay
upon
her
softly
shining
porcelain
cheeks
.
.
.
the
silence
of
the
storm
ceasing
woke
him
about
three
o'clock
and
he
went
to
the
window
.
Her
beauty
climbed
the
rolling
slope
,
it
came
into
the
room
,
rustling
ghostlike
through
the
curtains
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
He
climbed
two
thousand
meters
to
Rochers
de
Naye
the
following
morning
,
amused
by
the
fact
that
his
conductor
of
the
day
before
was
using
his
day
off
to
climb
also
.
Then
Dick
descended
all
the
way
to
Montreux
for
a
swim
,
got
back
to
his
hotel
in
time
for
dinner
.
Two
notes
awaited
him
.
``
I
'm
not
ashamed
about
last
night
--
it
was
the
nicest
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
and
even
if
I
never
saw
you
again
,
Mon
Capitaine
,
I
would
be
glad
it
happened
.
''
That
was
disarming
enough
--
the
heavy
shade
of
Dohmler
retreated
as
Dick
opened
the
second
envelope
:
DEAR
DOCTOR
DIVER
:
I
phoned
but
you
were
out
.
I
wonder
if
I
may
ask
you
a
great
big
favor
.
Unforeseen
circumstances
call
me
back
to
Paris
,
and
I
find
I
can
make
better
time
by
way
of
Lausanne
.
Can
you
let
Nicole
ride
as
far
as
Zurich
with
you
,
since
you
are
going
back
Monday
?
and
drop
her
at
the
sanitarium
?
Is
this
too
much
to
ask
?
Sincerely
,
BETH
EVAN
WARREN
.
Dick
was
furious
--
Miss
Warren
had
known
he
had
a
bicycle
with
him
;
yet
she
had
so
phrased
her
note
that
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
.
Throw
us
together
!
Sweet
propinquity
and
the
Warren
money
!
He
was
wrong
;
Baby
Warren
had
no
such
intentions
.
She
had
looked
Dick
over
with
worldly
eyes
,
she
had
measured
him
with
the
warped
rule
of
an
Anglophile
and
found
him
wanting
--
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
found
him
toothsome
.
But
for
her
he
was
too
``
intellectual
''
and
she
pigeonholed
him
with
a
shabby-snobby
crowd
she
had
once
known
in
London
--
he
put
himself
out
too
much
to
be
really
of
the
correct
stuff
.
She
could
not
see
how
he
could
be
made
into
her
idea
of
an
aristocrat
.
In
addition
to
that
he
was
stubborn
--
she
had
seen
him
leave
her
conversation
and
get
down
behind
his
eyes
in
that
odd
way
that
people
did
,
half
a
dozen
times
.
She
had
not
liked
Nicole
's
free
and
easy
manner
as
a
child
and
now
she
was
sensibly
habituated
to
thinking
of
her
as
a
``
gone
coon
''
;
and
anyhow
Doctor
Diver
was
not
the
sort
of
medical
man
she
could
envisage
in
the
family
.
She
only
wanted
to
use
him
innocently
as
a
convenience
.
But
her
request
had
the
effect
that
Dick
assumed
she
desired
.
A
ride
in
a
train
can
be
a
terrible
,
heavy-hearted
or
comic
thing
;
it
can
be
a
trial
flight
;
it
can
be
a
prefiguration
of
another
journey
just
as
a
given
day
with
a
friend
can
be
long
,
from
the
taste
of
hurry
in
the
morning
up
to
the
realization
of
both
being
hungry
and
taking
food
together
.
Then
comes
the
afternoon
with
the
journey
fading
and
dying
,
but
quickening
again
at
the
end
.
Dick
was
sad
to
see
Nicole
's
meagre
joy
;
yet
it
was
a
relief
for
her
,
going
back
to
the
only
home
she
knew
.
They
made
no
love
that
day
,
but
when
he
left
her
outside
the
sad
door
on
the
Zurichsee
and
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
he
knew
her
problem
was
one
they
had
together
for
good
now
.
X
In
Zurich
in
September
Doctor
Diver
had
tea
with
Baby
Warren
.
``
I
think
it
's
ill
advised
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
'm
not
sure
I
truly
understand
your
motives
.
''
``
Do
n't
let
's
be
unpleasant
.
''
``
After
all
I
'm
Nicole
's
sister
.
''
``
That
does
n't
give
you
the
right
to
be
unpleasant
.
''
It
irritated
Dick
that
he
knew
so
much
that
he
could
not
tell
her
.
``
Nicole
's
rich
,
but
that
does
n't
make
me
an
adventurer
.
''
``
That
's
just
it
,
''
complained
Baby
stubbornly
.
``
Nicole
's
rich
.
''
``
Just
how
much
money
has
she
got
?
''
he
asked
.
She
started
;
and
with
a
silent
laugh
he
continued
,
``
You
see
how
silly
this
is
?
I
'd
rather
talk
to
some
man
in
your
family
--
''
``
Everything
's
been
left
to
me
,
''
she
persisted
.
``
It
is
n't
we
think
you
're
an
adventurer
.
We
do
n't
know
who
you
are
.
''
``
I
'm
a
doctor
of
medicine
,
''
he
said
.
``
My
father
is
a
clergyman
,
now
retired
.
We
lived
in
Buffalo
and
my
past
is
open
to
investigation
.
I
went
to
New
Haven
;
afterward
I
was
a
Rhodes
scholar
.
My
great-grandfather
was
Governor
of
North
Carolina
and
I
'm
a
direct
descendant
of
Mad
Anthony
Wayne
.
''
``
Who
was
Mad
Anthony
Wayne
?
''
Baby
asked
suspiciously
.
``
Mad
Anthony
Wayne
?
''
``
I
think
there
's
enough
madness
in
this
affair
.
''
He
shook
his
head
hopelessly
,
just
as
Nicole
came
out
on
the
hotel
terrace
and
looked
around
for
them
.
``
He
was
too
mad
to
leave
as
much
money
as
Marshall
Field
,
''
he
said
.
``
That
's
all
very
well
--
''
Baby
was
right
and
she
knew
it
.
Face
to
face
,
her
father
would
have
it
on
almost
any
clergyman
.
They
were
an
American
ducal
family
without
a
title
--
the
very
name
written
in
a
hotel
register
,
signed
to
an
introduction
,
used
in
a
difficult
situation
,
caused
a
psychological
metamorphosis
in
people
,
and
in
return
this
change
had
crystallized
her
own
sense
of
position
.
She
knew
these
facts
from
the
English
,
who
had
known
them
for
over
two
hundred
years
.
But
she
did
not
know
that
twice
Dick
had
come
close
to
flinging
the
marriage
in
her
face
.
All
that
saved
it
this
time
was
Nicole
finding
their
table
and
glowing
away
,
white
and
fresh
and
new
in
the
September
afternoon
.
How
do
you
do
,
lawyer
.
We
're
going
to
Como
tomorrow
for
a
week
and
then
back
to
Zurich
.
That
's
why
I
wanted
you
and
sister
to
settle
this
,
because
it
does
n't
matter
to
us
how
much
I
'm
allowed
.
We
're
going
to
live
very
quietly
in
Zurich
for
two
years
and
Dick
has
enough
to
take
care
of
us
.
No
,
Baby
,
I
'm
more
practical
than
you
think
--
It
's
only
for
clothes
and
things
I
'll
need
it
.
.
.
.
Why
,
that
's
more
than
--
can
the
estate
really
afford
to
give
me
all
that
?
I
know
I
'll
never
manage
to
spend
it
.
Do
you
have
that
much
?
Why
do
you
have
more
--
is
it
because
I
'm
supposed
to
be
incompetent
?
All
right
,
let
my
share
pile
up
then
.
.
.
.
No
,
Dick
refuses
to
have
anything
whatever
to
do
with
it
.
I
'll
have
to
feel
bloated
for
us
both
.
.
.
.
Baby
,
you
have
no
more
idea
of
what
Dick
is
like
than
,
than
--
Now
where
do
I
sign
?
Oh
,
I
'm
sorry
.
.
.
.
Is
n't
it
funny
and
lonely
being
together
,
Dick
.
No
place
to
go
except
close
.
Shall
we
just
love
and
love
?
Ah
,
but
I
love
the
most
,
and
I
can
tell
when
you
're
away
from
me
,
even
a
little
.
I
think
it
's
wonderful
to
be
just
like
everybody
else
,
to
reach
out
and
find
you
all
warm
beside
me
in
the
bed
.
.
.
.
If
you
will
kindly
call
my
husband
at
the
hospital
.
Yes
,
the
little
book
is
selling
everywhere
--
they
want
it
published
in
six
languages
.
I
was
to
do
the
French
translation
but
I
'm
tired
these
days
--
I
'm
afraid
of
falling
,
I
'm
so
heavy
and
clumsy
--
like
a
broken
roly-poly
that
ca
n't
stand
up
straight
.
The
cold
stethoscope
against
my
heart
and
my
strongest
feeling
``
Je
m'en
fiche
de
tout
.
''
--
Oh
,
that
poor
woman
in
the
hospital
with
the
blue
baby
,
much
better
dead
.
Is
n't
it
fine
there
are
three
of
us
now
?
.
.
.
That
seems
unreasonable
,
Dick
--
we
have
every
reason
for
taking
the
bigger
apartment
.
Why
should
we
penalize
ourselves
just
because
there
's
more
Warren
money
than
Diver
money
.
Oh
,
thank
you
,
cameriere
,
but
we
've
changed
our
minds
.
This
English
clergyman
tells
us
that
your
wine
here
in
Orvieto
is
excellent
.
It
does
n't
travel
?
That
must
be
why
we
have
never
heard
of
it
,
because
we
love
wine
.
The
lakes
are
sunk
in
the
brown
clay
and
the
slopes
have
all
the
creases
of
a
belly
.
The
photographer
gave
us
the
picture
of
me
,
my
hair
limp
over
the
rail
on
the
boat
to
Capri
.
``
Good-by
,
Blue
Grotte
,
''
sang
the
boatman
,
``
come
again
soo-oon
.
''
And
afterward
tracing
down
the
hot
sinister
shin
of
the
Italian
boot
with
the
wind
soughing
around
those
eerie
castles
,
the
dead
watching
from
up
on
those
hills
.
.
.
.
This
ship
is
nice
,
with
our
heels
hitting
the
deck
together
.
This
is
the
blowy
corner
and
each
time
we
turn
it
I
slant
forward
against
the
wind
and
pull
my
coat
together
without
losing
step
with
Dick
.
We
are
chanting
nonsense
:
``
Oh
--
oh
--
oh
--
oh
Other
flamingoes
than
me
,
Oh
--
oh
--
oh
--
oh
Other
flamingoes
than
me
--
''
Life
is
fun
with
Dick
--
the
people
in
deck
chairs
look
at
us
,
and
a
woman
is
trying
to
hear
what
we
are
singing
.
Dick
is
tired
of
singing
it
,
so
go
on
alone
,
Dick
.
You
will
walk
differently
alone
,
dear
,
through
a
thicker
atmosphere
,
forcing
your
way
through
the
shadows
of
chairs
,
through
the
dripping
smoke
of
the
funnels
.
You
will
feel
your
own
reflection
sliding
along
the
eyes
of
those
who
look
at
you
.
You
are
no
longer
insulated
;
but
I
suppose
you
must
touch
life
in
order
to
spring
from
it
.
Sitting
on
the
stanchion
of
this
life-boat
I
look
seaward
and
let
my
hair
blow
and
shine
.
I
am
motionless
against
the
sky
and
the
boat
is
made
to
carry
my
form
onward
into
the
blue
obscurity
of
the
future
,
I
am
Pallas
Athene
carved
reverently
on
the
front
of
a
galley
.
The
waters
are
lapping
in
the
public
toilets
and
the
agate
green
foliage
of
spray
changes
and
complains
about
the
stern
.
.
.
.
We
travelled
a
lot
that
year
--
from
Woolloomooloo
Bay
to
Biskra
.
On
the
edge
of
the
Sahara
we
ran
into
a
plague
of
locusts
and
the
chauffeur
explained
kindly
that
they
were
bumble-bees
.
The
sky
was
low
at
night
,
full
of
the
presence
of
a
strange
and
watchful
God
.
Oh
,
the
poor
little
naked
Ouled
Naïl
;
the
night
was
noisy
with
drums
from
Senegal
and
flutes
and
whining
camels
,
and
the
natives
pattering
about
in
shoes
made
of
old
automobile
tires
.
But
I
was
gone
again
by
that
time
--
trains
and
beaches
they
were
all
one
.
That
was
why
he
took
me
travelling
but
after
my
second
child
,
my
little
girl
,
Topsy
,
was
born
everything
got
dark
again
.
.
.
.
If
I
could
get
word
to
my
husband
who
has
seen
fit
to
desert
me
here
,
to
leave
me
in
the
hands
of
incompetents
.
You
tell
me
my
baby
is
black
--
that
's
farcical
,
that
's
very
cheap
.
We
went
to
Africa
merely
to
see
Timgad
,
since
my
principal
interest
in
life
is
archeology
.
I
am
tired
of
knowing
nothing
and
being
reminded
of
it
all
the
time
.
.
.
.
When
I
get
well
I
want
to
be
a
fine
person
like
you
,
Dick
--
I
would
study
medicine
except
it
's
too
late
.
We
must
spend
my
money
and
have
a
house
--
I
'm
tired
of
apartments
and
waiting
for
you
.
You
're
bored
with
Zurich
and
you
ca
n't
find
time
for
writing
here
and
you
say
that
it
's
a
confession
of
weakness
for
a
scientist
not
to
write
.
And
I
'll
look
over
the
whole
field
of
knowledge
and
pick
out
something
and
really
know
about
it
,
so
I
'll
have
it
to
hang
on
to
if
I
go
to
pieces
again
.
You
'll
help
me
,
Dick
,
so
I
wo
n't
feel
so
guilty
.
We
'll
live
near
a
warm
beach
where
we
can
be
brown
and
young
together
.
.
.
.
This
is
going
to
be
Dick
's
work
house
.
Oh
,
the
idea
came
to
us
both
at
the
same
moment
.
We
had
passed
Tarmes
a
dozen
times
and
we
rode
up
here
and
found
the
houses
empty
,
except
two
stables
.
When
we
bought
we
acted
through
a
Frenchman
but
the
navy
sent
spies
up
here
in
no
time
when
they
found
that
Americans
had
bought
part
of
a
hill
village
.
They
looked
for
cannons
all
through
the
building
material
,
and
finally
Baby
had
to
twitch
wires
for
us
at
the
Affaires
Etrangères
in
Paris
.
No
one
comes
to
the
Riviera
in
summer
,
so
we
expect
to
have
a
few
guests
and
to
work
.
There
are
some
French
people
here
--
Mistinguet
last
week
,
surprised
to
find
the
hotel
open
,
and
Picasso
and
the
man
who
wrote
Pas
sur
la
Bouche
.
.
.
.
Dick
,
why
did
you
register
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Diver
instead
of
Doctor
and
Mrs.
Diver
?
I
just
wondered
--
it
just
floated
through
my
mind.
--
You
've
taught
me
that
work
is
everything
and
I
believe
you
.
You
used
to
say
a
man
knows
things
and
when
he
stops
knowing
things
he
's
like
anybody
else
,
and
the
thing
is
to
get
power
before
he
stops
knowing
things
.
If
you
want
to
turn
things
topsy-turvy
,
all
right
,
but
must
your
Nicole
follow
you
walking
on
her
hands
,
darling
?
.
.
.
Tommy
says
I
am
silent
.
Since
I
was
well
the
first
time
I
talked
a
lot
to
Dick
late
at
night
,
both
of
us
sitting
up
in
bed
and
lighting
cigarettes
,
then
diving
down
afterward
out
of
the
blue
dawn
and
into
the
pillows
,
to
keep
the
light
from
our
eyes
.
Sometimes
I
sing
,
and
play
with
the
animals
,
and
I
have
a
few
friends
too
--
Mary
,
for
instance
.
When
Mary
and
I
talk
neither
of
us
listens
to
the
other
.
Talk
is
men
.
When
I
talk
I
say
to
myself
that
I
am
probably
Dick
.
Already
I
have
even
been
my
son
,
remembering
how
wise
and
slow
he
is
.
Sometimes
I
am
Doctor
Dohmler
and
one
time
I
may
even
be
an
aspect
of
you
,
Tommy
Barban
.
Tommy
is
in
love
with
me
,
I
think
,
but
gently
,
reassuringly
.
Enough
,
though
,
so
that
he
and
Dick
have
begun
to
disapprove
of
each
other
.
All
in
all
,
everything
has
never
gone
better
.
I
am
among
friends
who
like
me
.
I
am
here
on
this
tranquil
beach
with
my
husband
and
two
children
.
Everything
is
all
right
--
if
I
can
finish
translating
this
damn
recipe
for
chicken
a
la
Maryland
into
French
.
My
toes
feel
warm
in
the
sand
.
``
Yes
,
I
'll
look
.
More
new
people
--
oh
,
that
girl
--
yes
.
Who
did
you
say
she
looked
like
.
.
.
.
No
,
I
have
n't
,
we
do
n't
get
much
chance
to
see
the
new
American
pictures
over
here
.
Rosemary
who
?
Well
,
we
're
getting
very
fashionable
for
July
--
seems
very
peculiar
to
me
.
Yes
,
she
's
lovely
,
but
there
can
be
too
many
people
.

XI
Doctor
Richard
Diver
and
Mrs.
Elsie
Speers
sat
in
the
Café
des
Alliées
in
August
,
under
cool
and
dusty
trees
.
The
sparkle
of
the
mica
was
dulled
by
the
baked
ground
,
and
a
few
gusts
of
mistral
from
down
the
coast
seeped
through
the
Esterel
and
rocked
the
fishing
boats
in
the
harbor
,
pointing
the
masts
here
and
there
at
a
featureless
sky
.
``
I
had
a
letter
this
morning
,
''
said
Mrs.
Speers
.
``
What
a
terrible
time
you
all
must
have
had
with
those
Negroes
!
But
Rosemary
said
you
were
perfectly
wonderful
to
her
.
''
``
Rosemary
ought
to
have
a
service
stripe
.
It
was
pretty
harrowing
--
the
only
person
it
did
n't
disturb
was
Abe
North
--
he
flew
off
to
Havre
--
he
probably
does
n't
know
about
it
yet
.
''
``
I
'm
sorry
Mrs.
Diver
was
upset
,
''
she
said
carefully
.
Rosemary
had
written
:
Nicole
seemed
Out
of
her
Mind
.
I
did
n't
want
to
come
South
with
them
because
I
felt
Dick
had
enough
on
his
hands
.
``
She
's
all
right
now
.
''
He
spoke
almost
impatiently
.
``
So
you
're
leaving
to-morrow
.
When
will
you
sail
?
''
``
Right
away
.
''
``
My
God
,
it
's
awful
to
have
you
go
.
''
``
We
're
glad
we
came
here
.
We
've
had
a
good
time
,
thanks
to
you
.
You
're
the
first
man
Rosemary
ever
cared
for
.
''
Another
gust
of
wind
strained
around
the
porphyry
hills
of
la
Napoule
.
There
was
a
hint
in
the
air
that
the
earth
was
hurrying
on
toward
other
weather
;
the
lush
midsummer
moment
outside
of
time
was
already
over
.
``
Rosemary
's
had
crushes
but
sooner
or
later
she
always
turned
the
man
over
to
me
--
''
Mrs.
Speers
laughed
,
``
--
for
dissection
.
''
``
So
I
was
spared
.
''
``
There
was
nothing
I
could
have
done
.
She
was
in
love
with
you
before
I
ever
saw
you
.
I
told
her
to
go
ahead
.
''
He
saw
that
no
provision
had
been
made
for
him
,
or
for
Nicole
,
in
Mrs.
Speers
'
plans
--
and
he
saw
that
her
amorality
sprang
from
the
conditions
of
her
own
withdrawal
.
It
was
her
right
,
the
pension
on
which
her
own
emotions
had
retired
.
Women
are
necessarily
capable
of
almost
anything
in
their
struggle
for
survival
and
can
scarcely
be
convicted
of
such
man-made
crimes
as
``
cruelty
.
''
So
long
as
the
shuffle
of
love
and
pain
went
on
within
proper
walls
Mrs.
Speers
could
view
it
with
as
much
detachment
and
humor
as
a
eunuch
.
She
had
not
even
allowed
for
the
possibility
of
Rosemary
's
being
damaged
--
or
was
she
certain
that
she
could
n't
be
?
``
If
what
you
say
is
true
I
do
n't
think
it
did
her
any
harm
.
''
He
was
keeping
up
to
the
end
the
pretense
that
he
could
still
think
objectively
about
Rosemary
.
``
She
's
over
it
already
.
Still
--
so
many
of
the
important
times
in
life
begin
by
seeming
incidental
.
''
``
This
was
n't
incidental
,
''
Mrs.
Speers
insisted
.
``
You
were
the
first
man
--
you
're
an
ideal
to
her
.
In
every
letter
she
says
that
.
''
``
She
's
so
polite
.
''
``
You
and
Rosemary
are
the
politest
people
I
've
ever
known
,
but
she
means
this
.
''
``
My
politeness
is
a
trick
of
the
heart
.
''
This
was
partly
true
.
From
his
father
Dick
had
learned
the
somewhat
conscious
good
manners
of
the
young
Southerner
coming
north
after
the
Civil
War
.
Often
he
used
them
and
just
as
often
he
despised
them
because
they
were
not
a
protest
against
how
unpleasant
selfishness
was
but
against
how
unpleasant
it
looked
.
``
I
'm
in
love
with
Rosemary
,
''
he
told
her
suddenly
.
``
It
's
a
kind
of
self-indulgence
saying
that
to
you
.
''
It
seemed
very
strange
and
official
to
him
,
as
if
the
very
tables
and
chairs
in
the
Café
des
Alliées
would
remember
it
forever
.
Already
he
felt
her
absence
from
these
skies
:
on
the
beach
he
could
only
remember
the
sun-torn
flesh
of
her
shoulder
;
at
Tarmes
he
crushed
out
her
footprints
as
he
crossed
the
garden
;
and
now
the
orchestra
launching
into
the
Nice
Carnival
Song
,
an
echo
of
last
year
's
vanished
gaieties
,
started
the
little
dance
that
went
on
all
about
her
.
In
a
hundred
hours
she
had
come
to
possess
all
the
world
's
dark
magic
;
the
blinding
belladonna
,
the
caffein
converting
physical
into
nervous
energy
,
the
mandragora
that
imposes
harmony
.
With
an
effort
he
once
more
accepted
the
fiction
that
he
shared
Mrs.
Speers
'
detachment
.
``
You
and
Rosemary
are
n't
really
alike
,
''
he
said
.
``
The
wisdom
she
got
from
you
is
all
molded
up
into
her
persona
,
into
the
mask
she
faces
the
world
with
.
She
does
n't
think
;
her
real
depths
are
Irish
and
romantic
and
illogical
.
''
Mrs.
Speers
knew
too
that
Rosemary
,
for
all
her
delicate
surface
,
was
a
young
mustang
,
perceptibly
by
Captain
Doctor
Hoyt
,
U.S.A.
Cross-sectioned
,
Rosemary
would
have
displayed
an
enormous
heart
,
liver
and
soul
,
all
crammed
close
together
under
the
lovely
shell
.
Saying
good-by
,
Dick
was
aware
of
Elsie
Speers
'
full
charm
,
aware
that
she
meant
rather
more
to
him
than
merely
a
last
unwillingly
relinquished
fragment
of
Rosemary
.
He
could
possibly
have
made
up
Rosemary
--
he
could
never
have
made
up
her
mother
.
If
the
cloak
,
spurs
and
brilliants
in
which
Rosemary
had
walked
off
were
things
with
which
he
had
endowed
her
,
it
was
nice
in
contrast
to
watch
her
mother
's
grace
knowing
it
was
surely
something
he
had
not
evoked
.
She
had
an
air
of
seeming
to
wait
,
as
if
for
a
man
to
get
through
with
something
more
important
than
herself
,
a
battle
or
an
operation
,
during
which
he
must
not
be
hurried
or
interfered
with
.
When
the
man
had
finished
she
would
be
waiting
,
without
fret
or
impatience
,
somewhere
on
a
highstool
,
turning
the
pages
of
a
newspaper
.
``
Good-by
--
and
I
want
you
both
to
remember
always
how
fond
of
you
Nicole
and
I
have
grown
.
''
Back
at
the
Villa
Diana
,
he
went
to
his
work-room
,
and
opened
the
shutters
,
closed
against
the
mid-day
glare
.
On
his
two
long
tables
,
in
ordered
confusion
,
lay
the
materials
of
his
book
.
Volume
I
,
concerned
with
Classification
,
had
achieved
some
success
in
a
small
subsidized
edition
.
He
was
negotiating
for
its
reissue
.
Volume
II
was
to
be
a
great
amplification
of
his
first
little
book
,
A
Psychology
for
Psychiatrists
.
Like
so
many
men
he
had
found
that
he
had
only
one
or
two
ideas
--
that
his
little
collection
of
pamphlets
now
in
its
fiftieth
German
edition
contained
the
germ
of
all
he
would
ever
think
or
know
.
But
he
was
currently
uneasy
about
the
whole
thing
.
He
resented
the
wasted
years
at
New
Haven
,
but
mostly
he
felt
a
discrepancy
between
the
growing
luxury
in
which
the
Divers
lived
,
and
the
need
for
display
which
apparently
went
along
with
it
.
Remembering
his
Rumanian
friend
's
story
,
about
the
man
who
had
worked
for
years
on
the
brain
of
an
armadillo
,
he
suspected
that
patient
Germans
were
sitting
close
to
the
libraries
of
Berlin
and
Vienna
callously
anticipating
him
.
He
had
about
decided
to
brief
the
work
in
its
present
condition
and
publish
it
in
an
undocumented
volume
of
a
hundred
thousand
words
as
an
introduction
to
more
scholarly
volumes
to
follow
.
He
confirmed
this
decision
walking
around
the
rays
of
late
afternoon
in
his
work-room
.
With
the
new
plan
he
could
be
through
by
spring
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
when
a
man
with
his
energy
was
pursued
for
a
year
by
increasing
doubts
,
it
indicated
some
fault
in
the
plan
.
He
laid
the
bars
of
gilded
metal
that
he
used
as
paperweights
along
the
sheaves
of
notes
.
He
swept
up
,
for
no
servant
was
allowed
in
here
,
treated
his
washroom
sketchily
with
Bon
Ami
,
repaired
a
screen
and
sent
off
an
order
to
a
publishing
house
in
Zurich
.
Then
he
drank
an
ounce
of
gin
with
twice
as
much
water
.
He
saw
Nicole
in
the
garden
.
Presently
he
must
encounter
her
and
the
prospect
gave
him
a
leaden
feeling
.
Before
her
he
must
keep
up
a
perfect
front
,
now
and
to-morrow
,
next
week
and
next
year
.
All
night
in
Paris
he
had
held
her
in
his
arms
while
she
slept
light
under
the
luminol
;
in
the
early
morning
he
broke
in
upon
her
confusion
before
it
could
form
,
with
words
of
tenderness
and
protection
,
and
she
slept
again
with
his
face
against
the
warm
scent
of
her
hair
.
Before
she
woke
he
had
arranged
everything
at
the
phone
in
the
next
room
.
Rosemary
was
to
move
to
another
hotel
.
She
was
to
be
``
Daddy
's
Girl
''
and
even
to
give
up
saying
good-by
to
them
.
The
proprietor
of
the
hotel
,
Mr.
McBeth
,
was
to
be
the
three
Chinese
monkeys
.
Packing
amid
the
piled
boxes
and
tissue
paper
of
many
purchases
,
Dick
and
Nicole
left
for
the
Riviera
at
noon
.
Then
there
was
a
reaction
.
As
they
settled
down
in
the
wagon-lit
Dick
saw
that
Nicole
was
waiting
for
it
,
and
it
came
quickly
and
desperately
,
before
the
train
was
out
of
the
ceinture
--
his
only
instinct
was
to
step
off
while
the
train
was
still
going
slow
,
rush
back
and
see
where
Rosemary
was
,
what
she
was
doing
.
He
opened
a
book
and
bent
his
pince-nez
upon
it
,
aware
that
Nicole
was
watching
him
from
her
pillow
across
the
compartment
.
Unable
to
read
,
he
pretended
to
be
tired
and
shut
his
eyes
but
she
was
still
watching
him
,
and
though
still
she
was
half
asleep
from
the
hangover
of
the
drug
,
she
was
relieved
and
almost
happy
that
he
was
hers
again
.
It
was
worse
with
his
eyes
shut
for
it
gave
a
rhythm
of
finding
and
losing
,
finding
and
losing
;
but
so
as
not
to
appear
restless
he
lay
like
that
until
noon
.
At
luncheon
things
were
better
--
it
was
always
a
fine
meal
;
a
thousand
lunches
in
inns
and
restaurants
,
wagon-lits
,
buffets
,
and
aeroplanes
were
a
mighty
collation
to
have
taken
together
.
The
familiar
hurry
of
the
train
waiters
,
the
little
bottles
of
wine
and
mineral
water
,
the
excellent
food
of
the
Paris-Lyons-Méditerranee
gave
them
the
illusion
that
everything
was
the
same
as
before
,
but
it
was
almost
the
first
trip
he
had
ever
taken
with
Nicole
that
was
a
going
away
rather
than
a
going
toward
.
He
drank
a
whole
bottle
of
wine
save
for
Nicole
's
single
glass
;
they
talked
about
the
house
and
the
children
.
But
once
back
in
the
compartment
a
silence
fell
over
them
like
the
silence
in
the
restaurant
across
from
the
Luxembourg
.
Receding
from
a
grief
,
it
seems
necessary
to
retrace
the
same
steps
that
brought
us
there
.
An
unfamiliar
impatience
settled
on
Dick
;
suddenly
Nicole
said
:
``
It
seemed
too
bad
to
leave
Rosemary
like
that
--
do
you
suppose
she
'll
be
all
right
?
''
``
Of
course
.
She
could
take
care
of
herself
anywhere
--
''
Lest
this
belittle
Nicole
's
ability
to
do
likewise
,
he
added
,
``
After
all
,
she
's
an
actress
,
and
even
though
her
mother
's
in
the
background
she
has
to
look
out
for
herself
.
''
``
She
's
very
attractive
.
''
``
She
's
an
infant
.
''
``
She
's
attractive
though
.
''
They
talked
aimlessly
back
and
forth
,
each
speaking
for
the
other
.
``
She
's
not
as
intelligent
as
I
thought
,
''
Dick
offered
.
``
She
's
quite
smart
.
''
``
Not
very
,
though
--
there
's
a
persistent
aroma
of
the
nursery
.
''
``
She
's
very
--
very
pretty
,
''
Nicole
said
in
a
detached
,
emphatic
way
,
``
and
I
thought
she
was
very
good
in
the
picture
.
''
``
She
was
well
directed
.
Thinking
it
over
,
it
was
n't
very
individual
.
''
``
I
thought
it
was
.
I
can
see
how
she
'd
be
very
attractive
to
men
.
''
His
heart
twisted
.
To
what
men
?
How
many
men
?
--
Do
you
mind
if
I
pull
down
the
curtain
?
--
Please
do
,
it
's
too
light
in
here
.
Where
now
?
And
with
whom
?
``
In
a
few
years
she
'll
look
ten
years
older
than
you
.
''
``
On
the
contrary
.
I
sketched
her
one
night
on
a
theatre
program
,
I
think
she
'll
last
.
''
They
were
both
restless
in
the
night
.
In
a
day
or
two
Dick
would
try
to
banish
the
ghost
of
Rosemary
before
it
became
walled
up
with
them
,
but
for
the
moment
he
had
no
force
to
do
it
.
Sometimes
it
is
harder
to
deprive
oneself
of
a
pain
than
of
a
pleasure
and
the
memory
so
possessed
him
that
for
the
moment
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
pretend
.
This
was
more
difficult
because
he
was
currently
annoyed
with
Nicole
,
who
,
after
all
these
years
,
should
recognize
symptoms
of
strain
in
herself
and
guard
against
them
.
Twice
within
a
fortnight
she
had
broken
up
:
there
had
been
the
night
of
the
dinner
at
Tarmes
when
he
had
found
her
in
her
bedroom
dissolved
in
crazy
laughter
telling
Mrs.
McKisco
she
could
not
go
in
the
bathroom
because
the
key
was
thrown
down
the
well
.
Mrs.
McKisco
was
astonished
and
resentful
,
baffled
and
yet
in
a
way
comprehending
.
Dick
had
not
been
particularly
alarmed
then
,
for
afterward
Nicole
was
repentant
.
She
called
at
Gausse
's
Hotel
but
the
McKiscos
were
gone
.
The
collapse
in
Paris
was
another
matter
,
adding
significance
to
the
first
one
.
It
prophesied
possibly
a
new
cycle
,
a
new
pousse
of
the
malady
.
Having
gone
through
unprofessional
agonies
during
her
long
relapse
following
Topsy
's
birth
,
he
had
,
perforce
,
hardened
himself
about
her
,
making
a
cleavage
between
Nicole
sick
and
Nicole
well
.
This
made
it
difficult
now
to
distinguish
between
his
self-protective
professional
detachment
and
some
new
coldness
in
his
heart
.
As
an
indifference
cherished
,
or
left
to
atrophy
,
becomes
an
emptiness
,
to
this
extent
he
had
learned
to
become
empty
of
Nicole
,
serving
her
against
his
will
with
negations
and
emotional
neglect
.
One
writes
of
scars
healed
,
a
loose
parallel
to
the
pathology
of
the
skin
,
but
there
is
no
such
thing
in
the
life
of
an
individual
.
There
are
open
wounds
,
shrunk
sometimes
to
the
size
of
a
pin-prick
but
wounds
still
.
The
marks
of
suffering
are
more
comparable
to
the
loss
of
a
finger
,
or
of
the
sight
of
an
eye
.
We
may
not
miss
them
,
either
,
for
one
minute
in
a
year
,
but
if
we
should
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
about
it
.
XII
He
found
Nicole
in
the
garden
with
her
arms
folded
high
on
her
shoulders
.
She
looked
at
him
with
straight
gray
eyes
,
with
a
child
's
searching
wonder
.
``
I
went
to
Cannes
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
ran
into
Mrs.
Speers
.
She
's
leaving
to-morrow
.
She
wanted
to
come
up
and
say
good-by
to
you
,
but
I
slew
the
idea
.
''
``
I
'm
sorry
.
I
'd
like
to
have
seen
her
.
I
like
her
.
''
``
Who
else
do
you
think
I
saw
--
Bartholomew
Tailor
.
''
``
You
did
n't
.
''
``
I
could
n't
have
missed
that
face
of
his
,
the
old
experienced
weasel
.
He
was
looking
over
the
ground
for
Ciro
's
Menagerie
--
they
'll
all
be
down
next
year
.
I
suspected
Mrs.
Abrams
was
a
sort
of
outpost
.
''
``
And
Baby
was
outraged
the
first
summer
we
came
here
.
''
``
They
do
n't
really
give
a
damn
where
they
are
,
so
I
do
n't
see
why
they
do
n't
stay
and
freeze
in
Deauville
.
''
``
Ca
n't
we
start
rumors
about
cholera
or
something
?
''
``
I
told
Bartholomew
that
some
categories
died
off
like
flies
here
--
I
told
him
the
life
of
a
suck
was
as
short
as
the
life
of
a
machine-gunner
in
the
war
.
''
``
You
did
n't
.
''
``
No
,
I
did
n't
,
''
he
admitted
.
``
He
was
very
pleasant
.
It
was
a
beautiful
sight
,
he
and
I
shaking
hands
there
on
the
boulevard
.
The
meeting
of
Sigmund
Freud
and
Ward
McAllister
.
''
Dick
did
n't
want
to
talk
--
he
wanted
to
be
alone
so
that
his
thoughts
about
work
and
the
future
would
overpower
his
thoughts
of
love
and
to-day
.
Nicole
knew
about
it
but
only
darkly
and
tragically
,
hating
him
a
little
in
an
animal
way
,
yet
wanting
to
rub
against
his
shoulder
.
``
The
darling
,
''
Dick
said
lightly
.
He
went
into
the
house
,
forgetting
something
he
wanted
to
do
there
,
and
then
remembering
it
was
the
piano
.
He
sat
down
whistling
and
played
by
ear
:
``
Just
picture
you
upon
my
knee
With
tea
for
two
and
two
for
tea
And
me
for
you
and
you
for
me
--
''
Through
the
melody
flowed
a
sudden
realization
that
Nicole
,
hearing
it
,
would
guess
quickly
at
a
nostalgia
for
the
past
fortnight
.
He
broke
off
with
a
casual
chord
and
left
the
piano
.
It
was
hard
to
know
where
to
go
.
He
glanced
about
the
house
that
Nicole
had
made
,
that
Nicole
's
grandfather
had
paid
for
.
He
owned
only
his
work
house
and
the
ground
on
which
it
stood
.
Out
of
three
thousand
a
year
and
what
dribbled
in
from
his
publications
he
paid
for
his
clothes
and
personal
expenses
,
for
cellar
charges
,
and
for
Lanier
's
education
,
so
far
confined
to
a
nurse
's
wage
.
Never
had
a
move
been
contemplated
without
Dick
's
figuring
his
share
.
Living
rather
ascetically
,
travelling
third-class
when
he
was
alone
,
with
the
cheapest
wine
,
and
good
care
of
his
clothes
,
and
penalizing
himself
for
any
extravagances
,
he
maintained
a
qualified
financial
independence
.
After
a
certain
point
,
though
,
it
was
difficult
--
again
and
again
it
was
necessary
to
decide
together
as
to
the
uses
to
which
Nicole
's
money
should
be
put
.
Naturally
Nicole
,
wanting
to
own
him
,
wanting
him
to
stand
still
forever
,
encouraged
any
slackness
on
his
part
,
and
in
multiplying
ways
he
was
constantly
inundated
by
a
trickling
of
goods
and
money
.
The
inception
of
the
idea
of
the
cliff
villa
which
they
had
elaborated
as
a
fantasy
one
day
was
a
typical
example
of
the
forces
divorcing
them
from
the
first
simple
arrangements
in
Zurich
.
``
Would
n't
it
be
fun
if
--
''
it
had
been
;
and
then
,
``
Wo
n't
it
be
fun
when
--
''
It
was
not
so
much
fun
.
His
work
became
confused
with
Nicole
's
problems
;
in
addition
,
her
income
had
increased
so
fast
of
late
that
it
seemed
to
belittle
his
work
.
Also
,
for
the
purpose
of
her
cure
,
he
had
for
many
years
pretended
to
a
rigid
domesticity
from
which
he
was
drifting
away
,
and
this
pretense
became
more
arduous
in
this
effortless
immobility
,
in
which
he
was
inevitably
subjected
to
microscopic
examination
.
When
Dick
could
no
longer
play
what
he
wanted
to
play
on
the
piano
,
it
was
an
indication
that
life
was
being
refined
down
to
a
point
.
He
stayed
in
the
big
room
a
long
time
listening
to
the
buzz
of
the
electric
clock
,
listening
to
time
.
In
November
the
waves
grew
black
and
dashed
over
the
sea
wall
onto
the
shore
road
--
such
summer
life
as
had
survived
disappeared
and
the
beaches
were
melancholy
and
desolate
under
the
mistral
and
rain
.
Gausse
's
Hotel
was
closed
for
repairs
and
enlargement
and
the
scaffolding
of
the
summer
Casino
at
Juan
les
Pins
grew
larger
and
more
formidable
.
Going
into
Cannes
or
Nice
,
Dick
and
Nicole
met
new
people
--
members
of
orchestras
,
restaurateurs
,
horticultural
enthusiasts
,
shipbuilders
--
for
Dick
had
bought
an
old
dinghy
--
and
members
of
the
Syndicat
d'Initiative
.
They
knew
their
servants
well
and
gave
thought
to
the
children
's
education
.
In
December
,
Nicole
seemed
well-knit
again
;
when
a
month
had
passed
without
tension
,
without
the
tight
mouth
,
the
unmotivated
smile
,
the
unfathomable
remark
,
they
went
to
the
Swiss
Alps
for
the
Christmas
holidays
.
XIII
With
his
cap
,
Dick
slapped
the
snow
from
his
dark
blue
ski-suit
before
going
inside
.
The
great
hall
,
its
floor
pockmarked
by
two
decades
of
hobnails
,
was
cleared
for
the
tea
dance
,
and
four-score
young
Americans
,
domiciled
in
schools
near
Gstaad
,
bounced
about
to
the
frolic
of
``
Do
n't
Bring
Lulu
,
''
or
exploded
violently
with
the
first
percussions
of
the
Charleston
.
It
was
a
colony
of
the
young
,
simple
,
and
expensive
--
the
Sturmtruppen
of
the
rich
were
at
St.
Moritz
.
Baby
Warren
felt
that
she
had
made
a
gesture
of
renunciation
in
joining
the
Divers
here
.
Dick
picked
out
the
two
sisters
easily
across
the
delicately
haunted
,
soft-swaying
room
--
they
were
poster-like
,
formidable
in
their
snow
costumes
,
Nicole
's
of
cerulean
blue
,
Baby
's
of
brick
red
.
The
young
Englishman
was
talking
to
them
;
but
they
were
paying
no
attention
,
lulled
to
the
staring
point
by
the
adolescent
dance
.
Nicole
's
snow-warm
face
lighted
up
further
as
she
saw
Dick
.
``
Where
is
he
?
''
``
He
missed
the
train
--
I
'm
meeting
him
later
.
''
Dick
sat
down
,
swinging
a
heavy
boot
over
his
knee
.
``
You
two
look
very
striking
together
.
Every
once
in
a
while
I
forget
we
're
in
the
same
party
and
get
a
big
shock
at
seeing
you
.
''
Baby
was
a
tall
,
fine-looking
woman
,
deeply
engaged
in
being
almost
thirty
.
Symptomatically
she
had
pulled
two
men
with
her
from
London
,
one
scarcely
down
from
Cambridge
,
one
old
and
hard
with
Victorian
lecheries
.
Baby
had
certain
spinsters
'
characteristics
--
she
was
alien
from
touch
,
she
started
if
she
was
touched
suddenly
,
and
such
lingering
touches
as
kisses
and
embraces
slipped
directly
through
the
flesh
into
the
forefront
of
her
consciousness
.
She
made
few
gestures
with
her
trunk
,
her
body
proper
--
instead
,
she
stamped
her
foot
and
tossed
her
head
in
almost
an
old-fashioned
way
.
She
relished
the
foretaste
of
death
,
prefigured
by
the
catastrophes
of
friends
--
persistently
she
clung
to
the
idea
of
Nicole
's
tragic
destiny
.
Baby
's
younger
Englishman
had
been
chaperoning
the
women
down
appropriate
inclines
and
harrowing
them
on
the
bob-run
.
Dick
,
having
turned
an
ankle
in
a
too
ambitious
telemark
,
loafed
gratefully
about
the
``
nursery
slope
''
with
the
children
or
drank
kvass
with
a
Russian
doctor
at
the
hotel
.
``
Please
be
happy
,
Dick
,
''
Nicole
urged
him
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
meet
some
of
these
ickle
durls
and
dance
with
them
in
the
afternoon
?
''
``
What
would
I
say
to
them
?
''
Her
low
almost
harsh
voice
rose
a
few
notes
,
simulating
a
plaintive
coquetry
:
``
Say
:
'Ickle
durl
,
oo
is
de
pwettiest
sing
.
'
What
do
you
think
you
say
?
''
``
I
do
n't
like
ickle
durls
.
They
smell
of
castile
soap
and
peppermint
.
When
I
dance
with
them
,
I
feel
as
if
I
'm
pushing
a
baby
carriage
.
''
It
was
a
dangerous
subject
--
he
was
careful
,
to
the
point
of
self-consciousness
,
to
stare
far
over
the
heads
of
young
maidens
.
``
There
's
a
lot
of
business
,
''
said
Baby
.
``
First
place
,
there
's
news
from
home
--
the
property
we
used
to
call
the
station
property
.
The
railroads
only
bought
the
centre
of
it
at
first
.
Now
they
've
bought
the
rest
,
and
it
belonged
to
Mother
.
It
's
a
question
of
investing
the
money
.
''
Pretending
to
be
repelled
by
this
gross
turn
in
the
conversation
,
the
Englishman
made
for
a
girl
on
the
floor
.
Following
him
for
an
instant
with
the
uncertain
eyes
of
an
American
girl
in
the
grip
of
a
life-long
Anglophilia
,
Baby
continued
defiantly
:
``
It
's
a
lot
of
money
.
It
's
three
hundred
thousand
apiece
.
I
keep
an
eye
on
my
own
investments
but
Nicole
does
n't
know
anything
about
securities
,
and
I
do
n't
suppose
you
do
either
.
''
``
I
've
got
to
meet
the
train
,
''
Dick
said
evasively
.
Outside
he
inhaled
damp
snowflakes
that
he
could
no
longer
see
against
the
darkening
sky
.
Three
children
sledding
past
shouted
a
warning
in
some
strange
language
;
he
heard
them
yell
at
the
next
bend
and
a
little
farther
on
he
heard
sleigh-bells
coming
up
the
hill
in
the
dark
.
The
holiday
station
glittered
with
expectancy
,
boys
and
girls
waiting
for
new
boys
and
girls
,
and
by
the
time
the
train
arrived
,
Dick
had
caught
the
rhythm
,
and
pretended
to
Franz
Gregorovius
that
he
was
clipping
off
a
half-hour
from
an
endless
roll
of
pleasures
.
But
Franz
had
some
intensity
of
purpose
at
the
moment
that
fought
through
any
superimposition
of
mood
on
Dick
's
part
.
``
I
may
get
up
to
Zurich
for
a
day
,
''
Dick
had
written
,
``
or
you
can
manage
to
come
to
Lausanne
.
''
Franz
had
managed
to
come
all
the
way
to
Gstaad
.
He
was
forty
.
Upon
his
healthy
maturity
reposed
a
set
of
pleasant
official
manners
,
but
he
was
most
at
home
in
a
somewhat
stuffy
safety
from
which
he
could
despise
the
broken
rich
whom
he
re-educated
.
His
scientific
heredity
might
have
bequeathed
him
a
wider
world
but
he
seemed
to
have
deliberately
chosen
the
standpoint
of
an
humbler
class
,
a
choice
typified
by
his
selection
of
a
wife
.
At
the
hotel
Baby
Warren
made
a
quick
examination
of
him
,
and
failing
to
find
any
of
the
hall-marks
she
respected
,
the
subtler
virtues
or
courtesies
by
which
the
privileged
classes
recognized
one
another
,
treated
him
thereafter
with
her
second
manner
.
Nicole
was
always
a
little
afraid
of
him
.
Dick
liked
him
,
as
he
liked
his
friends
,
without
reservations
.
For
the
evening
they
were
sliding
down
the
hill
into
the
village
,
on
those
little
sleds
which
serve
the
same
purpose
as
gondolas
do
in
Venice
.
Their
destination
was
a
hotel
with
an
old-fashioned
Swiss
tap-room
,
wooden
and
resounding
,
a
room
of
clocks
,
kegs
,
steins
,
and
antlers
.
Many
parties
at
long
tables
blurred
into
one
great
party
and
ate
fondue
--
a
peculiarly
indigestible
form
of
Welsh
rarebit
,
mitigated
by
hot
spiced
wine
.
It
was
jolly
in
the
big
room
;
the
younger
Englishman
remarked
it
and
Dick
conceded
that
there
was
no
other
word
.
With
the
pert
heady
wine
he
relaxed
and
pretended
that
the
world
was
all
put
together
again
by
the
gray-haired
men
of
the
golden
nineties
who
shouted
old
glees
at
the
piano
,
by
the
young
voices
and
the
bright
costumes
toned
into
the
room
by
the
swirling
smoke
.
For
a
moment
he
felt
that
they
were
in
a
ship
with
landfall
just
ahead
;
in
the
faces
of
all
the
girls
was
the
same
innocent
expectation
of
the
possibilities
inherent
in
the
situation
and
the
night
.
He
looked
to
see
if
that
special
girl
was
there
and
got
an
impression
that
she
was
at
the
table
behind
them
--
then
he
forgot
her
and
invented
a
rigmarole
and
tried
to
make
his
party
have
a
good
time
.
``
I
must
talk
to
you
,
''
said
Franz
in
English
.
``
I
have
only
twenty-four
hours
to
spend
here
.
''
``
I
suspected
you
had
something
on
your
mind
.
''
``
I
have
a
plan
that
is
--
so
marvellous
.
''
His
hand
fell
upon
Dick
's
knee
.
``
I
have
a
plan
that
will
be
the
making
of
us
two
.
''
``
Well
?
''
``
Dick
--
there
is
a
clinic
we
could
have
together
--
the
old
clinic
of
Braun
on
the
Zugersee
.
The
plant
is
all
modern
except
for
a
few
points
.
He
is
sick
--
he
wants
to
go
up
in
Austria
,
to
die
probably
.
It
is
a
chance
that
is
just
insuperable
.
You
and
me
--
what
a
pair
!
Now
do
n't
say
anything
yet
until
I
finish
.
''
From
the
yellow
glint
in
Baby
's
eyes
,
Dick
saw
she
was
listening
.
``
We
must
undertake
it
together
.
It
would
not
bind
you
too
tight
--
it
would
give
you
a
base
,
a
laboratory
,
a
centre
.
You
could
stay
in
residence
say
no
more
than
half
the
year
,
when
the
weather
is
fine
.
In
winter
you
could
go
to
France
or
America
and
write
your
texts
fresh
from
clinical
experience
.
''
He
lowered
his
voice
.
``
And
for
the
convalescence
in
your
family
,
there
are
the
atmosphere
and
regularity
of
the
clinic
at
hand
.
''
Dick
's
expression
did
not
encourage
this
note
so
Franz
dropped
it
with
the
punctuation
of
his
tongue
leaving
his
lip
quickly
.
``
We
could
be
partners
.
I
the
executive
manager
,
you
the
theoretician
,
the
brilliant
consultant
and
all
that
.
I
know
myself
--
I
know
I
have
no
genius
and
you
have
.
But
,
in
my
way
,
I
am
thought
very
capable
;
I
am
utterly
competent
at
the
most
modern
clinical
methods
.
Sometimes
for
months
I
have
served
as
the
practical
head
of
the
old
clinic
.
The
professor
says
this
plan
is
excellent
,
he
advises
me
to
go
ahead
.
He
says
he
is
going
to
live
forever
,
and
work
up
to
the
last
minute
.
''
Dick
formed
imaginary
pictures
of
the
prospect
as
a
preliminary
to
any
exercise
of
judgment
.
``
What
's
the
financial
angle
?
''
he
asked
.
Franz
threw
up
his
chin
,
his
eyebrows
,
the
transient
wrinkles
of
his
forehead
,
his
hands
,
his
elbows
,
his
shoulders
;
he
strained
up
the
muscles
of
his
legs
,
so
that
the
cloth
of
his
trousers
bulged
,
pushed
up
his
heart
into
his
throat
and
his
voice
into
the
roof
of
his
mouth
.
``
There
we
have
it
!
Money
!
''
he
bewailed
.
``
I
have
little
money
.
The
price
in
American
money
is
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
.
The
innovation
--
ary
--
''
he
tasted
the
coinage
doubtfully
,
``
--
steps
,
that
you
will
agree
are
necessary
,
will
cost
twenty
thousand
dollars
American
.
But
the
clinic
is
a
gold
mine
--
I
tell
you
,
I
have
n't
seen
the
books
.
For
an
investment
of
two
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
dollars
we
have
an
assured
income
of
--
''
Baby
's
curiosity
was
such
that
Dick
brought
her
into
the
conversation
.
``
In
your
experience
,
Baby
,
''
he
demanded
,
``
have
you
found
that
when
a
European
wants
to
see
an
American
very
pressingly
it
is
invariably
something
concerned
with
money
?
''
``
What
is
it
?
''
she
said
innocently
.
``
This
young
Privat-dozent
thinks
that
he
and
I
ought
to
launch
into
big
business
and
try
to
attract
nervous
breakdowns
from
America
.
''
Worried
,
Franz
stared
at
Baby
as
Dick
continued
:
``
But
who
are
we
,
Franz
?
You
bear
a
big
name
and
I
've
written
two
textbooks
.
Is
that
enough
to
attract
anybody
?
And
I
have
n't
got
that
much
money
--
I
have
n't
got
a
tenth
of
it
.
''
Franz
smiled
cynically
.
``
Honestly
I
have
n't
.
Nicole
and
Baby
are
rich
as
Croesus
but
I
have
n't
managed
to
get
my
hands
on
any
of
it
yet
.
''
They
were
all
listening
now
--
Dick
wondered
if
the
girl
at
the
table
behind
was
listening
too
.
The
idea
attracted
him
.
He
decided
to
let
Baby
speak
for
him
,
as
one
often
lets
women
raise
their
voices
over
issues
that
are
not
in
their
hands
.
Baby
became
suddenly
her
grandfather
,
cool
and
experimental
.
``
I
think
it
's
a
suggestion
you
ought
to
consider
,
Dick
.
I
do
n't
know
what
Doctor
Gregory
was
saying
--
but
it
seems
to
me
--
''
Behind
him
the
girl
had
leaned
forward
into
a
smoke
ring
and
was
picking
up
something
from
the
floor
.
Nicole
's
face
,
fitted
into
his
own
across
the
table
--
her
beauty
,
tentatively
nesting
and
posing
,
flowed
into
his
love
,
ever
braced
to
protect
it
.
``
Consider
it
,
Dick
,
''
Franz
urged
excitedly
.
``
When
one
writes
on
psychiatry
,
one
should
have
actual
clinical
contacts
.
Jung
writes
,
Bleuler
writes
,
Freud
writes
,
Forel
writes
,
Adler
writes
--
also
they
are
in
constant
contact
with
mental
disorder
.
''
``
Dick
has
me
,
''
laughed
Nicole
.
``
I
should
think
that
'd
be
enough
mental
disorder
for
one
man
.
''
``
That
's
different
,
''
said
Franz
cautiously
.
Baby
was
thinking
that
if
Nicole
lived
beside
a
clinic
she
would
always
feel
quite
safe
about
her
.
``
We
must
think
it
over
carefully
,
''
she
said
.
Though
amused
at
her
insolence
,
Dick
did
not
encourage
it
.
``
The
decision
concerns
me
,
Baby
,
''
he
said
gently
.
``
It
's
nice
of
you
to
want
to
buy
me
a
clinic
.
''
Realizing
she
had
meddled
,
Baby
withdrew
hurriedly
:
``
Of
course
,
it
's
entirely
your
affair
.
''
``
A
thing
as
important
as
this
will
take
weeks
to
decide
.
I
wonder
how
I
like
the
picture
of
Nicole
and
me
anchored
to
Zurich
--
''
He
turned
to
Franz
,
anticipating
:
``
--
I
know
.
Zurich
has
a
gashouse
and
running
water
and
electric
light
--
I
lived
there
three
years
.
''
``
I
will
leave
you
to
think
it
over
,
''
said
Franz
.
``
I
am
confident
--
''
One
hundred
pair
of
five-pound
boots
had
begun
to
clump
toward
the
door
,
and
they
joined
the
press
.
Outside
in
the
crisp
moonlight
,
Dick
saw
the
girl
tying
her
sled
to
one
of
the
sleighs
ahead
.
They
piled
into
their
own
sleigh
and
at
the
crisp-cracking
whips
the
horses
strained
,
breasting
the
dark
air
.
Past
them
figures
ran
and
scrambled
,
the
younger
ones
shoving
each
other
from
sleds
and
runners
,
landing
in
the
soft
snow
,
then
panting
after
the
horses
to
drop
exhausted
on
a
sled
or
wail
that
they
were
abandoned
.
On
either
side
the
fields
were
beneficently
tranquil
;
the
space
through
which
the
cavalcade
moved
was
high
and
limitless
.
In
the
country
there
was
less
noise
as
though
they
were
all
listening
atavistically
for
wolves
in
the
wide
snow
.
In
Saanen
,
they
poured
into
the
municipal
dance
,
crowded
with
cow
herders
,
hotel
servants
,
shop-keepers
,
ski
teachers
,
guides
,
tourists
,
peasants
.
To
come
into
the
warm
enclosed
place
after
the
pantheistic
animal
feeling
without
,
was
to
reassume
some
absurd
and
impressive
knightly
name
,
as
thunderous
as
spurred
boots
in
war
,
as
football
cleats
on
the
cement
of
a
locker-room
floor
.
There
was
conventional
yodelling
,
and
the
familiar
rhythm
of
it
separated
Dick
from
what
he
had
first
found
romantic
in
the
scene
.
At
first
he
thought
it
was
because
he
had
hounded
the
girl
out
of
his
consciousness
;
then
it
came
to
him
under
the
form
of
what
Baby
had
said
:
``
We
must
think
it
over
carefully
--
''
and
the
unsaid
lines
back
of
that
:
``
We
own
you
,
and
you
'll
admit
it
sooner
or
later
.
It
is
absurd
to
keep
up
the
pretense
of
independence
.
''
It
had
been
years
since
Dick
had
bottled
up
malice
against
a
creature
--
since
freshman
year
at
New
Haven
when
he
had
come
upon
a
popular
essay
about
``
mental
hygiene
.
''
Now
he
lost
his
temper
at
Baby
and
simultaneously
tried
to
coop
it
up
within
him
,
resenting
her
cold
rich
insolence
.
It
would
be
hundreds
of
years
before
any
emergent
Amazons
would
ever
grasp
the
fact
that
a
man
is
vulnerable
only
in
his
pride
,
but
delicate
as
Humpty-Dumpty
once
that
is
meddled
with
--
though
some
of
them
paid
the
fact
a
cautious
lip-service
.
Doctor
Diver
's
profession
of
sorting
the
broken
shells
of
another
sort
of
egg
had
given
him
a
dread
of
breakage
.
But
:
``
There
's
too
much
good
manners
,
''
he
said
on
the
way
back
to
Gstaad
in
the
smooth
sleigh
.
``
Well
,
I
think
that
's
nice
,
''
said
Baby
.
``
No
,
it
is
n't
,
''
he
insisted
to
the
anonymous
bundle
of
fur
.
``
Good
manners
are
an
admission
that
everybody
is
so
tender
that
they
have
to
be
handled
with
gloves
.
Now
,
human
respect
--
you
do
n't
call
a
man
a
coward
or
a
liar
lightly
,
but
if
you
spend
your
life
sparing
people
's
feelings
and
feeding
their
vanity
,
you
get
so
you
ca
n't
distinguish
what
should
be
respected
in
them
.
''
``
I
think
Americans
take
their
manners
rather
seriously
,
''
said
the
elder
Englishman
.
``
I
guess
so
,
''
said
Dick
.
``
My
father
had
the
kind
of
manners
he
inherited
from
the
days
when
you
shot
first
and
apologized
afterward
.
Men
armed
--
why
,
you
Europeans
have
n't
carried
arms
in
civil
life
since
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
--
''
``
Not
actually
,
perhaps
--
''
``
Not
actually
.
Not
really
.
''
``
Dick
,
you
've
always
had
such
beautiful
manners
,
''
said
Baby
conciliatingly
.
The
women
were
regarding
him
across
the
zoo
of
robes
with
some
alarm
.
The
younger
Englishman
did
not
understand
--
he
was
one
of
the
kind
who
were
always
jumping
around
cornices
and
balconies
,
as
if
they
thought
they
were
in
the
rigging
of
a
ship
--
and
filled
the
ride
to
the
hotel
with
a
preposterous
story
about
a
boxing
match
with
his
best
friend
in
which
they
loved
and
bruised
each
other
for
an
hour
,
always
with
great
reserve
.
Dick
became
facetious
.
``
So
every
time
he
hit
you
you
considered
him
an
even
better
friend
?
''
``
I
respected
him
more
.
''
``
It
's
the
premise
I
do
n't
understand
.
You
and
your
best
friend
scrap
about
a
trivial
matter
--
''
``
If
you
do
n't
understand
,
I
ca
n't
explain
it
to
you
,
''
said
the
young
Englishman
coldly
.
--
This
is
what
I
'll
get
if
I
begin
saying
what
I
think
,
Dick
said
to
himself
.
He
was
ashamed
at
baiting
the
man
,
realizing
that
the
absurdity
of
the
story
rested
in
the
immaturity
of
the
attitude
combined
with
the
sophisticated
method
of
its
narration
.
The
carnival
spirit
was
strong
and
they
went
with
the
crowd
into
the
grill
,
where
a
Tunisian
barman
manipulated
the
illumination
in
a
counterpoint
,
whose
other
melody
was
the
moon
off
the
ice
rink
staring
in
the
big
windows
.
In
that
light
,
Dick
found
the
girl
devitalized
,
and
uninteresting
--
he
turned
from
her
to
enjoy
the
darkness
,
the
cigarette
points
going
green
and
silver
when
the
lights
shone
red
,
the
band
of
white
that
fell
across
the
dancers
as
the
door
to
the
bar
was
opened
and
closed
.
``
Now
tell
me
,
Franz
,
''
he
demanded
,
``
do
you
think
after
sitting
up
all
night
drinking
beer
,
you
can
go
back
and
convince
your
patients
that
you
have
any
character
?
Do
n't
you
think
they
'll
see
you
're
a
gastropath
?
''
``
I
'm
going
to
bed
,
''
Nicole
announced
.
Dick
accompanied
her
to
the
door
of
the
elevator
.
``
I
'd
come
with
you
but
I
must
show
Franz
that
I
'm
not
intended
for
a
clinician
.
''
Nicole
walked
into
the
elevator
.
``
Baby
has
lots
of
common
sense
,
''
she
said
meditatively
.
``
Baby
is
one
of
--
''
The
door
slashed
shut
--
facing
a
mechanical
hum
,
Dick
finished
the
sentence
in
his
mind
,
``
--
Baby
is
a
trivial
,
selfish
woman
.
''
But
two
days
later
,
sleighing
to
the
station
with
Franz
,
Dick
admitted
that
he
thought
favorably
upon
the
matter
.
``
We
're
beginning
to
turn
in
a
circle
,
''
he
admitted
.
``
Living
on
this
scale
,
there
's
an
unavoidable
series
of
strains
,
and
Nicole
does
n't
survive
them
.
The
pastoral
quality
down
on
the
summer
Riviera
is
all
changing
anyhow
--
next
year
they
'll
have
a
Season
.
''
They
passed
the
crisp
green
rinks
where
Wiener
waltzes
blared
and
the
colors
of
many
mountain
schools
flashed
against
the
pale-blue
skies.
``
--
I
hope
we
'll
be
able
to
do
it
,
Franz
.
There
's
nobody
I
'd
rather
try
it
with
than
you
--
''
Good-by
,
Gstaad
!
Good-by
,
fresh
faces
,
cold
sweet
flowers
,
flakes
in
the
darkness
.
Good-by
,
Gstaad
,
good-by
!
XIV
Dick
awoke
at
five
after
a
long
dream
of
war
,
walked
to
the
window
and
stared
out
it
at
the
Zugersee
.
His
dream
had
begun
in
sombre
majesty
;
navy
blue
uniforms
crossed
a
dark
plaza
behind
bands
playing
the
second
movement
of
Prokofieff
's
``
Love
of
Three
Oranges
.
''
Presently
there
were
fire
engines
,
symbols
of
disaster
,
and
a
ghastly
uprising
of
the
mutilated
in
a
dressing
station
.
He
turned
on
his
bed-lamp
light
and
made
a
thorough
note
of
it
ending
with
the
half-ironic
phrase
:
``
Non-combatant
's
shell-shock
.
''
As
he
sat
on
the
side
of
his
bed
,
he
felt
the
room
,
the
house
and
the
night
as
empty
.
In
the
next
room
Nicole
muttered
something
desolate
and
he
felt
sorry
for
whatever
loneliness
she
was
feeling
in
her
sleep
.
For
him
time
stood
still
and
then
every
few
years
accelerated
in
a
rush
,
like
the
quick
re-wind
of
a
film
,
but
for
Nicole
the
years
slipped
away
by
clock
and
calendar
and
birthday
,
with
the
added
poignance
of
her
perishable
beauty
.
Even
this
past
year
and
a
half
on
the
Zugersee
seemed
wasted
time
for
her
,
the
seasons
marked
only
by
the
workmen
on
the
road
turning
pink
in
May
,
brown
in
July
,
black
in
September
,
white
again
in
Spring
.
She
had
come
out
of
her
first
illness
alive
with
new
hopes
,
expecting
so
much
,
yet
deprived
of
any
subsistence
except
Dick
,
bringing
up
children
she
could
only
pretend
gently
to
love
,
guided
orphans
.
The
people
she
liked
,
rebels
mostly
,
disturbed
her
and
were
bad
for
her
--
she
sought
in
them
the
vitality
that
had
made
them
independent
or
creative
or
rugged
,
sought
in
vain
--
for
their
secrets
were
buried
deep
in
childhood
struggles
they
had
forgotten
.
They
were
more
interested
in
Nicole
's
exterior
harmony
and
charm
,
the
other
face
of
her
illness
.
She
led
a
lonely
life
owning
Dick
who
did
not
want
to
be
owned
.
Many
times
he
had
tried
unsuccessfully
to
let
go
his
hold
on
her
.
They
had
many
fine
times
together
,
fine
talks
between
the
loves
of
the
white
nights
,
but
always
when
he
turned
away
from
her
into
himself
he
left
her
holding
Nothing
in
her
hands
and
staring
at
it
,
calling
it
many
names
,
but
knowing
it
was
only
the
hope
that
he
would
come
back
soon
.
He
scrunched
his
pillow
hard
,
lay
down
,
and
put
the
back
of
his
neck
against
it
as
a
Japanese
does
to
slow
the
circulation
,
and
slept
again
for
a
time
.
Later
,
while
he
shaved
,
Nicole
awoke
and
marched
around
,
giving
abrupt
,
succinct
orders
to
children
and
servants
.
Lanier
came
in
to
watch
his
father
shave
--
living
beside
a
psychiatric
clinic
he
had
developed
an
extraordinary
confidence
in
and
admiration
for
his
father
,
together
with
an
exaggerated
indifference
toward
most
other
adults
;
the
patients
appeared
to
him
either
in
their
odd
aspects
,
or
else
as
devitalized
,
over-correct
creatures
without
personality
.
He
was
a
handsome
,
promising
boy
and
Dick
devoted
much
time
to
him
,
in
the
relationship
of
a
sympathetic
but
exacting
officer
and
respectful
enlisted
man
.
``
Why
,
''
Lanier
asked
,
``
do
you
always
leave
a
little
lather
on
the
top
of
your
hair
when
you
shave
?
''
Cautiously
Dick
parted
soapy
lips
:
``
I
have
never
been
able
to
find
out
.
I
've
often
wondered
.
I
think
it
's
because
I
get
the
first
finger
soapy
when
I
make
the
line
of
my
side-burn
,
but
how
it
gets
up
on
top
of
my
head
I
do
n't
know
.
''
``
I
'm
going
to
watch
it
all
to-morrow
.
''
``
That
's
your
only
question
before
breakfast
?
''
``
I
do
n't
really
call
it
a
question
.
''
``
That
's
one
on
you
.
''
Half
an
hour
later
Dick
started
up
to
the
administration
building
.
He
was
thirty-eight
--
still
declining
a
beard
he
yet
had
a
more
medical
aura
about
him
than
he
had
worn
upon
the
Riviera
.
For
eighteen
months
now
he
had
lived
at
the
clinic
--
certainly
one
of
the
best-appointed
in
Europe
.
Like
Dohmler
's
it
was
of
the
modern
type
--
no
longer
a
single
dark
and
sinister
building
but
a
small
,
scattered
,
yet
deceitfully
integrated
village
--
Dick
and
Nicole
had
added
much
in
the
domain
of
taste
,
so
that
the
plant
was
a
thing
of
beauty
,
visited
by
every
psychologist
passing
through
Zurich
.
With
the
addition
of
a
caddy
house
it
might
very
well
have
been
a
country
club
.
The
Eglantine
and
the
Beeches
,
houses
for
those
sunk
into
eternal
darkness
,
were
screened
by
little
copses
from
the
main
building
,
camouflaged
strong-points
.
Behind
was
a
large
truck
farm
,
worked
partly
by
the
patients
.
The
workshops
for
ergo-therapy
were
three
,
placed
under
a
single
roof
and
there
Doctor
Diver
began
his
morning
's
inspection
.
The
carpentry
shop
,
full
of
sunlight
,
exuded
the
sweetness
of
sawdust
,
of
a
lost
age
of
wood
;
always
half
a
dozen
men
were
there
,
hammering
,
planing
,
buzzing
--
silent
men
,
who
lifted
solemn
eyes
from
their
work
as
he
passed
through
.
Himself
a
good
carpenter
,
he
discussed
with
them
the
efficiency
of
some
tools
for
a
moment
in
a
quiet
,
personal
,
interested
voice
.
Adjoining
was
the
book-bindery
,
adapted
to
the
most
mobile
of
patients
who
were
not
always
,
however
,
those
who
had
the
greatest
chance
for
recovery
.
The
last
chamber
was
devoted
to
beadwork
,
weaving
and
work
in
brass
.
The
faces
of
the
patients
here
wore
the
expression
of
one
who
had
just
sighed
profoundly
,
dismissing
something
insoluble
--
but
their
sighs
only
marked
the
beginning
of
another
ceaseless
round
of
ratiocination
,
not
in
a
line
as
with
normal
people
but
in
the
same
circle
.
Round
,
round
,
and
round
.
Around
forever
.
But
the
bright
colors
of
the
stuffs
they
worked
with
gave
strangers
a
momentary
illusion
that
all
was
well
,
as
in
a
kindergarten
.
These
patients
brightened
as
Doctor
Diver
came
in
.
Most
of
them
liked
him
better
than
they
liked
Doctor
Gregorovius
.
Those
who
had
once
lived
in
the
great
world
invariably
liked
him
better
.
There
were
a
few
who
thought
he
neglected
them
,
or
that
he
was
not
simple
,
or
that
he
posed
.
Their
responses
were
not
dissimilar
to
those
that
Dick
evoked
in
non-professional
life
,
but
here
they
were
warped
and
distorted
.
One
Englishwoman
spoke
to
him
always
about
a
subject
which
she
considered
her
own
.
``
Have
we
got
music
to-night
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
have
n't
seen
Doctor
Ladislau
.
How
did
you
enjoy
the
music
that
Mrs.
Sachs
and
Mr.
Longstreet
gave
us
last
night
?
''
``
It
was
so-so
.
''
``
I
thought
it
was
fine
--
especially
the
Chopin
.
''
``
I
thought
it
was
so-so
.
''
``
When
are
you
going
to
play
for
us
yourself
?
''
She
shrugged
her
shoulders
,
as
pleased
at
this
question
as
she
had
been
for
several
years
.
``
Some
time
.
But
I
only
play
so-so
.
''
They
knew
that
she
did
not
play
at
all
--
she
had
had
two
sisters
who
were
brilliant
musicians
,
but
she
had
never
been
able
to
learn
the
notes
when
they
had
been
young
together
.
From
the
workshop
Dick
went
to
visit
the
Eglantine
and
the
Beeches
.
Exteriorly
these
houses
were
as
cheerful
as
the
others
;
Nicole
had
designed
the
decoration
and
the
furniture
on
a
necessary
base
of
concealed
grills
and
bars
and
immovable
furniture
.
She
had
worked
with
so
much
imagination
--
the
inventive
quality
,
which
she
lacked
,
being
supplied
by
the
problem
itself
--
that
no
instructed
visitor
would
have
dreamed
that
the
light
,
graceful
filagree
work
at
a
window
was
a
strong
,
unyielding
end
of
a
tether
,
that
the
pieces
reflecting
modern
tubular
tendencies
were
stancher
than
the
massive
creations
of
the
Edwardians
--
even
the
flowers
lay
in
iron
fingers
and
every
casual
ornament
and
fixture
was
as
necessary
as
a
girder
in
a
skyscraper
.
Her
tireless
eyes
had
made
each
room
yield
up
its
greatest
usefulness
.
Complimented
,
she
referred
to
herself
brusquely
as
a
master
plumber
.
For
those
whose
compasses
were
not
depolarized
there
seemed
many
odd
things
in
these
houses
.
Doctor
Diver
was
often
amused
in
the
Eglantine
,
the
men
's
building
--
here
there
was
a
strange
little
exhibitionist
who
thought
that
if
he
could
walk
unclothed
and
unmolested
from
the
Êtoile
to
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
he
would
solve
many
things
--
and
,
perhaps
,
Dick
thought
,
he
was
quite
right
.
His
most
interesting
case
was
in
the
main
building
.
The
patient
was
a
woman
of
thirty
who
had
been
in
the
clinic
six
months
;
she
was
an
American
painter
who
had
lived
long
in
Paris
.
They
had
no
very
satisfactory
history
of
her
.
A
cousin
had
happened
upon
her
all
mad
and
gone
and
after
an
unsatisfactory
interlude
at
one
of
the
whoopee
cures
that
fringed
the
city
,
dedicated
largely
to
tourist
victims
of
drug
and
drink
,
he
had
managed
to
get
her
to
Switzerland
.
On
her
admittance
she
had
been
exceptionally
pretty
--
now
she
was
a
living
agonizing
sore
.
All
blood
tests
had
failed
to
give
a
positive
reaction
and
the
trouble
was
unsatisfactorily
catalogued
as
nervous
eczema
.
For
two
months
she
had
lain
under
it
,
as
imprisoned
as
in
the
Iron
Maiden
.
She
was
coherent
,
even
brilliant
,
within
the
limits
of
her
special
hallucinations
.
She
was
particularly
his
patient
.
During
spells
of
overexcitement
he
was
the
only
doctor
who
could
``
do
anything
with
her
.
''
Several
weeks
ago
,
on
one
of
many
nights
that
she
had
passed
in
sleepless
torture
Franz
had
succeeded
in
hypnotizing
her
into
a
few
hours
of
needed
rest
,
but
he
had
never
again
succeeded
.
Hypnosis
was
a
tool
that
Dick
had
distrusted
and
seldom
used
,
for
he
knew
that
he
could
not
always
summon
up
the
mood
in
himself
--
he
had
once
tried
it
on
Nicole
and
she
had
scornfully
laughed
at
him
.
The
woman
in
room
twenty
could
not
see
him
when
he
came
in
--
the
area
about
her
eyes
was
too
tightly
swollen
.
She
spoke
in
a
strong
,
rich
,
deep
,
thrilling
voice
.
``
How
long
will
this
last
?
Is
it
going
to
be
forever
?
''
``
It
's
not
going
to
be
very
long
now
.
Doctor
Ladislau
tells
me
there
are
whole
areas
cleared
up
.
''
``
If
I
knew
what
I
had
done
to
deserve
this
I
could
accept
it
with
equanimity
.
''
``
It
is
n't
wise
to
be
mystical
about
it
--
we
recognize
it
as
a
nervous
phenomenon
.
It
's
related
to
the
blush
--
when
you
were
a
girl
,
did
you
blush
easily
?
''
She
lay
with
her
face
turned
to
the
ceiling
.
``
I
have
found
nothing
to
blush
for
since
I
cut
my
wisdom
teeth
.
''
``
Have
n't
you
committed
your
share
of
petty
sins
and
mistakes
?
''
``
I
have
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
.
''
``
You
're
very
fortunate
.
''
The
woman
thought
a
moment
;
her
voice
came
up
through
her
bandaged
face
afflicted
with
subterranean
melodies
:
``
I
'm
sharing
the
fate
of
the
women
of
my
time
who
challenged
men
to
battle
.
''
``
To
your
vast
surprise
it
was
just
like
all
battles
,
''
he
answered
,
adopting
her
formal
diction
.
``
Just
like
all
battles
.
''
She
thought
this
over
.
``
You
pick
a
set-up
,
or
else
win
a
Pyrrhic
victory
,
or
you
're
wrecked
and
ruined
--
you
're
a
ghostly
echo
from
a
broken
wall
.
''
``
You
are
neither
wrecked
nor
ruined
,
''
he
told
her
.
``
Are
you
quite
sure
you
've
been
in
a
real
battle
?
''
``
Look
at
me
!
''
she
cried
furiously
.
``
You
've
suffered
,
but
many
women
suffered
before
they
mistook
themselves
for
men
.
''
It
was
becoming
an
argument
and
he
retreated
.
``
In
any
case
you
must
n't
confuse
a
single
failure
with
a
final
defeat
.
''
She
sneered
.
``
Beautiful
words
,
''
and
the
phrase
transpiring
up
through
the
crust
of
pain
humbled
him
.
``
We
would
like
to
go
into
the
true
reasons
that
brought
you
here
--
''
he
began
but
she
interrupted
.
``
I
am
here
as
a
symbol
of
something
.
I
thought
perhaps
you
would
know
what
it
was
.
''
``
You
are
sick
,
''
he
said
mechanically
.
``
Then
what
was
it
I
had
almost
found
?
''
``
A
greater
sickness
.
''
``
That
's
all
?
''
``
That
's
all
.
''
With
disgust
he
heard
himself
lying
,
but
here
and
now
the
vastness
of
the
subject
could
only
be
compressed
into
a
lie
.
``
Outside
of
that
there
's
only
confusion
and
chaos
.
I
wo
n't
lecture
to
you
--
we
have
too
acute
a
realization
of
your
physical
suffering
.
But
it
's
only
by
meeting
the
problems
of
every
day
,
no
matter
how
trifling
and
boring
they
seem
,
that
you
can
make
things
drop
back
into
place
again
.
After
that
--
perhaps
you
'll
be
able
again
to
examine
--
''
He
had
slowed
up
to
avoid
the
inevitable
end
of
his
thought
:
``
--
the
frontiers
of
consciousness
.
''
The
frontiers
that
artists
must
explore
were
not
for
her
,
ever
.
She
was
fine-spun
,
inbred
--
eventually
she
might
find
rest
in
some
quiet
mysticism
.
Exploration
was
for
those
with
a
measure
of
peasant
blood
,
those
with
big
thighs
and
thick
ankles
who
could
take
punishment
as
they
took
bread
and
salt
,
on
every
inch
of
flesh
and
spirit
.
--
Not
for
you
,
he
almost
said
.
It
's
too
tough
a
game
for
you
.
Yet
in
the
awful
majesty
of
her
pain
he
went
out
to
her
unreservedly
,
almost
sexually
.
He
wanted
to
gather
her
up
in
his
arms
,
as
he
so
often
had
Nicole
,
and
cherish
even
her
mistakes
,
so
deeply
were
they
part
of
her
.
The
orange
light
through
the
drawn
blind
,
the
sarcophagus
of
her
figure
on
the
bed
,
the
spot
of
face
,
the
voice
searching
the
vacuity
of
her
illness
and
finding
only
remote
abstractions
.
As
he
arose
the
tears
fled
lava-like
into
her
bandages
.
``
That
is
for
something
,
''
she
whispered
.
``
Something
must
come
out
of
it
.
''
He
stooped
and
kissed
her
forehead
.
``
We
must
all
try
to
be
good
,
''
he
said
.
Leaving
her
room
he
sent
the
nurse
in
to
her
.
There
were
other
patients
to
see
:
an
American
girl
of
fifteen
who
had
been
brought
up
on
the
basis
that
childhood
was
intended
to
be
all
fun
--
his
visit
was
provoked
by
the
fact
that
she
had
just
hacked
off
all
her
hair
with
a
nail
scissors
.
There
was
nothing
much
to
be
done
for
her
--
a
family
history
of
neurosis
and
nothing
stable
in
her
past
to
build
on
.
The
father
,
normal
and
conscientious
himself
,
had
tried
to
protect
a
nervous
brood
from
life
's
troubles
and
had
succeeded
merely
in
preventing
them
from
developing
powers
of
adjustment
to
life
's
inevitable
surprises
.
There
was
little
that
Dick
could
say
:
``
Helen
,
when
you
're
in
doubt
you
must
ask
a
nurse
,
you
must
learn
to
take
advice
.
Promise
me
you
will
.
''
What
was
a
promise
with
the
head
sick
?
He
looked
in
upon
a
frail
exile
from
the
Caucasus
buckled
securely
in
a
sort
of
hammock
which
in
turn
was
submerged
in
a
warm
medical
bath
,
and
upon
the
three
daughters
of
a
Portuguese
general
who
slid
almost
imperceptibly
toward
paresis
.
He
went
into
the
room
next
to
them
and
told
a
collapsed
psychiatrist
that
he
was
better
,
always
better
,
and
the
man
tried
to
read
his
face
for
conviction
,
since
he
hung
on
the
real
world
only
through
such
reassurance
as
he
could
find
in
the
resonance
,
or
lack
of
it
,
in
Doctor
Diver
's
voice
.
After
that
Dick
discharged
a
shiftless
orderly
and
by
then
it
was
the
lunch
hour
.
XV
Meals
with
the
patients
were
a
chore
he
approached
with
apathy
.
The
gathering
,
which
of
course
did
not
include
residents
at
the
Eglantine
or
the
Beeches
,
was
conventional
enough
at
first
sight
,
but
over
it
brooded
always
a
heavy
melancholy
.
Such
doctors
as
were
present
kept
up
a
conversation
but
most
of
the
patients
,
as
if
exhausted
by
their
morning
's
endeavor
,
or
depressed
by
the
company
,
spoke
little
,
and
ate
looking
into
their
plates
.
Luncheon
over
,
Dick
returned
to
his
villa
.
Nicole
was
in
the
salon
wearing
a
strange
expression
.
``
Read
that
,
''
she
said
.
He
opened
the
letter
.
It
was
from
a
woman
recently
discharged
,
though
with
skepticism
on
the
part
of
the
faculty
.
It
accused
him
in
no
uncertain
terms
of
having
seduced
her
daughter
,
who
had
been
at
her
mother
's
side
during
the
crucial
stage
of
the
illness
.
It
presumed
that
Mrs.
Diver
would
be
glad
to
have
this
information
and
learn
what
her
husband
was
``
really
like
.
''
Dick
read
the
letter
again
.
Couched
in
clear
and
concise
English
he
yet
recognized
it
as
the
letter
of
a
maniac
.
Upon
a
single
occasion
he
had
let
the
girl
,
a
flirtatious
little
brunette
,
ride
into
Zurich
with
him
,
upon
her
request
,
and
in
the
evening
had
brought
her
back
to
the
clinic
.
In
an
idle
,
almost
indulgent
way
,
he
kissed
her
.
Later
,
she
tried
to
carry
the
affair
further
,
but
he
was
not
interested
and
subsequently
,
probably
consequently
,
the
girl
had
come
to
dislike
him
,
and
taken
her
mother
away
.
``
This
letter
is
deranged
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
had
no
relations
of
any
kind
with
that
girl
.
I
did
n't
even
like
her
.
''
``
Yes
,
I
've
tried
thinking
that
,
''
said
Nicole
.
``
Surely
you
do
n't
believe
it
?
''
``
I
've
been
sitting
here
.
''
He
sank
his
voice
to
a
reproachful
note
and
sat
beside
her
.
``
This
is
absurd
.
This
is
a
letter
from
a
mental
patient
.
''
``
I
was
a
mental
patient
.
''
He
stood
up
and
spoke
more
authoritatively
.
``
Suppose
we
do
n't
have
any
nonsense
,
Nicole
.
Go
and
round
up
the
children
and
we
'll
start
.
''
In
the
car
,
with
Dick
driving
,
they
followed
the
little
promontories
of
the
lake
,
catching
the
burn
of
light
and
water
in
the
windshield
,
tunnelling
through
cascades
of
evergreen
.
It
was
Dick
's
car
,
a
Renault
so
dwarfish
that
they
all
stuck
out
of
it
except
the
children
,
between
whom
Mademoiselle
towered
mastlike
in
the
rear
seat
.
They
knew
every
kilometer
of
the
road
--
where
they
would
smell
the
pine
needles
and
the
black
stove
smoke
.
A
high
sun
with
a
face
traced
on
it
beat
fierce
on
the
straw
hats
of
the
children
.
Nicole
was
silent
;
Dick
was
uneasy
at
her
straight
hard
gaze
.
Often
he
felt
lonely
with
her
,
and
frequently
she
tired
him
with
the
short
floods
of
personal
revelations
that
she
reserved
exclusively
for
him
,
``
I
'm
like
this
--
I
'm
more
like
that
,
''
but
this
afternoon
he
would
have
been
glad
had
she
rattled
on
in
staccato
for
a
while
and
given
him
glimpses
of
her
thoughts
.
The
situation
was
always
most
threatening
when
she
backed
up
into
herself
and
closed
the
doors
behind
her
.
At
Zug
Mademoiselle
got
out
and
left
them
.
The
Divers
approached
the
Agiri
Fair
through
a
menagerie
of
mammoth
steamrollers
that
made
way
for
them
.
Dick
parked
the
car
,
and
as
Nicole
looked
at
him
without
moving
,
he
said
:
``
Come
on
,
darl
.
''
Her
lips
drew
apart
into
a
sudden
awful
smile
,
and
his
belly
quailed
,
but
as
if
he
had
n't
seen
it
he
repeated
:
``
Come
on
.
So
the
children
can
get
out
.
''
``
Oh
,
I
'll
come
all
right
,
''
she
answered
,
tearing
the
words
from
some
story
spinning
itself
out
inside
her
,
too
fast
for
him
to
grasp
.
``
Do
n't
worry
about
that
.
I
'll
come
--
''
``
Then
come
.
''
She
turned
from
him
as
he
walked
beside
her
but
the
smile
still
flickered
across
her
face
,
derisive
and
remote
.
Only
when
Lanier
spoke
to
her
several
times
did
she
manage
to
fix
her
attention
upon
an
object
,
a
Punch-and-Judy
show
,
and
to
orient
herself
by
anchoring
to
it
.
Dick
tried
to
think
what
to
do
.
The
dualism
in
his
views
of
her
--
that
of
the
husband
,
that
of
the
psychiatrist
--
was
increasingly
paralyzing
his
faculties
.
In
these
six
years
she
had
several
times
carried
him
over
the
line
with
her
,
disarming
him
by
exciting
emotional
pity
or
by
a
flow
of
wit
,
fantastic
and
disassociated
,
so
that
only
after
the
episode
did
he
realize
with
the
consciousness
of
his
own
relaxation
from
tension
,
that
she
had
succeeded
in
getting
a
point
against
his
better
judgment
.
A
discussion
with
Topsy
about
the
guignol
--
as
to
whether
the
Punch
was
the
same
Punch
they
had
seen
last
year
in
Cannes
--
having
been
settled
,
the
family
walked
along
again
between
the
booths
under
the
open
sky
.
The
women
's
bonnets
,
perching
over
velvet
vests
,
the
bright
,
spreading
skirts
of
many
cantons
,
seemed
demure
against
the
blue
and
orange
paint
of
the
wagons
and
displays
.
There
was
the
sound
of
a
whining
,
tinkling
hootchy-kootchy
show
.
Nicole
began
to
run
very
suddenly
,
so
suddenly
that
for
a
moment
Dick
did
not
miss
her
.
Far
ahead
he
saw
her
yellow
dress
twisting
through
the
crowd
,
an
ochre
stitch
along
the
edge
of
reality
and
unreality
,
and
started
after
her
.
Secretly
she
ran
and
secretly
he
followed
.
As
the
hot
afternoon
went
shrill
and
terrible
with
her
flight
he
had
forgotten
the
children
;
then
he
wheeled
and
ran
back
to
them
,
drawing
them
this
way
and
that
by
their
arms
,
his
eyes
jumping
from
booth
to
booth
.
``
Madame
,
''
he
cried
to
a
young
woman
behind
a
white
lottery
wheel
,
``
Est-ce
que
je
peux
laisser
ces
petits
avec
vous
deux
minutes
?
C'est
très
urgent
--
je
vous
donnerai
dix
francs
.
''
``
Mais
oui
.
''
He
headed
the
children
into
the
booth
.
``
Alors
--
restez
avec
cette
gentille
dame
.
''
``
Oui
,
Dick
.
''
He
darted
off
again
but
he
had
lost
her
;
he
circled
the
merry-go-round
keeping
up
with
it
till
he
realized
he
was
running
beside
it
,
staring
always
at
the
same
horse
.
He
elbowed
through
the
crowd
in
the
buvette
;
then
remembering
a
predilection
of
Nicole
's
he
snatched
up
an
edge
of
a
fortuneteller
's
tent
and
peered
within
.
A
droning
voice
greeted
him
:
``
La
septième
fille
d'une
septième
fille
née
sur
les
rives
du
Nil
--
entrez
,
Monsieur
--
''
Dropping
the
flap
he
ran
along
toward
where
the
plaisance
terminated
at
the
lake
and
a
small
ferris
wheel
revolved
slowly
against
the
sky
.
There
he
found
her
.
She
was
alone
in
what
was
momentarily
the
top
boat
of
the
wheel
,
and
as
it
descended
he
saw
that
she
was
laughing
hilariously
;
he
slunk
back
in
the
crowd
,
a
crowd
which
,
at
the
wheel
's
next
revolution
,
spotted
the
intensity
of
Nicole
's
hysteria
.
``
Regardez-moi
ça
!
''
``
Regarde
donc
cette
Anglaise
!
''
Down
she
dropped
again
--
this
time
the
wheel
and
its
music
were
slowing
and
a
dozen
people
were
around
her
car
,
all
of
them
impelled
by
the
quality
of
her
laughter
to
smile
in
sympathetic
idiocy
.
But
when
Nicole
saw
Dick
her
laughter
died
--
she
made
a
gesture
of
slipping
by
and
away
from
him
but
he
caught
her
arm
and
held
it
as
they
walked
away
.
``
Why
did
you
lose
control
of
yourself
like
that
?
''
``
You
know
very
well
why
.
''
``
No
,
I
do
n't
.
''
``
That
's
just
preposterous
--
let
me
loose
--
that
's
an
insult
to
my
intelligence
.
Do
n't
you
think
I
saw
that
girl
look
at
you
--
that
little
dark
girl
.
Oh
,
this
is
farcical
--
a
child
,
not
more
than
fifteen
.
Do
n't
you
think
I
saw
?
''
``
Stop
here
a
minute
and
quiet
down
.
''
They
sat
at
a
table
,
her
eyes
in
a
profundity
of
suspicion
,
her
hand
moving
across
her
line
of
sight
as
if
it
were
obstructed
.
``
I
want
a
drink
--
I
want
a
brandy
.
''
``
You
ca
n't
have
brandy
--
you
can
have
a
bock
if
you
want
it
.
''
``
Why
ca
n't
I
have
a
brandy
?
''
``
We
wo
n't
go
into
that
.
Listen
to
me
--
this
business
about
a
girl
is
a
delusion
,
do
you
understand
that
word
?
''
``
It
's
always
a
delusion
when
I
see
what
you
do
n't
want
me
to
see
.
''
He
had
a
sense
of
guilt
as
in
one
of
those
nightmares
where
we
are
accused
of
a
crime
which
we
recognize
as
something
undeniably
experienced
,
but
which
upon
waking
we
realize
we
have
not
committed
.
His
eyes
wavered
from
hers
.
``
I
left
the
children
with
a
gypsy
woman
in
a
booth
.
We
ought
to
get
them
.
''
``
Who
do
you
think
you
are
?
''
she
demanded
.
``
Svengali
?
''
Fifteen
minutes
ago
they
had
been
a
family
.
Now
as
she
was
crushed
into
a
corner
by
his
unwilling
shoulder
,
he
saw
them
all
,
child
and
man
,
as
a
perilous
accident
.
``
We
're
going
home
.
''
``
Home
!
''
she
roared
in
a
voice
so
abandoned
that
its
louder
tones
wavered
and
cracked
.
``
And
sit
and
think
that
we
're
all
rotting
and
the
children
's
ashes
are
rotting
in
every
box
I
open
?
That
filth
!
''
Almost
with
relief
he
saw
that
her
words
sterilized
her
,
and
Nicole
,
sensitized
down
to
the
corium
of
the
skin
,
saw
the
withdrawal
in
his
face
.
Her
own
face
softened
and
she
begged
,
``
Help
me
,
help
me
,
Dick
!
''
A
wave
of
agony
went
over
him
.
It
was
awful
that
such
a
fine
tower
should
not
be
erected
,
only
suspended
,
suspended
from
him
.
Up
to
a
point
that
was
right
:
men
were
for
that
,
beam
and
idea
,
girder
and
logarithm
;
but
somehow
Dick
and
Nicole
had
become
one
and
equal
,
not
opposite
and
complementary
;
she
was
Dick
too
,
the
drought
in
the
marrow
of
his
bones
.
He
could
not
watch
her
disintegrations
without
participating
in
them
.
His
intuition
rilled
out
of
him
as
tenderness
and
compassion
--
he
could
only
take
the
characteristically
modern
course
,
to
interpose
--
he
would
get
a
nurse
from
Zurich
,
to
take
her
over
to-night
.
``
You
can
help
me
.
''
Her
sweet
bullying
pulled
him
forward
off
his
feet
.
``
You
've
helped
me
before
--
you
can
help
me
now
.
''
``
I
can
only
help
you
the
same
old
way
.
''
``
Some
one
can
help
me
.
''
``
Maybe
so
.
You
can
help
yourself
most
.
Let
's
find
the
children
.
''
There
were
numerous
lottery
booths
with
white
wheels
--
Dick
was
startled
when
he
inquired
at
the
first
and
encountered
blank
disavowals
.
Evil-eyed
,
Nicole
stood
apart
,
denying
the
children
,
resenting
them
as
part
of
a
downright
world
she
sought
to
make
amorphous
.
Presently
Dick
found
them
,
surrounded
by
women
who
were
examining
them
with
delight
like
fine
goods
,
and
by
peasant
children
staring
.
``
Merci
,
Monsieur
,
ah
Monsieur
est
trop
généreux
.
C'était
un
plaisir
,
M'sieur
,
Madame
.
Au
revoir
,
mes
petits
.
''
They
started
back
with
a
hot
sorrow
streaming
down
upon
them
;
the
car
was
weighted
with
their
mutual
apprehension
and
anguish
,
and
the
children
's
mouths
were
grave
with
disappointment
.
Grief
presented
itself
in
its
terrible
,
dark
unfamiliar
color
.
Somewhere
around
Zug
,
Nicole
,
with
a
convulsive
effort
,
reiterated
a
remark
she
had
made
before
about
a
misty
yellow
house
set
back
from
the
road
that
looked
like
a
painting
not
yet
dry
,
but
it
was
just
an
attempt
to
catch
at
a
rope
that
was
playing
out
too
swiftly
.
Dick
tried
to
rest
--
the
struggle
would
come
presently
at
home
and
he
might
have
to
sit
a
long
time
,
restating
the
universe
for
her
.
A
``
schizophrêne
''
is
well
named
as
a
split
personality
--
Nicole
was
alternately
a
person
to
whom
nothing
need
be
explained
and
one
to
whom
nothing
could
be
explained
.
It
was
necessary
to
treat
her
with
active
and
affirmative
insistence
,
keeping
the
road
to
reality
always
open
,
making
the
road
to
escape
harder
going
.
But
the
brilliance
,
the
versatility
of
madness
is
akin
to
the
resourcefulness
of
water
seeping
through
,
over
and
around
a
dike
.
It
requires
the
united
front
of
many
people
to
work
against
it
.
He
felt
it
necessary
that
this
time
Nicole
cure
herself
;
he
wanted
to
wait
until
she
remembered
the
other
times
,
and
revolted
from
them
.
In
a
tired
way
,
he
planned
that
they
would
again
resume
the
régime
relaxed
a
year
before
.
He
had
turned
up
a
hill
that
made
a
short
cut
to
the
clinic
,
and
now
as
he
stepped
on
the
accelerator
for
a
short
straightaway
run
parallel
to
the
hillside
the
car
swerved
violently
left
,
swerved
right
,
tipped
on
two
wheels
and
,
as
Dick
,
with
Nicole
's
voice
screaming
in
his
ear
,
crushed
down
the
mad
hand
clutching
the
steering
wheel
,
righted
itself
,
swerved
once
more
and
shot
off
the
road
;
it
tore
through
low
underbrush
,
tipped
again
and
settled
slowly
at
an
angle
of
ninety
degrees
against
a
tree
.
The
children
were
screaming
and
Nicole
was
screaming
and
cursing
and
trying
to
tear
at
Dick
's
face
.
Thinking
first
of
the
list
of
the
car
and
unable
to
estimate
it
Dick
bent
away
Nicole
's
arm
,
climbed
over
the
top
side
and
lifted
out
the
children
;
then
he
saw
the
car
was
in
a
stable
position
.
Before
doing
anything
else
he
stood
there
shaking
and
panting
.
``
You
--
!
''
he
cried
.
She
was
laughing
hilariously
,
unashamed
,
unafraid
,
unconcerned
.
No
one
coming
on
the
scene
would
have
imagined
that
she
had
caused
it
;
she
laughed
as
after
some
mild
escape
of
childhood
.
``
You
were
scared
,
were
n't
you
?
''
she
accused
him
.
``
You
wanted
to
live
!
''
She
spoke
with
such
force
that
in
his
shocked
state
Dick
wondered
if
he
had
been
frightened
for
himself
--
but
the
strained
faces
of
the
children
,
looking
from
parent
to
parent
,
made
him
want
to
grind
her
grinning
mask
into
jelly
.
Directly
above
them
,
half
a
kilometer
by
the
winding
road
but
only
a
hundred
yards
climbing
,
was
an
inn
;
one
of
its
wings
showed
through
the
wooded
hill
.
``
Take
Topsy
's
hand
,
''
he
said
to
Lanier
,
``
like
that
,
tight
,
and
climb
up
that
hill
--
see
the
little
path
?
When
you
get
to
the
inn
tell
them
'La
voiture
Divare
est
cassée
.
'
Some
one
must
come
right
down
.
''
Lanier
,
not
sure
what
had
happened
,
but
suspecting
the
dark
and
unprecedented
,
asked
:
``
What
will
you
do
,
Dick
?
''
``
We
'll
stay
here
with
the
car
.
''
Neither
of
them
looked
at
their
mother
as
they
started
off
.
``
Be
careful
crossing
the
road
up
there
!
Look
both
ways
!
''
Dick
shouted
after
them
.
He
and
Nicole
looked
at
each
other
directly
,
their
eyes
like
blazing
windows
across
a
court
of
the
same
house
.
Then
she
took
out
a
compact
,
looked
in
its
mirror
,
and
smoothed
back
the
temple
hair
.
Dick
watched
the
children
climbing
for
a
moment
until
they
disappeared
among
the
pines
half
way
up
;
then
he
walked
around
the
car
to
see
the
damage
and
plan
how
to
get
it
back
on
the
road
.
In
the
dirt
he
could
trace
the
rocking
course
they
had
pursued
for
over
a
hundred
feet
;
he
was
filled
with
a
violent
disgust
that
was
not
like
anger
.
In
a
few
minutes
the
proprietor
of
the
inn
came
running
down
.
``
My
God
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
How
did
it
happen
,
were
you
going
fast
?
What
luck
!
Except
for
that
tree
you
'd
have
rolled
down
hill
!
''
Taking
advantage
of
Emile
's
reality
,
the
wide
black
apron
,
the
sweat
upon
the
rolls
of
his
face
,
Dick
signalled
to
Nicole
in
a
matter-of-fact
way
to
let
him
help
her
from
the
car
;
whereupon
she
jumped
over
the
lower
side
,
lost
her
balance
on
the
slope
,
fell
to
her
knees
and
got
up
again
.
As
she
watched
the
men
trying
to
move
the
car
her
expression
became
defiant
.
Welcoming
even
that
mood
Dick
said
:
``
Go
and
wait
with
the
children
,
Nicole
.
''
Only
after
she
had
gone
did
he
remember
that
she
had
wanted
cognac
,
and
that
there
was
cognac
available
up
there
--
he
told
Emile
never
mind
about
the
car
;
they
would
wait
for
the
chauffeur
and
the
big
car
to
pull
it
up
onto
the
road
.
Together
they
hurried
up
to
the
inn
.
XVI
``
I
want
to
go
away
,
''
he
told
Franz
.
``
For
a
month
or
so
,
for
as
long
as
I
can
.
''
``
Why
not
,
Dick
?
That
was
our
original
arrangement
--
it
was
you
who
insisted
on
staying
.
If
you
and
Nicole
--
''
``
I
do
n't
want
to
go
away
with
Nicole
.
I
want
to
go
away
alone
.
This
last
thing
knocked
me
sideways
--
if
I
get
two
hours
'
sleep
in
twenty-four
,
it
's
one
of
Zwingli
's
miracles
.
''
``
You
wish
a
real
leave
of
abstinence
.
''
``
The
word
is
'absence
.
'
Look
here
:
if
I
go
to
Berlin
to
the
Psychiatric
Congress
could
you
manage
to
keep
the
peace
?
For
three
months
she
's
been
all
right
and
she
likes
her
nurse
.
My
God
,
you
're
the
only
human
being
in
this
world
I
can
ask
this
of
.
''
Franz
grunted
,
considering
whether
or
not
he
could
be
trusted
to
think
always
of
his
partner
's
interest
.
In
Zurich
the
next
week
Dick
drove
to
the
airport
and
took
the
big
plane
for
Munich
.
Soaring
and
roaring
into
the
blue
he
felt
numb
,
realizing
how
tired
he
was
.
A
vast
persuasive
quiet
stole
over
him
,
and
he
abandoned
sickness
to
the
sick
,
sound
to
the
motors
,
direction
to
the
pilot
.
He
had
no
intention
of
attending
so
much
as
a
single
session
of
the
congress
--
he
could
imagine
it
well
enough
,
new
pamphlets
by
Bleuler
and
the
elder
Forel
that
he
could
much
better
digest
at
home
,
the
paper
by
the
American
who
cured
dementia
præcox
by
pulling
out
his
patient
's
teeth
or
cauterizing
their
tonsils
,
the
half-derisive
respect
with
which
this
idea
would
be
greeted
,
for
no
more
reason
than
that
America
was
such
a
rich
and
powerful
country
.
The
other
delegates
from
America
--
red-headed
Schwartz
with
his
saint
's
face
and
his
infinite
patience
in
straddling
two
worlds
,
as
well
as
dozens
of
commercial
alienists
with
hang-dog
faces
,
who
would
be
present
partly
to
increase
their
standing
,
and
hence
their
reach
for
the
big
plums
of
the
criminal
practice
,
partly
to
master
novel
sophistries
that
they
could
weave
into
their
stock
in
trade
,
to
the
infinite
confusion
of
all
values
.
There
would
be
cynical
Latins
,
and
some
man
of
Freud
's
from
Vienna
.
Articulate
among
them
would
be
the
great
Jung
,
bland
,
super-vigorous
,
on
his
rounds
between
the
forests
of
anthropology
and
the
neuroses
of
school-boys
.
At
first
there
would
be
an
American
cast
to
the
congress
,
almost
Rotarian
in
its
forms
and
ceremonies
,
then
the
closer-knit
European
vitality
would
fight
through
,
and
finally
the
Americans
would
play
their
trump
card
,
the
announcement
of
colossal
gifts
and
endowments
,
of
great
new
plants
and
training
schools
,
and
in
the
presence
of
the
figures
the
Europeans
would
blanch
and
walk
timidly
.
But
he
would
not
be
there
to
see
.
They
skirted
the
Vorarlberg
Alps
,
and
Dick
felt
a
pastoral
delight
in
watching
the
villages
.
There
were
always
four
or
five
in
sight
,
each
one
gathered
around
a
church
.
It
was
simple
looking
at
the
earth
from
far
off
,
simple
as
playing
grim
games
with
dolls
and
soldiers
.
This
was
the
way
statesmen
and
commanders
and
all
retired
people
looked
at
things
.
Anyhow
,
it
was
a
good
draft
of
relief
.
An
Englishman
spoke
to
him
from
across
the
aisle
but
he
found
something
antipathetic
in
the
English
lately
.
England
was
like
a
rich
man
after
a
disastrous
orgy
who
makes
up
to
the
household
by
chatting
with
them
individually
,
when
it
is
obvious
to
them
that
he
is
only
trying
to
get
back
his
self-respect
in
order
to
usurp
his
former
power
.
Dick
had
with
him
what
magazines
were
available
on
the
station
quays
:
The
Century
,
The
Motion
Picture
,
L'lllustration
,
and
the
Fliegende
Blätter
,
but
it
was
more
fun
to
descend
in
his
imagination
into
the
villages
and
shake
hands
with
the
rural
characters
.
He
sat
in
the
churches
as
he
sat
in
his
father
's
church
in
Buffalo
,
amid
the
starchy
must
of
Sunday
clothes
.
He
listened
to
the
wisdom
of
the
Near
East
,
was
Crucified
,
Died
,
and
was
Buried
in
the
cheerful
church
,
and
once
more
worried
between
five
or
ten
cents
for
the
collection
plate
,
because
of
the
girl
who
sat
in
the
pew
behind
.
The
Englishman
suddenly
borrowed
his
magazines
with
a
little
small
change
of
conversation
,
and
Dick
,
glad
to
see
them
go
,
thought
of
the
voyage
ahead
of
him
.
Wolf-like
under
his
sheep
's
clothing
of
long-staple
Australian
wool
,
he
considered
the
world
of
pleasure
--
the
incorruptible
Mediterranean
with
sweet
old
dirt
caked
in
the
olive
trees
,
the
peasant
girl
near
Savona
with
a
face
as
green
and
rose
as
the
color
of
an
illuminated
missal
.
He
would
take
her
in
his
hands
and
snatch
her
across
the
border
.
.
.
.
.
.
but
there
he
deserted
her
--
he
must
press
on
toward
the
Isles
of
Greece
,
the
cloudy
waters
of
unfamiliar
ports
,
the
lost
girl
on
shore
,
the
moon
of
popular
songs
.
A
part
of
Dick
's
mind
was
made
up
of
the
tawdry
souvenirs
of
his
boyhood
.
Yet
in
that
somewhat
littered
Five-and-Ten
,
he
had
managed
to
keep
alive
the
low
painful
fire
of
intelligence
.
XVII
Tommy
Barban
was
a
ruler
,
Tommy
was
a
hero
--
Dick
happened
upon
him
in
the
Marienplatz
in
Munich
,
in
one
of
those
cafés
,
where
small
gamblers
diced
on
``
tapestry
''
mats
.
The
air
was
full
of
politics
,
and
the
slap
of
cards
.
Tommy
was
at
a
table
laughing
his
martial
laugh
:
``
Um-buh
--
ha-ha
!
Um-buh
--
ha-ha
!
''
As
a
rule
,
he
drank
little
;
courage
was
his
game
and
his
companions
were
always
a
little
afraid
of
him
.
Recently
an
eighth
of
the
area
of
his
skull
had
been
removed
by
a
Warsaw
surgeon
and
was
knitting
under
his
hair
,
and
the
weakest
person
in
the
café
could
have
killed
him
with
a
flip
of
a
knotted
napkin.
``
--
this
is
Prince
Chillicheff
--
''
A
battered
,
powder-gray
Russian
of
fifty
,
``
--
and
Mr.
McKibben
--
and
Mr.
Hannan
--
''
the
latter
was
a
lively
ball
of
black
eyes
and
hair
,
a
clown
;
and
he
said
immediately
to
Dick
:
``
The
first
thing
before
we
shake
hands
--
what
do
you
mean
by
fooling
around
with
my
aunt
?
''
``
Why
,
I
--
''
``
You
heard
me
.
What
are
you
doing
here
in
Munich
anyhow
?
''
``
Um-bah
--
ha-ha
!
''
laughed
Tommy
.
``
Have
n't
you
got
aunts
of
your
own
?
Why
do
n't
you
fool
with
them
?
''
Dick
laughed
,
whereupon
the
man
shifted
his
attack
:
``
Now
let
's
not
have
any
more
talk
about
aunts
.
How
do
I
know
you
did
n't
make
up
the
whole
thing
?
Here
you
are
a
complete
stranger
with
an
acquaintance
of
less
than
half
an
hour
,
and
you
come
up
to
me
with
a
cock-and-bull
story
about
your
aunts
.
How
do
I
know
what
you
have
concealed
about
you
?
''
Tommy
laughed
again
,
then
he
said
good-naturedly
,
but
firmly
,
``
That
's
enough
,
Carly
.
Sit
down
,
Dick
--
how
're
you
?
How
's
Nicole
?
''
He
did
not
like
any
man
very
much
nor
feel
their
presence
with
much
intensity
--
he
was
all
relaxed
for
combat
;
as
a
fine
athlete
playing
secondary
defense
in
any
sport
is
really
resting
much
of
the
time
,
while
a
lesser
man
only
pretends
to
rest
and
is
at
a
continual
and
self-destroying
nervous
tension
.
Hannan
,
not
entirely
suppressed
,
moved
to
an
adjoining
piano
,
and
with
recurring
resentment
on
his
face
whenever
he
looked
at
Dick
,
played
chords
,
from
time
to
time
muttering
,
``
Your
aunts
,
''
and
,
in
a
dying
cadence
,
``
I
did
n't
say
aunts
anyhow
.
I
said
pants
.
''
``
Well
,
how
're
you
?
''
repeated
Tommy
.
``
You
do
n't
look
so
--
''
he
fought
for
a
word
,
``
--
so
jaunty
as
you
used
to
,
so
spruce
,
you
know
what
I
mean
.
''
The
remark
sounded
too
much
like
one
of
those
irritating
accusations
of
waning
vitality
and
Dick
was
about
to
retort
by
commenting
on
the
extraordinary
suits
worn
by
Tommy
and
Prince
Chillicheff
,
suits
of
a
cut
and
pattern
fantastic
enough
to
have
sauntered
down
Beale
Street
on
a
Sunday
--
when
an
explanation
was
forthcoming
.
``
I
see
you
are
regarding
our
clothes
,
''
said
the
Prince
.
``
We
have
just
come
out
of
Russia
.
''
``
These
were
made
in
Poland
by
the
court
tailor
,
''
said
Tommy
.
``
That
's
a
fact
--
Pilsudski
's
own
tailor
.
''
``
You
've
been
touring
?
''
Dick
asked
.
They
laughed
,
the
Prince
inordinately
meanwhile
clapping
Tommy
on
the
back
.
``
Yes
,
we
have
been
touring
.
That
's
it
,
touring
.
We
have
made
the
grand
Tour
of
all
the
Russias
.
In
state
.
''
Dick
waited
for
an
explanation
.
It
came
from
Mr.
McKibben
in
two
words
.
``
They
escaped
.
''
``
Have
you
been
prisoners
in
Russia
?
''
``
It
was
I
,
''
explained
Prince
Chillicheff
,
his
dead
yellow
eyes
staring
at
Dick
.
``
Not
a
prisoner
but
in
hiding
.
''
``
Did
you
have
much
trouble
getting
out
?
''
``
Some
trouble
.
We
left
three
Red
Guards
dead
at
the
border
.
Tommy
left
two
--

He
held
up
two
fingers
like
a
Frenchman
--
''
I
left
one
.
''
``
That
's
the
part
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
said
Mr.
McKibben
.
``
Why
they
should
have
objected
to
your
leaving
.
''
Hannan
turned
from
the
piano
and
said
,
winking
at
the
others
:
``
Mac
thinks
a
Marxian
is
somebody
who
went
to
St.
Mark
's
school
.
''
It
was
an
escape
story
in
the
best
tradition
--
an
aristocrat
hiding
nine
years
with
a
former
servant
and
working
in
a
government
bakery
;
the
eighteen-year-old
daughter
in
Paris
who
knew
Tommy
Barban
.
.
.
.
During
the
narrative
Dick
decided
that
this
parched
papier
mâché
relic
of
the
past
was
scarcely
worth
the
lives
of
three
young
men
.
The
question
arose
as
to
whether
Tommy
and
Chillicheff
had
been
frightened
.
``
When
I
was
cold
,
''
Tommy
said
.
``
I
always
get
scared
when
I
'm
cold
.
During
the
war
I
was
always
frightened
when
I
was
cold
.
''
McKibben
stood
up
.
``
I
must
leave
.
To-morrow
morning
I
'm
going
to
Innsbruck
by
car
with
my
wife
and
children
--
and
the
governess
.
''
``
I
'm
going
there
to-morrow
,
too
,
''
said
Dick
.
``
Oh
,
are
you
?
''
exclaimed
McKibben
.
``
Why
not
come
with
us
?
It
's
a
big
Packard
and
there
's
only
my
wife
and
my
children
and
myself
--
and
the
governess
--
''
``
I
ca
n't
possibly
--
''
``
Of
course
she
's
not
really
a
governess
,
''
McKibben
concluded
,
looking
rather
pathetically
at
Dick
.
``
As
a
matter
of
fact
my
wife
knows
your
sister-in-law
,
Baby
Warren
.
''
But
Dick
was
not
to
be
drawn
in
a
blind
contract
.
``
I
've
promised
to
travel
with
two
men
.
''
``
Oh
,
''
McKibben
's
face
fell
.
``
Well
,
I
'll
say
good-by
.
''
He
unscrewed
two
blooded
wire-hairs
from
a
nearby
table
and
departed
;
Dick
pictured
the
jammed
Packard
pounding
toward
Innsbruck
with
the
McKibbens
and
their
children
and
their
baggage
and
yapping
dogs
--
and
the
governess
.
``
The
paper
says
they
know
the
man
who
killed
him
,
''
said
Tommy
.
``
But
his
cousins
did
not
want
it
in
the
papers
,
because
it
happened
in
a
speakeasy
.
What
do
you
think
of
that
?
''
``
It
's
what
's
known
as
family
pride
.
''
Hannan
played
a
loud
chord
on
the
piano
to
attract
attention
to
himself
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
his
first
stuff
holds
up
,
''
he
said
.
``
Even
barring
the
Europeans
there
are
a
dozen
Americans
can
do
what
North
did
.
''
It
was
the
first
indication
Dick
had
had
that
they
were
talking
about
Abe
North
.
``
The
only
difference
is
that
Abe
did
it
first
,
''
said
Tommy
.
``
I
do
n't
agree
,
''
persisted
Hannan
.
``
He
got
the
reputation
for
being
a
good
musician
because
he
drank
so
much
that
his
friends
had
to
explain
him
away
somehow
--
''
``
What
's
this
about
Abe
North
?
What
about
him
?
Is
he
in
a
jam
?
''
``
Did
n't
you
read
The
Herald
this
morning
?
''
``
No
.
''
``
He
's
dead
.
He
was
beaten
to
death
in
a
speakeasy
in
New
York
.
He
just
managed
to
crawl
home
to
the
Racquet
Club
to
die
--
''
``
Abe
North
?
''
``
Yes
,
sure
,
they
--
''
``
Abe
North
?
''
Dick
stood
up
.
``
Are
you
sure
he
's
dead
?
''
Hannan
turned
around
to
McKibben
:
``
It
was
n't
the
Racquet
Club
he
crawled
to
--
it
was
the
Harvard
Club
.
I
'm
sure
he
did
n't
belong
to
the
Racquet
.
''
``
The
paper
said
so
,
''
McKibben
insisted
.
``
It
must
have
been
a
mistake
.
I
'm
quite
sure
.
''
``
Beaten
to
death
in
a
speakeasy
.
''
``
But
I
happen
to
know
most
of
the
members
of
the
Racquet
Club
,
''
said
Hannan
.
``
It
must
have
been
the
Harvard
Club
.
''
Dick
got
up
,
Tommy
too
.
Prince
Chillicheff
started
out
of
a
wan
study
of
nothing
,
perhaps
of
his
chances
of
ever
getting
out
of
Russia
,
a
study
that
had
occupied
him
so
long
that
it
was
doubtful
if
he
could
give
it
up
immediately
,
and
joined
them
in
leaving
.
``
Abe
North
beaten
to
death
.
''
On
the
way
to
the
hotel
,
a
journey
of
which
Dick
was
scarcely
aware
,
Tommy
said
:
``
We
're
waiting
for
a
tailor
to
finish
some
suits
so
we
can
get
to
Paris
.
I
'm
going
into
stock-broking
and
they
would
n't
take
me
if
I
showed
up
like
this
.
Everybody
in
your
country
is
making
millions
.
Are
you
really
leaving
to-morrow
?
We
ca
n't
even
have
dinner
with
you
.
It
seems
the
Prince
had
an
old
girl
in
Munich
.
He
called
her
up
but
she
'd
been
dead
five
years
and
we
're
having
dinner
with
the
two
daughters
.
''
The
Prince
nodded
.
``
Perhaps
I
could
have
arranged
for
Doctor
Diver
.
''
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Dick
hastily
.
He
slept
deep
and
awoke
to
a
slow
mournful
march
passing
his
window
.
It
was
a
long
column
of
men
in
uniform
,
wearing
the
familiar
helmet
of
1914
,
thick
men
in
frock
coats
and
silk
hats
,
burghers
,
aristocrats
,
plain
men
.
It
was
a
society
of
veterans
going
to
lay
wreaths
on
the
tombs
of
the
dead
.
The
column
marched
slowly
with
a
sort
of
swagger
for
a
lost
magnificence
,
a
past
effort
,
a
forgotten
sorrow
.
The
faces
were
only
formally
sad
but
Dick
's
lungs
burst
for
a
moment
with
regret
for
Abe
's
death
,
and
his
own
youth
of
ten
years
ago
.
XVIII
He
reached
Innsbruck
at
dusk
,
sent
his
bags
up
to
a
hotel
and
walked
into
town
.
In
the
sunset
the
Emperor
Maximilian
knelt
in
prayer
above
his
bronze
mourners
;
a
quartet
of
Jesuit
novices
paced
and
read
in
the
university
garden
.
The
marble
souvenirs
of
old
sieges
,
marriages
,
anniversaries
,
faded
quickly
when
the
sun
was
down
,
and
he
had
erbsen-suppe
with
würstchen
cut
up
in
it
,
drank
four
helles
of
Pilsener
and
refused
a
formidable
dessert
known
as
``
kaiser-schmarren
.
''
Despite
the
overhanging
mountains
Switzerland
was
far
away
,
Nicole
was
far
away
.
Walking
in
the
garden
later
when
it
was
quite
dark
he
thought
about
her
with
detachment
,
loving
her
for
her
best
self
.
He
remembered
once
when
the
grass
was
damp
and
she
came
to
him
on
hurried
feet
,
her
thin
slippers
drenched
with
dew
.
She
stood
upon
his
shoes
nestling
close
and
held
up
her
face
,
showing
it
as
a
book
open
at
a
page
.
``
Think
how
you
love
me
,
''
she
whispered
.
``
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
love
me
always
like
this
,
but
I
ask
you
to
remember
.
Somewhere
inside
me
there
'll
always
be
the
person
I
am
to-night
.
''
But
Dick
had
come
away
for
his
soul
's
sake
,
and
he
began
thinking
about
that
.
He
had
lost
himself
--
he
could
not
tell
the
hour
when
,
or
the
day
or
the
week
,
the
month
or
the
year
.
Once
he
had
cut
through
things
,
solving
the
most
complicated
equations
as
the
simplest
problems
of
his
simplest
patients
.
Between
the
time
he
found
Nicole
flowering
under
a
stone
on
the
Zurichsee
and
the
moment
of
his
meeting
with
Rosemary
the
spear
had
been
blunted
.
Watching
his
father
's
struggles
in
poor
parishes
had
wedded
a
desire
for
money
to
an
essentially
unacquisitive
nature
.
It
was
not
a
healthy
necessity
for
security
--
he
had
never
felt
more
sure
of
himself
,
more
thoroughly
his
own
man
,
than
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
to
Nicole
.
Yet
he
had
been
swallowed
up
like
a
gigolo
,
and
somehow
permitted
his
arsenal
to
be
locked
up
in
the
Warren
safety-deposit
vaults
.
``
There
should
have
been
a
settlement
in
the
Continental
style
;
but
it
is
n't
over
yet
.
I
've
wasted
eight
years
teaching
the
rich
the
ABC
's
of
human
decency
,
but
I
'm
not
done
.
I
've
got
too
many
unplayed
trumps
in
my
hand
.
''
He
loitered
among
the
fallow
rose
bushes
and
the
beds
of
damp
sweet
indistinguishable
fern
.
It
was
warm
for
October
but
cool
enough
to
wear
a
heavy
tweed
coat
buttoned
by
a
little
elastic
tape
at
the
neck
.
A
figure
detached
itself
from
the
black
shape
of
a
tree
and
he
knew
it
was
the
woman
whom
he
had
passed
in
the
lobby
coming
out
.
He
was
in
love
with
every
pretty
woman
he
saw
now
,
their
forms
at
a
distance
,
their
shadows
on
a
wall
.
Her
back
was
toward
him
as
she
faced
the
lights
of
the
town
.
He
scratched
a
match
that
she
must
have
heard
,
but
she
remained
motionless
.
--
Was
it
an
invitation
?
Or
an
indication
of
obliviousness
?
He
had
long
been
outside
of
the
world
of
simple
desires
and
their
fulfillments
,
and
he
was
inept
and
uncertain
.
For
all
he
knew
there
might
be
some
code
among
the
wanderers
of
obscure
spas
by
which
they
found
each
other
quickly
.
--
Perhaps
the
next
gesture
was
his
.
Strange
children
should
smile
at
each
other
and
say
,
``
Let
's
play
.
''
He
moved
closer
,
the
shadow
moved
sideways
.
Possibly
he
would
be
snubbed
like
the
scapegrace
drummers
he
had
heard
of
in
youth
.
His
heart
beat
loud
in
contact
with
the
unprobed
,
undissected
,
unanalyzed
,
unaccounted
for
.
Suddenly
he
turned
away
,
and
,
as
he
did
,
the
girl
,
too
,
broke
the
black
frieze
she
made
with
the
foliage
,
rounded
a
bench
at
a
moderate
but
determined
pace
and
took
the
path
back
to
the
hotel
.
With
a
guide
and
two
other
men
,
Dick
started
up
the
Birkkarspitze
next
morning
.
It
was
a
fine
feeling
once
they
were
above
the
cowbells
of
the
highest
pastures
--
Dick
looked
forward
to
the
night
in
the
shack
,
enjoying
his
own
fatigue
,
enjoying
the
captaincy
of
the
guide
,
feeling
a
delight
in
his
own
anonymity
.
But
at
mid-day
the
weather
changed
to
black
sleet
and
hail
and
mountain
thunder
.
Dick
and
one
of
the
other
climbers
wanted
to
go
on
but
the
guide
refused
.
Regretfully
they
struggled
back
to
Innsbruck
to
start
again
to-morrow
.
After
dinner
and
a
bottle
of
heavy
local
wine
in
the
deserted
dining-room
,
he
felt
excited
,
without
knowing
why
,
until
he
began
thinking
of
the
garden
.
He
had
passed
the
girl
in
the
lobby
before
supper
and
this
time
she
had
looked
at
him
and
approved
of
him
,
but
it
kept
worrying
him
:
Why
?
When
I
could
have
had
a
good
share
of
the
pretty
women
of
my
time
for
the
asking
,
why
start
that
now
?
With
a
wraith
,
with
a
fragment
of
my
desire
?
Why
?
His
imagination
pushed
ahead
--
the
old
asceticism
,
the
actual
unfamiliarity
,
triumphed
:
God
,
I
might
as
well
go
back
to
the
Riviera
and
sleep
with
Janice
Caricamento
or
the
Wilburhazy
girl
.
To
belittle
all
these
years
with
something
cheap
and
easy
?
He
was
still
excited
,
though
,
and
he
turned
from
the
veranda
and
went
up
to
his
room
to
think
.
Being
alone
in
body
and
spirit
begets
loneliness
,
and
loneliness
begets
more
loneliness
.
Upstairs
he
walked
around
thinking
of
the
matter
and
laying
out
his
climbing
clothes
advantageously
on
the
faint
heater
;
he
again
encountered
Nicole
's
telegram
,
still
unopened
,
with
which
diurnally
she
accompanied
his
itinerary
.
He
had
delayed
opening
it
before
supper
--
perhaps
because
of
the
garden
.
It
was
a
cablegram
from
Buffalo
,
forwarded
through
Zurich
.
``
Your
father
died
peacefully
tonight
.
HOLMES
.
''
He
felt
a
sharp
wince
at
the
shock
,
a
gathering
of
the
forces
of
resistance
;
then
it
rolled
up
through
his
loins
and
stomach
and
throat
.
He
read
the
message
again
.
He
sat
down
on
the
bed
,
breathing
and
staring
;
thinking
first
the
old
selfish
child
's
thought
that
comes
with
the
death
of
a
parent
,
how
will
it
affect
me
now
that
this
earliest
and
strongest
of
protections
is
gone
?
The
atavism
passed
and
he
walked
the
room
still
,
stopping
from
time
to
time
to
look
at
the
telegram
.
Holmes
was
formally
his
father
's
curate
but
actually
,
and
for
a
decade
,
rector
of
the
church
.
How
did
he
die
?
Of
old
age
--
he
was
seventy-five
.
He
had
lived
a
long
time
.
Dick
felt
sad
that
he
had
died
alone
--
he
had
survived
his
wife
,
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
;
there
were
cousins
in
Virginia
but
they
were
poor
and
not
able
to
come
North
,
and
Holmes
had
had
to
sign
the
telegram
.
Dick
loved
his
father
--
again
and
again
he
referred
judgments
to
what
his
father
would
probably
have
thought
or
done
.
Dick
was
born
several
months
after
the
death
of
two
young
sisters
and
his
father
,
guessing
what
would
be
the
effect
on
Dick
's
mother
,
had
saved
him
from
a
spoiling
by
becoming
his
moral
guide
.
He
was
of
tired
stock
yet
he
raised
himself
to
that
effort
.
In
the
summer
father
and
son
walked
downtown
together
to
have
their
shoes
shined
--
Dick
in
his
starched
duck
sailor
suit
,
his
father
always
in
beautifully
cut
clerical
clothes
--
and
the
father
was
very
proud
of
his
handsome
little
boy
.
He
told
Dick
all
he
knew
about
life
,
not
much
but
most
of
it
true
,
simple
things
,
matters
of
behavior
that
came
within
his
clergyman
's
range
.
``
Once
in
a
strange
town
when
I
was
first
ordained
,
I
went
into
a
crowded
room
and
was
confused
as
to
who
was
my
hostess
.
Several
people
I
knew
came
toward
me
,
but
I
disregarded
them
because
I
had
seen
a
gray-haired
woman
sitting
by
a
window
far
across
the
room
.
I
went
over
to
her
and
introduced
myself
.
After
that
I
made
many
friends
in
that
town
.
''
His
father
had
done
that
from
a
good
heart
--
his
father
had
been
sure
of
what
he
was
,
with
a
deep
pride
of
the
two
proud
widows
who
had
raised
him
to
believe
that
nothing
could
be
superior
to
``
good
instincts
,
''
honor
,
courtesy
,
and
courage
.
The
father
always
considered
that
his
wife
's
small
fortune
belonged
to
his
son
,
and
in
college
and
in
medical
school
sent
him
a
check
for
all
of
it
four
times
a
year
.
He
was
one
of
those
about
whom
it
was
said
with
smug
finality
in
the
gilded
age
:
``
very
much
the
gentleman
,
but
not
much
get-up-and-go
about
him
.
''
.
.
.
Dick
sent
down
for
a
newspaper
.
Still
pacing
to
and
from
the
telegram
open
on
his
bureau
,
he
chose
a
ship
to
go
to
America
.
Then
he
put
in
a
call
for
Nicole
in
Zurich
,
remembering
so
many
things
as
he
waited
,
and
wishing
he
had
always
been
as
good
as
he
had
intended
to
be
.
XIX
For
an
hour
,
tied
up
with
his
profound
reaction
to
his
father
's
death
,
the
magnificent
façade
of
the
homeland
,
the
harbor
of
New
York
,
seemed
all
sad
and
glorious
to
Dick
,
but
once
ashore
the
feeling
vanished
,
nor
did
he
find
it
again
in
the
streets
or
the
hotels
or
the
trains
that
bore
him
first
to
Buffalo
,
and
then
south
to
Virginia
with
his
father
's
body
.
Only
as
the
local
train
shambled
into
the
low-forested
clayland
of
Westmoreland
County
,
did
he
feel
once
more
identified
with
his
surroundings
;
at
the
station
he
saw
a
star
he
knew
,
and
a
cold
moon
bright
over
Chesapeake
Bay
;
he
heard
the
rasping
wheels
of
buckboards
turning
,
the
lovely
fatuous
voices
,
the
sound
of
sluggish
primeval
rivers
flowing
softly
under
soft
Indian
names
.
Next
day
at
the
churchyard
his
father
was
laid
among
a
hundred
Divers
,
Dorseys
,
and
Hunters
.
It
was
very
friendly
leaving
him
there
with
all
his
relations
around
him
.
Flowers
were
scattered
on
the
brown
unsettled
earth
.
Dick
had
no
more
ties
here
now
and
did
not
believe
he
would
come
back
.
He
knelt
on
the
hard
soil
.
These
dead
,
he
knew
them
all
,
their
weather-beaten
faces
with
blue
flashing
eyes
,
the
spare
violent
bodies
,
the
souls
made
of
new
earth
in
the
forest-heavy
darkness
of
the
seventeenth
century
.
``
Good-by
,
my
father
--
good-by
,
all
my
fathers
.
''
On
the
long-roofed
steamship
piers
one
is
in
a
country
that
is
no
longer
here
and
not
yet
there
.
The
hazy
yellow
vault
is
full
of
echoing
shouts
.
There
are
the
rumble
of
trucks
and
the
clump
of
trunks
,
the
strident
chatter
of
cranes
,
the
first
salt
smell
of
the
sea
.
One
hurries
through
,
even
though
there
's
time
;
the
past
,
the
continent
,
is
behind
;
the
future
is
the
glowing
mouth
in
the
side
of
the
ship
;
the
dim
,
turbulent
alley
is
too
confusedly
the
present
.
Up
the
gangplank
and
the
vision
of
the
world
adjusts
itself
,
narrows
.
One
is
a
citizen
of
a
commonwealth
smaller
than
Andorra
,
no
longer
sure
of
anything
.
The
men
at
the
purser
's
desk
are
as
oddly
shaped
as
the
cabins
;
disdainful
are
the
eyes
of
voyagers
and
their
friends
.
Next
the
loud
mournful
whistles
,
the
portentous
vibration
and
the
boat
,
the
human
idea
--
is
in
motion
.
The
pier
and
its
faces
slide
by
and
for
a
moment
the
boat
is
a
piece
accidentally
split
off
from
them
;
the
faces
become
remote
,
voiceless
,
the
pier
is
one
of
many
blurs
along
the
water
front
.
The
harbor
flows
swiftly
toward
the
sea
.
With
it
flowed
Albert
McKisco
,
labelled
by
the
newspapers
as
its
most
precious
cargo
.
McKisco
was
having
a
vogue
.
His
novels
were
pastiches
of
the
work
of
the
best
people
of
his
time
,
a
feat
not
to
be
disparaged
,
and
in
addition
he
possessed
a
gift
for
softening
and
debasing
what
he
borrowed
,
so
that
many
readers
were
charmed
by
the
ease
with
which
they
could
follow
him
.
Success
had
improved
him
and
humbled
him
.
He
was
no
fool
about
his
capacities
--
he
realized
that
he
possessed
more
vitality
than
many
men
of
superior
talent
,
and
he
was
resolved
to
enjoy
the
success
he
had
earned
.
``
I
've
done
nothing
yet
,
''
he
would
say
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
've
got
any
real
genius
.
But
if
I
keep
trying
I
may
write
a
good
book
.
''
Fine
dives
have
been
made
from
flimsier
spring-boards
.
The
innumerable
snubs
of
the
past
were
forgotten
.
Indeed
,
his
success
was
founded
psychologically
upon
his
duel
with
Tommy
Barban
,
upon
the
basis
of
which
,
as
it
withered
in
his
memory
,
he
had
created
,
afresh
,
a
new
self-respect
.
Spotting
Dick
Diver
the
second
day
out
,
he
eyed
him
tentatively
,
then
introduced
himself
in
a
friendly
way
and
sat
down
.
Dick
laid
aside
his
reading
and
,
after
the
few
minutes
that
it
took
to
realize
the
change
in
McKisco
,
the
disappearance
of
the
man
's
annoying
sense
of
inferiority
,
found
himself
pleased
to
talk
to
him
.
McKisco
was
``
well-informed
''
on
a
range
of
subjects
wider
than
Goethe
's
--
it
was
interesting
to
listen
to
the
innumerable
facile
combinations
that
he
referred
to
as
his
opinions
.
They
struck
up
an
acquaintance
,
and
Dick
had
several
meals
with
them
.
The
McKiscos
had
been
invited
to
sit
at
the
captain
's
table
but
with
nascent
snobbery
they
told
Dick
that
they
``
could
n't
stand
that
bunch
.
''
Violet
was
very
grand
now
,
decked
out
by
the
grand
couturières
,
charmed
about
the
little
discoveries
that
well-bred
girls
make
in
their
teens
.
She
could
,
indeed
,
have
learned
them
from
her
mother
in
Boise
but
her
soul
was
born
dismally
in
the
small
movie
houses
of
Idaho
,
and
she
had
had
no
time
for
her
mother
.
Now
she
``
belonged
''
--
together
with
several
million
other
people
--
and
she
was
happy
,
though
her
husband
still
shushed
her
when
she
grew
violently
naïve
.
The
McKiscos
got
off
at
Gibraltar
.
Next
evening
in
Naples
Dick
picked
up
a
lost
and
miserable
family
of
two
girls
and
their
mother
in
the
bus
from
the
hotel
to
the
station
.
He
had
seen
them
on
the
ship
.
An
overwhelming
desire
to
help
,
or
to
be
admired
,
came
over
him
:
he
showed
them
fragments
of
gaiety
;
tentatively
he
bought
them
wine
,
with
pleasure
saw
them
begin
to
regain
their
proper
egotism
.
He
pretended
they
were
this
and
that
,
and
falling
in
with
his
own
plot
,
and
drinking
too
much
to
sustain
the
illusion
,
and
all
this
time
the
women
,
thought
only
that
this
was
a
windfall
from
heaven
.
He
withdrew
from
them
as
the
night
waned
and
the
train
rocked
and
snorted
at
Cassino
and
Frosinone
.
After
weird
American
partings
in
the
station
at
Rome
,
Dick
went
to
the
Hotel
Quirinal
,
somewhat
exhausted
.
At
the
desk
he
suddenly
stared
and
upped
his
head
.
As
if
a
drink
were
acting
on
him
,
warming
the
lining
of
his
stomach
,
throwing
a
flush
up
into
his
brain
,
he
saw
the
person
he
had
come
to
see
,
the
person
for
whom
he
had
made
the
Mediterranean
crossing
.
Simultaneously
Rosemary
saw
him
,
acknowledging
him
before
placing
him
;
she
looked
back
startled
,
and
,
leaving
the
girl
she
was
with
,
she
hurried
over
.
Holding
himself
erect
,
holding
his
breath
,
Dick
turned
to
her
.
As
she
came
across
the
lobby
,
her
beauty
all
groomed
,
like
a
young
horse
dosed
with
Black-seed
oil
,
and
hoops
varnished
,
shocked
him
awake
;
but
it
all
came
too
quick
for
him
to
do
anything
except
conceal
his
fatigue
as
best
he
could
.
To
meet
her
starry-eyed
confidence
he
mustered
an
insincere
pantomime
implying
,
``
You
would
turn
up
here
--
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
.
''
Her
gloved
hands
closed
over
his
on
the
desk
;
``
Dick
--
we
're
making
The
Grandeur
that
was
Rome
--
at
least
we
think
we
are
;
we
may
quit
any
day
.
''
He
looked
at
her
hard
,
trying
to
make
her
a
little
self-conscious
,
so
that
she
would
observe
less
closely
his
unshaven
face
,
his
crumpled
and
slept-in
collar
.
Fortunately
,
she
was
in
a
hurry
.
``
We
begin
early
because
the
mists
rise
at
eleven
--
phone
me
at
two
.
''
In
his
room
Dick
collected
his
faculties
.
He
left
a
call
for
noon
,
stripped
off
his
clothes
and
dove
literally
into
a
heavy
sleep
.
He
slept
over
the
phone
call
but
awoke
at
two
,
refreshed
.
Unpacking
his
bag
,
he
sent
out
suits
and
laundry
.
He
shaved
,
lay
for
half
an
hour
in
a
warm
bath
and
had
breakfast
.
The
sun
had
dipped
into
the
Via
Nazionale
and
he
let
it
through
the
portières
with
a
jingling
of
old
brass
rings
.
Waiting
for
a
suit
to
be
pressed
,
he
discovered
from
the
Corriere
della
Sera
that
``
una
novella
di
Sinclair
Lewis
'Wall
Street
'
nella
quale
autore
analizza
la
vita
sociale
di
una
piccola
citta
Americana
.
''
Then
he
tried
to
think
about
Rosemary
.
At
first
he
thought
nothing
.
She
was
young
and
magnetic
,
but
so
was
Topsy
.
He
guessed
that
she
had
had
lovers
and
had
loved
them
in
the
last
four
years
.
Well
,
you
never
knew
exactly
how
much
space
you
occupied
in
people
's
lives
.
Yet
from
this
fog
his
affection
emerged
--
the
best
contacts
are
when
one
knows
the
obstacles
and
still
wants
to
preserve
a
relation
.
The
past
drifted
back
and
he
wanted
to
hold
her
eloquent
giving-of-herself
in
its
precious
shell
,
till
he
enclosed
it
,
till
it
no
longer
existed
outside
him
.
He
tried
to
collect
all
that
might
attract
her
--
it
was
less
than
it
had
been
four
years
ago
.
Eighteen
might
look
at
thirty-four
through
a
rising
mist
of
adolescence
;
but
twenty-two
would
see
thirty-eight
with
discerning
clarity
.
Moreover
,
Dick
had
been
at
an
emotional
peak
at
the
time
of
the
previous
encounter
;
since
then
there
had
been
a
lesion
of
enthusiasm
.
When
the
valet
returned
he
put
on
a
white
shirt
and
collar
and
a
black
tie
with
a
pearl
;
the
cords
of
his
reading-glasses
passed
through
another
pearl
of
the
same
size
that
swung
a
casual
inch
below
.
After
sleep
,
his
face
had
resumed
the
ruddy
brown
of
many
Riviera
summers
,
and
to
limber
himself
up
he
stood
on
his
hands
on
a
chair
until
his
fountain
pen
and
coins
fell
out
.
At
three
he
called
Rosemary
and
was
bidden
to
come
up
.
Momentarily
dizzy
from
his
acrobatics
,
he
stopped
in
the
bar
for
a
gin-and-tonic
.
``
Hi
,
Doctor
Diver
!
''
Only
because
of
Rosemary
's
presence
in
the
hotel
did
Dick
place
the
man
immediately
as
Collis
Clay
.
He
had
his
old
confidence
and
an
air
of
prosperity
and
big
sudden
jowls
.
``
Do
you
know
Rosemary
's
here
?
''
Collis
asked
.
``
I
ran
into
her
.
''
``
I
was
in
Florence
and
I
heard
she
was
here
so
I
came
down
last
week
.
You
'd
never
know
Mama
's
little
girl
.
''
He
modified
the
remark
,
``
I
mean
she
was
so
carefully
brought
up
and
now
she
's
a
woman
of
the
world
--
if
you
know
what
I
mean
.
Believe
me
,
has
she
got
some
of
these
Roman
boys
tied
up
in
bags
!
And
how
!
''
``
You
studying
in
Florence
?
''
``
Me
?
Sure
,
I
'm
studying
architecture
there
.
I
go
back
Sunday
--
I
'm
staying
for
the
races
.
''
With
difficulty
Dick
restrained
him
from
adding
the
drink
to
the
account
he
carried
in
the
bar
,
like
a
stock-market
report
.
XX
When
Dick
got
out
of
the
elevator
he
followed
a
tortuous
corridor
and
turned
at
length
toward
a
distant
voice
outside
a
lighted
door
.
Rosemary
was
in
black
pajamas
;
a
luncheon
table
was
still
in
the
room
;
she
was
having
coffee
.
``
You
're
still
beautiful
,
''
he
said
.
``
A
little
more
beautiful
than
ever
.
''
``
Do
you
want
coffee
,
youngster
?
''
``
I
'm
sorry
I
was
so
unpresentable
this
morning
.
''
``
You
did
n't
look
well
--
you
all
right
now
?
Want
coffee
?
''
``
No
,
thanks
.
''
``
You
're
fine
again
,
I
was
scared
this
morning
.
Mother
's
coming
over
next
month
,
if
the
company
stays
.
She
always
asks
me
if
I
've
seen
you
over
here
,
as
if
she
thought
we
were
living
next
door
.
Mother
always
liked
you
--
she
always
felt
you
were
some
one
I
ought
to
know
.
''
``
Well
,
I
'm
glad
she
still
thinks
of
me
.
''
``
Oh
,
she
does
,
''
Rosemary
reassured
him
.
``
A
very
great
deal
.
''
``
I
've
seen
you
here
and
there
in
pictures
,
''
said
Dick
.
``
Once
I
had
Daddy
's
Girl
run
off
just
for
myself
!
''
``
I
have
a
good
part
in
this
one
if
it
is
n't
cut
.
''
She
crossed
behind
him
,
touching
his
shoulder
as
she
passed
.
She
phoned
for
the
table
to
be
taken
away
and
settled
in
a
big
chair
.
``
I
was
just
a
little
girl
when
I
met
you
,
Dick
.
Now
I
'm
a
woman
.
''
``
I
want
to
hear
everything
about
you
.
''
``
How
is
Nicole
--
and
Lanier
and
Topsy
?
''
``
They
're
fine
.
They
often
speak
of
you
--
''
The
phone
rang
.
While
she
answered
it
Dick
examined
two
novels
--
one
by
Edna
Ferber
,
one
by
Albert
McKisco
.
The
waiter
came
for
the
table
;
bereft
of
its
presence
Rosemary
seemed
more
alone
in
her
black
pajamas
.
``
.
.
.
I
have
a
caller
.
.
.
.
No
,
not
very
well
.
I
've
got
to
go
to
the
costumer
's
for
a
long
fitting
.
.
.
.
No
,
not
now
.
.
.
''
As
though
with
the
disappearance
of
the
table
she
felt
released
,
Rosemary
smiled
at
Dick
--
that
smile
as
if
they
two
together
had
managed
to
get
rid
of
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
and
were
now
at
peace
in
their
own
heaven
.
.
.
``
That
's
done
,
''
she
said
.
``
Do
you
realize
I
've
spent
the
last
hour
getting
ready
for
you
?
''
But
again
the
phone
called
her
.
Dick
got
up
to
change
his
hat
from
the
bed
to
the
luggage
stand
,
and
in
alarm
Rosemary
put
her
hand
over
the
mouthpiece
of
the
phone
.
``
You
're
not
going
!
''
``
No
.
''
When
the
communication
was
over
he
tried
to
drag
the
afternoon
together
saying
:
``
I
expect
some
nourishment
from
people
now
.
''
``
Me
too
,
''
Rosemary
agreed
.
``
The
man
that
just
phoned
me
once
knew
a
second
cousin
of
mine
.
Imagine
calling
anybody
up
for
a
reason
like
that
!
''
Now
she
lowered
the
lights
for
love
.
Why
else
should
she
want
to
shut
off
his
view
of
her
?
He
sent
his
words
to
her
like
letters
,
as
though
they
left
him
some
time
before
they
reached
her
.
``
Hard
to
sit
here
and
be
close
to
you
,
and
not
kiss
you
.
''
Then
they
kissed
passionately
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
.
She
pressed
against
him
,
and
went
back
to
her
chair
.
It
could
not
go
on
being
merely
pleasant
in
the
room
.
Forward
or
backward
;
when
the
phone
rang
once
more
he
strolled
into
the
bedchamber
and
lay
down
on
her
bed
,
opening
Albert
McKisco
's
novel
.
Presently
Rosemary
came
in
and
sat
beside
him
.
``
You
have
the
longest
eyelashes
,
''
she
remarked
.
``
We
are
now
back
at
the
Junior
Prom
.
Among
those
present
are
Miss
Rosemary
Hoyt
,
the
eyelash
fancier
--
''
She
kissed
him
and
he
pulled
her
down
so
that
they
lay
side
by
side
,
and
then
they
kissed
till
they
were
both
breathless
.
Her
breathing
was
young
and
eager
and
exciting
.
Her
lips
were
faintly
chapped
but
soft
in
the
corners
.
When
they
were
still
limbs
and
feet
and
clothes
,
struggles
of
his
arms
and
back
,
and
her
throat
and
breasts
,
she
whispered
,
``
No
,
not
now
--
those
things
are
rhythmic
.
''
Disciplined
he
crushed
his
passion
into
a
corner
of
his
mind
,
but
bearing
up
her
fragility
on
his
arms
until
she
was
poised
half
a
foot
above
him
,
he
said
lightly
:
``
Darling
--
that
does
n't
matter
.
''
Her
face
had
changed
with
his
looking
up
at
it
;
there
was
the
eternal
moonlight
in
it
.
``
That
would
be
poetic
justice
if
it
should
be
you
,
''
she
said
.
She
twisted
away
from
him
,
walked
to
the
mirror
,
and
boxed
her
disarranged
hair
with
her
hands
.
Presently
she
drew
a
chair
close
to
the
bed
and
stroked
his
cheek
.
``
Tell
me
the
truth
about
you
,
''
he
demanded
.
``
I
always
have
.
''
``
In
a
way
--
but
nothing
hangs
together
.
''
They
both
laughed
but
he
pursued
.
``
Are
you
actually
a
virgin
?
''
``
No-o-o
!
''
she
sang
.
``
I
've
slept
with
six
hundred
and
forty
men
--
if
that
's
the
answer
you
want
.
''
``
It
's
none
of
my
business
.
''
``
Do
you
want
me
for
a
case
in
psychology
?
''
``
Looking
at
you
as
a
perfectly
normal
girl
of
twenty-two
,
living
in
the
year
nineteen
twenty-eight
,
I
guess
you
've
taken
a
few
shots
at
love
.
''
``
It
's
all
been
--
abortive
,
''
she
said
.
Dick
could
n't
believe
her
.
He
could
not
decide
whether
she
was
deliberately
building
a
barrier
between
them
or
whether
this
was
intended
to
make
an
eventual
surrender
more
significant
.
``
Let
's
go
walk
in
the
Pincio
,
''
he
suggested
.
He
shook
himself
straight
in
his
clothes
and
smoothed
his
hair
.
A
moment
had
come
and
somehow
passed
.
For
three
years
Dick
had
been
the
ideal
by
which
Rosemary
measured
other
men
and
inevitably
his
stature
had
increased
to
heroic
size
.
She
did
not
want
him
to
be
like
other
men
,
yet
here
were
the
same
exigent
demands
,
as
if
he
wanted
to
take
some
of
herself
away
,
carry
it
off
in
his
pocket
.
Walking
on
the
greensward
between
cherubs
and
philosophers
,
fauns
and
falling
water
,
she
took
his
arm
snugly
,
settling
into
it
with
a
series
of
little
readjustments
,
as
if
she
wanted
it
to
be
right
because
it
was
going
to
be
there
forever
.
She
plucked
a
twig
and
broke
it
,
but
she
found
no
spring
in
it
.
Suddenly
seeing
what
she
wanted
in
Dick
's
face
she
took
his
gloved
hand
and
kissed
it
.
Then
she
cavorted
childishly
for
him
until
he
smiled
and
she
laughed
and
they
began
having
a
good
time
.
``
I
ca
n't
go
out
with
you
to-night
,
darling
,
because
I
promised
some
people
a
long
time
ago
.
But
if
you
'll
get
up
early
I
'll
take
you
out
to
the
set
to-morrow
.
''
He
dined
alone
at
the
hotel
,
went
to
bed
early
,
and
met
Rosemary
in
the
lobby
at
half-past
six
.
Beside
him
in
the
car
she
glowed
away
fresh
and
new
in
the
morning
sunshine
.
They
went
out
through
the
Porta
San
Sebastiano
and
along
the
Appian
Way
until
they
came
to
the
huge
set
of
the
forum
,
larger
than
the
forum
itself
.
Rosemary
turned
him
over
to
a
man
who
led
him
about
the
great
props
;
the
arches
and
tiers
of
seats
and
the
sanded
arena
.
She
was
working
on
a
stage
which
represented
a
guard-room
for
Christian
prisoners
,
and
presently
they
went
there
and
watched
Nicotera
,
one
of
many
hopeful
Valentinos
,
strut
and
pose
before
a
dozen
female
``
captives
,
''
their
eyes
melancholy
and
startling
with
mascara
.
Rosemary
appeared
in
a
knee-length
tunic
.
``
Watch
this
,
''
she
whispered
to
Dick
.
``
I
want
your
opinion
.
Everybody
that
's
seen
the
rushes
says
--
''
``
What
are
the
rushes
?
''
``
When
they
run
off
what
they
took
the
day
before
.
They
say
it
's
the
first
thing
I
've
had
sex
appeal
in
.
''
``
I
do
n't
notice
it
.
''
``
You
would
n't
!
But
I
have
.
''
Nicotera
in
his
leopard
skin
talked
attentively
to
Rosemary
while
the
electrician
discussed
something
with
the
director
,
meanwhile
leaning
on
him
.
Finally
the
director
pushed
his
hand
off
roughly
and
wiped
a
sweating
forehead
,
and
Dick
's
guide
remarked
:
``
He
's
on
the
hop
again
,
and
how
!
''
``
Who
?
''
asked
Dick
,
but
before
the
man
could
answer
the
director
walked
swiftly
over
to
them
.
``
Who
's
on
the
hop
--
you
're
on
the
hop
yourself
.
''
He
spoke
vehemently
to
Dick
,
as
if
to
a
jury
.
``
When
he
's
on
the
hop
he
always
thinks
everybody
else
is
,
and
how
!
''
He
glared
at
the
guide
a
moment
longer
,
then
he
clapped
his
hands
:
``
All
right
--
everybody
on
the
set
.
''
It
was
like
visiting
a
great
turbulent
family
.
An
actress
approached
Dick
and
talked
to
him
for
five
minutes
under
the
impression
that
he
was
an
actor
recently
arrived
from
London
.
Discovering
her
mistake
she
scuttled
away
in
panic
.
The
majority
of
the
company
felt
either
sharply
superior
or
sharply
inferior
to
the
world
outside
,
but
the
former
feeling
prevailed
.
They
were
people
of
bravery
and
industry
;
they
were
risen
to
a
position
of
prominence
in
a
nation
that
for
a
decade
had
wanted
only
to
be
entertained
.
The
session
ended
as
the
light
grew
misty
--
a
fine
light
for
painters
,
but
,
for
the
camera
,
not
to
be
compared
with
the
clear
California
air
.
Nicotera
followed
Rosemary
to
the
car
and
whispered
something
to
her
--
she
looked
at
him
without
smiling
as
she
said
good-by
.
Dick
and
Rosemary
had
luncheon
at
the
Castelli
dei
Cæsari
,
a
splendid
restaurant
in
a
high-terraced
villa
overlooking
the
ruined
forum
of
an
undetermined
period
of
the
decadence
.
Rosemary
took
a
cocktail
and
a
little
wine
,
and
Dick
took
enough
so
that
his
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
left
him
.
Afterward
they
drove
back
to
the
hotel
,
all
flushed
and
happy
,
in
a
sort
of
exalted
quiet
.
She
wanted
to
be
taken
and
she
was
,
and
what
had
begun
with
a
childish
infatuation
on
a
beach
was
accomplished
at
last
.
XXI
Rosemary
had
another
dinner
date
,
a
birthday
party
for
a
member
of
the
company
.
Dick
ran
into
Collis
Clay
in
the
lobby
,
but
he
wanted
to
dine
alone
,
and
pretended
an
engagement
at
the
Excelsior
.
He
drank
a
cocktail
with
Collis
and
his
vague
dissatisfaction
crystallized
as
impatience
--
he
no
longer
had
an
excuse
for
playing
truant
to
the
clinic
.
This
was
less
an
infatuation
than
a
romantic
memory
.
Nicole
was
his
girl
--
too
often
he
was
sick
at
heart
about
her
,
yet
she
was
his
girl
.
Time
with
Rosemary
was
self-indulgence
--
time
with
Collis
was
nothing
plus
nothing
.
In
the
doorway
of
the
Excelsior
he
ran
into
Baby
Warren
.
Her
large
beautiful
eyes
,
looking
precisely
like
marbles
,
stared
at
him
with
surprise
and
curiosity
.
``
I
thought
you
were
in
America
,
Dick
!
Is
Nicole
with
you
?
''
``
I
came
back
by
way
of
Naples
.
''
The
black
band
on
his
arm
reminded
her
to
say
:
``
I
'm
so
sorry
to
hear
of
your
trouble
.
''
Inevitably
they
dined
together
.
``
Tell
me
about
everything
,
''
she
demanded
.
Dick
gave
her
a
version
of
the
facts
,
and
Baby
frowned
.
She
found
it
necessary
to
blame
some
one
for
the
catastrophe
in
her
sister
's
life
.
``
Do
you
think
Doctor
Dohmler
took
the
right
course
with
her
from
the
first
?
''
``
There
's
not
much
variety
in
treatment
any
more
--
of
course
you
try
to
find
the
right
personality
to
handle
a
particular
case
.
''
``
Dick
,
I
do
n't
pretend
to
advise
you
or
to
know
much
about
it
but
do
n't
you
think
a
change
might
be
good
for
her
--
to
get
out
of
that
atmosphere
of
sickness
and
live
in
the
world
like
other
people
?
''
``
But
you
were
keen
for
the
clinic
,
''
he
reminded
her
.
``
You
told
me
you
'd
never
feel
really
safe
about
her
--
''
``
That
was
when
you
were
leading
that
hermit
's
life
on
the
Riviera
,
up
on
a
hill
way
off
from
anybody
.
I
did
n't
mean
to
go
back
to
that
life
.
I
meant
,
for
instance
,
London
.
The
English
are
the
best-balanced
race
in
the
world
.
''
``
They
are
not
,
''
he
disagreed
.
``
They
are
.
I
know
them
,
you
see
.
I
meant
it
might
be
nice
for
you
to
take
a
house
in
London
for
the
spring
season
--
I
know
a
dove
of
a
house
in
Talbot
Square
you
could
get
,
furnished
.
I
mean
,
living
with
sane
,
well-balanced
English
people
.
''
She
would
have
gone
on
to
tell
him
all
the
old
propaganda
stories
of
1914
if
he
had
not
laughed
and
said
:
``
I
've
been
reading
a
book
by
Michael
Arlen
and
if
that
's
--
''
She
ruined
Michael
Arlen
with
a
wave
of
her
salad
spoon
.
``
He
only
writes
about
degenerates
.
I
mean
the
worthwhile
English
.
''
As
she
thus
dismissed
her
friends
they
were
replaced
in
Dick
's
mind
only
by
a
picture
of
the
alien
,
unresponsive
faces
that
peopled
the
small
hotels
of
Europe
.
``
Of
course
it
's
none
of
my
business
,
''
Baby
repeated
,
as
a
preliminary
to
a
further
plunge
,
``
but
to
leave
her
alone
in
an
atmosphere
like
that
--
''
``
I
went
to
America
because
my
father
died
.
''
``
I
understand
that
,
I
told
you
how
sorry
I
was
.
''
She
fiddled
with
the
glass
grapes
on
her
necklace
.
``
But
there
's
so
much
money
now
.
Plenty
for
everything
,
and
it
ought
to
be
used
to
get
Nicole
well
.
''
``
For
one
thing
I
ca
n't
see
myself
in
London
.
''
``
Why
not
?
I
should
think
you
could
work
there
as
well
as
anywhere
else
.
''
He
sat
back
and
looked
at
her
.
If
she
had
ever
suspected
the
rotted
old
truth
,
the
real
reason
for
Nicole
's
illness
,
she
had
certainly
determined
to
deny
it
to
herself
,
shoving
it
back
in
a
dusty
closet
like
one
of
the
paintings
she
bought
by
mistake
.
They
continued
the
conversation
in
the
Ulpia
,
where
Collis
Clay
came
over
to
their
table
and
sat
down
,
and
a
gifted
guitar
player
thrummed
and
rumbled
``
Suona
Fanfara
Mia
''
in
the
cellar
piled
with
wine
casks
.
``
It
's
possible
that
I
was
the
wrong
person
for
Nicole
,
''
Dick
said
.
``
Still
she
would
probably
have
married
some
one
of
my
type
,
some
one
she
thought
she
could
rely
on
--
indefinitely
.
''
``
You
think
she
'd
be
happier
with
somebody
else
?
''
Baby
thought
aloud
suddenly
.
``
Of
course
it
could
be
arranged
.
''
Only
as
she
saw
Dick
bend
forward
with
helpless
laughter
did
she
realize
the
preposterousness
of
her
remark
.
``
Oh
,
you
understand
,
''
she
assured
him
.
``
Do
n't
think
for
a
moment
that
we
're
not
grateful
for
all
you
've
done
.
And
we
know
you
've
had
a
hard
time
--
''
``
For
God
's
sake
,
''
he
protested
.
``
If
I
did
n't
love
Nicole
it
might
be
different
.
''
``
But
you
do
love
Nicole
?
''
she
demanded
in
alarm
.
Collis
was
catching
up
with
the
conversation
now
and
Dick
switched
it
quickly
:
``
Suppose
we
talk
about
something
else
--
about
you
,
for
instance
.
Why
do
n't
you
get
married
?
We
heard
you
were
engaged
to
Lord
Paley
,
the
cousin
of
the
--
''
``
Oh
,
no
.
''
She
became
coy
and
elusive
.
``
That
was
last
year
.
''
``
Why
do
n't
you
marry
?
''
Dick
insisted
stubbornly
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
One
of
the
men
I
loved
was
killed
in
the
war
,
and
the
other
one
threw
me
over
.
''
``
Tell
me
about
it
.
Tell
me
about
your
private
life
,
Baby
,
and
your
opinions
.
You
never
do
--
we
always
talk
about
Nicole
.
''
``
Both
of
them
were
Englishmen
.
I
do
n't
think
there
's
any
higher
type
in
the
world
than
a
first-rate
Englishman
,
do
you
?
If
there
is
I
have
n't
met
him
.
This
man
--
oh
,
it
's
a
long
story
.
I
hate
long
stories
,
do
n't
you
?
''
``
And
how
!
''
said
Collis
.
``
Why
,
no
--
I
like
them
if
they
're
good
.
''
``
That
's
something
you
do
so
well
,
Dick
.
You
can
keep
a
party
moving
by
just
a
little
sentence
or
a
saying
here
and
there
.
I
think
that
's
a
wonderful
talent
.
''
``
It
's
a
trick
,
''
he
said
gently
.
That
made
three
of
her
opinions
he
disagreed
with
.
``
Of
course
I
like
formality
--
I
like
things
to
be
just
so
,
and
on
the
grand
scale
.
I
know
you
probably
do
n't
but
you
must
admit
it
's
a
sign
of
solidity
in
me
.
''
Dick
did
not
even
bother
to
dissent
from
this
.
``
Of
course
I
know
people
say
,
Baby
Warren
is
racing
around
over
Europe
,
chasing
one
novelty
after
another
,
and
missing
the
best
things
in
life
,
but
I
think
on
the
contrary
that
I
'm
one
of
the
few
people
who
really
go
after
the
best
things
.
I
've
known
the
most
interesting
people
of
my
time
.
''
Her
voice
blurred
with
the
tinny
drumming
of
another
guitar
number
,
but
she
called
over
it
,
``
I
've
made
very
few
big
mistakes
--
''
``
--
Only
the
very
big
ones
,
Baby
.
''
She
had
caught
something
facetious
in
his
eye
and
she
changed
the
subject
.
It
seemed
impossible
for
them
to
hold
anything
in
common
.
But
he
admired
something
in
her
,
and
he
deposited
her
at
the
Excelsior
with
a
series
of
compliments
that
left
her
shimmering
.
Rosemary
insisted
on
treating
Dick
to
lunch
next
day
.
They
went
to
a
little
trattoria
kept
by
an
Italian
who
had
worked
in
America
,
and
ate
ham
and
eggs
and
waffles
.
Afterward
,
they
went
to
the
hotel
.
Dick
's
discovery
that
he
was
not
in
love
with
her
,
nor
she
with
him
,
had
added
to
rather
than
diminished
his
passion
for
her
.
Now
that
he
knew
he
would
not
enter
further
into
her
life
,
she
became
the
strange
woman
for
him
.
He
supposed
many
men
meant
no
more
than
that
when
they
said
they
were
in
love
--
not
a
wild
submergence
of
soul
,
a
dipping
of
all
colors
into
an
obscuring
dye
,
such
as
his
love
for
Nicole
had
been
.
Certain
thoughts
about
Nicole
,
that
she
should
die
,
sink
into
mental
darkness
,
love
another
man
,
made
him
physically
sick
.
Nicotera
was
in
Rosemary
's
sitting-room
,
chattering
about
a
professional
matter
.
When
Rosemary
gave
him
his
cue
to
go
,
he
left
with
humorous
protests
and
a
rather
insolent
wink
at
Dick
.
As
usual
the
phone
clamored
and
Rosemary
was
engaged
at
it
for
ten
minutes
,
to
Dick
's
increasing
impatience
.
``
Let
's
go
up
to
my
room
,
''
he
suggested
,
and
she
agreed
.
She
lay
across
his
knees
on
a
big
sofa
;
he
ran
his
fingers
through
the
lovely
forelocks
of
her
hair
.
``
Let
me
be
curious
about
you
again
?
''
he
asked
.
``
What
do
you
want
to
know
?
''
``
About
men
.
I
'm
curious
,
not
to
say
prurient
.
''
``
You
mean
how
long
after
I
met
you
?
''
``
Or
before
.
''
``
Oh
,
no
.
''
She
was
shocked
.
``
There
was
nothing
before
.
You
were
the
first
man
I
cared
about
.
You
're
still
the
only
man
I
really
care
about
.
''
She
considered
.
``
It
was
about
a
year
,
I
think
.
''
``
Who
was
it
?
''
``
Oh
,
a
man
.
''
He
closed
in
on
her
evasion
.
``
I
'll
bet
I
can
tell
you
about
it
:
the
first
affair
was
unsatisfactory
and
after
that
there
was
a
long
gap
.
The
second
was
better
,
but
you
had
n't
been
in
love
with
the
man
in
the
first
place
.
The
third
was
all
right
--
''
Torturing
himself
he
ran
on
.
``
Then
you
had
one
real
affair
that
fell
of
its
own
weight
,
and
by
that
time
you
were
getting
afraid
that
you
would
n't
have
anything
to
give
to
the
man
you
finally
loved
.
''
He
felt
increasingly
Victorian
.
``
Afterwards
there
were
half
a
dozen
just
episodic
affairs
,
right
up
to
the
present
.
Is
that
close
?
''
She
laughed
between
amusement
and
tears
.
``
It
's
about
as
wrong
as
it
could
be
,
''
she
said
,
to
Dick
's
relief
.
``
But
some
day
I
'm
going
to
find
somebody
and
love
him
and
love
him
and
never
let
him
go
.
''
Now
his
phone
rang
and
Dick
recognized
Nicotera
's
voice
,
asking
for
Rosemary
.
He
put
his
palm
over
the
transmitter
.
``
Do
you
want
to
talk
to
him
?
''
She
went
to
the
phone
and
jabbered
in
a
rapid
Italian
Dick
could
not
understand
.
``
This
telephoning
takes
time
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
after
four
and
I
have
an
engagement
at
five
.
You
better
go
play
with
Signor
Nicotera
.
''
``
Do
n't
be
silly
.
''
``
Then
I
think
that
while
I
'm
here
you
ought
to
count
him
out
.
''
``
It
's
difficult
.
''
She
was
suddenly
crying
.
``
Dick
,
I
do
love
you
,
never
anybody
like
you
.
But
what
have
you
got
for
me
?
''
``
What
has
Nicotera
got
for
anybody
?
''
``
That
's
different
.
''
--
Because
youth
called
to
youth
.
``
He
's
a
spic
!
''
he
said
.
He
was
frantic
with
jealousy
,
he
did
n't
want
to
be
hurt
again
.
``
He
's
only
a
baby
,
''
she
said
,
sniffling
.
``
You
know
I
'm
yours
first
.
''
In
reaction
he
put
his
arms
about
her
but
she
relaxed
wearily
backward
;
he
held
her
like
that
for
a
moment
as
in
the
end
of
an
adagio
,
her
eyes
closed
,
her
hair
falling
straight
back
like
that
of
a
girl
drowned
.
``
Dick
,
let
me
go
.
I
never
felt
so
mixed
up
in
my
life
.
''
He
was
a
gruff
red
bird
and
instinctively
she
drew
away
from
him
as
his
unjustified
jealousy
began
to
snow
over
the
qualities
of
consideration
and
understanding
with
which
she
felt
at
home
.
``
I
want
to
know
the
truth
,
''
he
said
.
``
Yes
,
then
.
We
're
a
lot
together
,
he
wants
to
marry
me
,
but
I
do
n't
want
to
.
What
of
it
?
What
do
you
expect
me
to
do
?
You
never
asked
me
to
marry
you
.
Do
you
want
me
to
play
around
forever
with
half-wits
like
Collis
Clay
?
''
``
You
were
with
Nicotera
last
night
?
''
``
That
's
none
of
your
business
,
''
she
sobbed
.
``
Excuse
me
,
Dick
,
it
is
your
business
.
You
and
Mother
are
the
only
two
people
in
the
world
I
care
about
.
''
``
How
about
Nicotera
?
''
``
How
do
I
know
?
''
She
had
achieved
the
elusiveness
that
gives
hidden
significance
to
the
least
significant
remarks
.
``
Is
it
like
you
felt
toward
me
in
Paris
?
''
``
I
feel
comfortable
and
happy
when
I
'm
with
you
.
In
Paris
it
was
different
.
But
you
never
know
how
you
once
felt
.
Do
you
?
''
He
got
up
and
began
collecting
his
evening
clothes
--
if
he
had
to
bring
all
the
bitterness
and
hatred
of
the
world
into
his
heart
,
he
was
not
going
to
be
in
love
with
her
again
.
``
I
do
n't
care
about
Nicotera
!
''
she
declared
.
``
But
I
've
got
to
go
to
Livorno
with
the
company
to-morrow
.
Oh
,
why
did
this
have
to
happen
?
''
There
was
a
new
flood
of
tears
.
``
It
's
such
a
shame
.
Why
did
you
come
here
?
Why
could
n't
we
just
have
the
memory
anyhow
?
I
feel
as
if
I
'd
quarrelled
with
Mother
.
''
As
he
began
to
dress
,
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
.
``
I
wo
n't
go
to
the
party
to-night
.
''
It
was
her
last
effort
.
``
I
'll
stay
with
you
.
I
do
n't
want
to
go
anyhow
.
''
The
tide
began
to
flow
again
,
but
he
retreated
from
it
.
``
I
'll
be
in
my
room
,
''
she
said
.
``
Good-by
,
Dick
.
''
``
Good-by
.
''
``
Oh
,
such
a
shame
,
such
a
shame
.
Oh
,
such
a
shame
.
What
's
it
all
about
anyhow
?
''
``
I
've
wondered
for
a
long
time
.
''
``
But
why
bring
it
to
me
?
''
``
I
guess
I
'm
the
Black
Death
,
''
he
said
slowly
.
``
I
do
n't
seem
to
bring
people
happiness
any
more
.
''
XXII
There
were
five
people
in
the
Quirinal
bar
after
dinner
,
a
high-class
Italian
frail
who
sat
on
a
stool
making
persistent
conversation
against
the
bartender
's
bored
:
``
Si
.
.
.
Si
.
.
.
Si
,
''
a
light
,
snobbish
Egyptian
who
was
lonely
but
chary
of
the
woman
,
and
the
two
Americans
.
Dick
was
always
vividly
conscious
of
his
surroundings
,
while
Collis
Clay
lived
vaguely
,
the
sharpest
impressions
dissolving
upon
a
recording
apparatus
that
had
early
atrophied
,
so
the
former
talked
and
the
latter
listened
,
like
a
man
sitting
in
a
breeze
.
Dick
,
worn
away
by
the
events
of
the
afternoon
,
was
taking
it
out
on
the
inhabitants
of
Italy
.
He
looked
around
the
bar
as
if
he
hoped
an
Italian
had
heard
him
and
would
resent
his
words
.
``
This
afternoon
I
had
tea
with
my
sister-in-law
at
the
Excelsior
.
We
got
the
last
table
and
two
men
came
up
and
looked
around
for
a
table
and
could
n't
find
one
.
So
one
of
them
came
up
to
us
and
said
,
'Is
n't
this
table
reserved
for
the
Princess
Orsini
?
'
and
I
said
:
'There
was
no
sign
on
it
,
'
and
he
said
:
'But
I
think
it
's
reserved
for
the
Princess
Orsini
.
'
I
could
n't
even
answer
him
.
''
``
What
'd
he
do
?
''
``
He
retired
.
''
Dick
switched
around
in
his
chair
.
``
I
do
n't
like
these
people
.
The
other
day
I
left
Rosemary
for
two
minutes
in
front
of
a
store
and
an
officer
started
walking
up
and
down
in
front
of
her
,
tipping
his
hat
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Collis
after
a
moment
.
``
I
'd
rather
be
here
than
up
in
Paris
with
somebody
picking
your
pocket
every
minute
.
''
He
had
been
enjoying
himself
,
and
he
held
out
against
anything
that
threatened
to
dull
his
pleasure
.
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
persisted
.
``
I
do
n't
mind
it
here
.
''
Dick
evoked
the
picture
that
the
few
days
had
imprinted
on
his
mind
,
and
stared
at
it
.
The
walk
toward
the
American
Express
past
the
odorous
confectioneries
of
the
Via
Nationale
,
through
the
foul
tunnel
up
to
the
Spanish
Steps
,
where
his
spirit
soared
before
the
flower
stalls
and
the
house
where
Keats
had
died
.
He
cared
only
about
people
;
he
was
scarcely
conscious
of
places
except
for
their
weather
,
until
they
had
been
invested
with
color
by
tangible
events
.
Rome
was
the
end
of
his
dream
of
Rosemary
.
A
bell-boy
came
in
and
gave
him
a
note
.
``
I
did
not
go
to
the
party
,
''
it
said
.
``
I
am
in
my
room
.
We
leave
for
Livorno
early
in
the
morning
.
''
Dick
handed
the
note
and
a
tip
to
the
boy
.
``
Tell
Miss
Hoyt
you
could
n't
find
me
.
''
Turning
to
Collis
he
suggested
the
Bonbonieri
.
They
inspected
the
tart
at
the
bar
,
granting
her
the
minimum
of
interest
exacted
by
her
profession
,
and
she
stared
back
with
bright
boldness
;
they
went
through
the
deserted
lobby
oppressed
by
draperies
holding
Victorian
dust
in
stuffy
folds
,
and
they
nodded
at
the
night
concierge
who
returned
the
gesture
with
the
bitter
servility
peculiar
to
night
servants
.
Then
in
a
taxi
they
rode
along
cheerless
streets
through
a
dank
November
night
.
There
were
no
women
in
the
streets
,
only
pale
men
with
dark
coats
buttoned
to
the
neck
,
who
stood
in
groups
beside
shoulders
of
cold
stone
.
``
My
God
!
''
Dick
sighed
.
``
What
's
a
matter
?
''
``
I
was
thinking
of
that
man
this
afternoon
:
'This
table
is
reserved
for
the
Princess
Orsini
.
'
Do
you
know
what
these
old
Roman
families
are
?
They
're
bandits
,
they
're
the
ones
who
got
possession
of
the
temples
and
palaces
after
Rome
went
to
pieces
and
preyed
on
the
people
.
''
``
I
like
Rome
,
''
insisted
Collis
.
``
Why
wo
n't
you
try
the
races
?
''
``
I
do
n't
like
races
.
''
``
But
all
the
women
turn
out
--
''
``
I
know
I
would
n't
like
anything
here
.
I
like
France
,
where
everybody
thinks
he
's
Napoleon
--
down
here
everybody
thinks
he
's
Christ
.
''
At
the
Bonbonieri
they
descended
to
a
panelled
cabaret
,
hopelessly
impermanent
amid
the
cold
stone
.
A
listless
band
played
a
tango
and
a
dozen
couples
covered
the
wide
floor
with
those
elaborate
and
dainty
steps
so
offensive
to
the
American
eye
.
A
surplus
of
waiters
precluded
the
stir
and
bustle
that
even
a
few
busy
men
can
create
;
over
the
scene
as
its
form
of
animation
brooded
an
air
of
waiting
for
something
,
for
the
dance
,
the
night
,
the
balance
of
forces
which
kept
it
stable
,
to
cease
.
It
assured
the
impressionable
guest
that
whatever
he
was
seeking
he
would
not
find
it
here
.
This
was
plain
as
plain
to
Dick
.
He
looked
around
,
hoping
his
eye
would
catch
on
something
,
so
that
spirit
instead
of
imagination
could
carry
on
for
an
hour
.
But
there
was
nothing
and
after
a
moment
he
turned
back
to
Collis
.
He
had
told
Collis
some
of
his
current
notions
,
and
he
was
bored
with
his
audience
's
short
memory
and
lack
of
response
.
After
half
an
hour
of
Collis
he
felt
a
distinct
lesion
of
his
own
vitality
.
They
drank
a
bottle
of
Italian
mousseaux
,
and
Dick
became
pale
and
somewhat
noisy
.
He
called
the
orchestra
leader
over
to
their
table
;
this
was
a
Bahama
Negro
,
conceited
and
unpleasant
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
row
.
``
You
asked
me
to
sit
down
.
''
``
All
right
.
And
I
gave
you
fifty
lire
,
did
n't
I
?
''
``
All
right
.
All
right
.
All
right
.
''
``
All
right
,
I
gave
you
fifty
lire
,
did
n't
I
?
Then
you
come
up
and
asked
me
to
put
some
more
in
the
horn
!
''
``
You
asked
me
to
sit
down
,
did
n't
you
?
Did
n't
you
?
''
``
I
asked
you
to
sit
down
but
I
gave
you
fifty
lire
,
did
n't
I
?
''
``
All
right
.
All
right
.
''
The
Negro
got
up
sourly
and
went
away
,
leaving
Dick
in
a
still
more
evil
humor
.
But
he
saw
a
girl
smiling
at
him
from
across
the
room
and
immediately
the
pale
Roman
shapes
around
him
receded
into
decent
,
humble
perspective
.
She
was
a
young
English
girl
,
with
blonde
hair
and
a
healthy
,
pretty
English
face
and
she
smiled
at
him
again
with
an
invitation
he
understood
,
that
denied
the
flesh
even
in
the
act
of
tendering
it
.
``
There
's
a
quick
trick
or
else
I
do
n't
know
bridge
,
''
said
Collis
.
Dick
got
up
and
walked
to
her
across
the
room
.
``
Wo
n't
you
dance
?
''
The
middle-aged
Englishman
with
whom
she
was
sitting
said
,
almost
apologetically
:
``
I
'm
going
out
soon
.
''
Sobered
by
excitement
Dick
danced
.
He
found
in
the
girl
a
suggestion
of
all
the
pleasant
English
things
;
the
story
of
safe
gardens
ringed
around
by
the
sea
was
implicit
in
her
bright
voice
and
as
he
leaned
back
to
look
at
her
,
he
meant
what
he
said
to
her
so
sincerely
that
his
voice
trembled
.
When
her
current
escort
should
leave
,
she
promised
to
come
and
sit
with
them
.
The
Englishman
accepted
her
return
with
repeated
apologies
and
smiles
.
Back
at
his
table
Dick
ordered
another
bottle
of
spumante
.
``
She
looks
like
somebody
in
the
movies
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
ca
n't
think
who
.
''
He
glanced
impatiently
over
his
shoulder
.
``
Wonder
what
's
keeping
her
?
''
``
I
'd
like
to
get
in
the
movies
,
''
said
Collis
thoughtfully
.
``
I
'm
supposed
to
go
into
my
father
's
business
but
it
does
n't
appeal
to
me
much
.
Sit
in
an
office
in
Birmingham
for
twenty
years
--
''
His
voice
resisted
the
pressure
of
materialistic
civilization
.
``
Too
good
for
it
?
''
suggested
Dick
.
``
No
,
I
do
n't
mean
that
.
''
``
Yes
,
you
do
.
''
``
How
do
you
know
what
I
mean
?
Why
do
n't
you
practise
as
a
doctor
,
if
you
like
to
work
so
much
?
''
Dick
had
made
them
both
wretched
by
this
time
,
but
simultaneously
they
had
become
vague
with
drink
and
in
a
moment
they
forgot
;
Collis
left
,
and
they
shook
hands
warmly
.
``
Think
it
over
,
''
said
Dick
sagely
.
``
Think
what
over
?
''
``
You
know
.
''
It
had
been
something
about
Collis
going
into
his
father
's
business
--
good
sound
advice
.
Clay
walked
off
into
space
.
Dick
finished
his
bottle
and
then
danced
with
the
English
girl
again
,
conquering
his
unwilling
body
with
bold
revolutions
and
stern
determined
marches
down
the
floor
.
The
most
remarkable
thing
suddenly
happened
.
He
was
dancing
with
the
girl
,
the
music
stopped
--
and
she
had
disappeared
.
``
Have
you
seen
her
?
''
``
Seen
who
?
''
``
The
girl
I
was
dancing
with
.
Su'nly
disappeared
.
Must
be
in
the
building
.
''
``
No
!
No
!
That
's
the
ladies
'
room
.
''
He
stood
up
by
the
bar
.
There
were
two
other
men
there
,
but
he
could
think
of
no
way
of
starting
a
conversation
.
He
could
have
told
them
all
about
Rome
and
the
violent
origins
of
the
Colonna
and
Gaetani
families
but
he
realized
that
as
a
beginning
that
would
be
somewhat
abrupt
.
A
row
of
Yenci
dolls
on
the
cigar
counter
fell
suddenly
to
the
floor
;
there
was
a
subsequent
confusion
and
he
had
a
sense
of
having
been
the
cause
of
it
,
so
he
went
back
to
the
cabaret
and
drank
a
cup
of
black
coffee
.
Collis
was
gone
and
the
English
girl
was
gone
and
there
seemed
nothing
to
do
but
go
back
to
the
hotel
and
lie
down
with
his
black
heart
.
He
paid
his
check
and
got
his
hat
and
coat
.
There
was
dirty
water
in
the
gutters
and
between
the
rough
cobblestones
;
a
marshy
vapor
from
the
Campagna
,
a
sweat
of
exhausted
cultures
tainted
the
morning
air
.
A
quartet
of
taxi-drivers
,
their
little
eyes
bobbing
in
dark
pouches
,
surrounded
him
.
One
who
leaned
insistently
in
his
face
he
pushed
harshly
away
.
``
Quanto
a
Hotel
Quirinal
?
''
``
Cento
lire
.
''
Six
dollars
.
He
shook
his
head
and
offered
thirty
lire
which
was
twice
the
day-time
fare
,
but
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
as
one
pair
,
and
moved
off
.
``
Trente-cinque
lire
e
mancie
,
''
he
said
firmly
.
``
Cento
lire
.
''
He
broke
into
English
.
``
To
go
half
a
mile
?
You
'll
take
me
for
forty
lire
.
''
``
Oh
,
no
.
''
He
was
very
tired
.
He
pulled
open
the
door
of
a
cab
and
got
in
.
``
Hotel
Quirinal
!
''
he
said
to
the
driver
who
stood
obstinately
outside
the
window
.
``
Wipe
that
sneer
off
your
face
and
take
me
to
the
Quirinal
.
''
``
Ah
,
no
.
''
Dick
got
out
.
By
the
door
of
the
Bonbonieri
some
one
was
arguing
with
the
taxi-drivers
,
some
one
who
now
tried
to
explain
their
attitude
to
Dick
;
again
one
of
the
men
pressed
close
,
insisting
and
gesticulating
and
Dick
shoved
him
away
.
``
I
want
to
go
to
the
Quirinal
Hotel
.
''
``
He
says
wan
huner
lire
,
''
explained
the
interpreter
.
``
I
understand
.
I
'll
give
him
fif'y
lire
.
Go
on
away
.
''
This
last
to
the
insistent
man
who
had
edged
up
once
more
.
The
man
looked
at
him
and
spat
contemptuously
.
The
passionate
impatience
of
the
week
leaped
up
in
Dick
and
clothed
itself
like
a
flash
in
violence
,
the
honorable
,
the
traditional
resource
of
his
land
;
he
stepped
forward
and
slapped
the
man
's
face
.
They
surged
about
him
,
threatening
,
waving
their
arms
,
trying
ineffectually
to
close
in
on
him
--
with
his
back
against
the
wall
Dick
hit
out
clumsily
,
laughing
a
little
and
for
a
few
minutes
the
mock
fight
,
an
affair
of
foiled
rushes
and
padded
,
glancing
blows
,
swayed
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
door
.
Then
Dick
tripped
and
fell
;
he
was
hurt
somewhere
but
he
struggled
up
again
wrestling
in
arms
that
suddenly
broke
apart
.
There
was
a
new
voice
and
a
new
argument
but
he
leaned
against
the
wall
,
panting
and
furious
at
the
indignity
of
his
position
.
He
saw
there
was
no
sympathy
for
him
but
he
was
unable
to
believe
that
he
was
wrong
.
They
were
going
to
the
police
station
and
settle
it
there
.
His
hat
was
retrieved
and
handed
to
him
,
and
with
some
one
holding
his
arm
lightly
he
strode
around
the
corner
with
the
taxi-men
and
entered
a
bare
barrack
where
carabinieri
lounged
under
a
single
dim
light
.
At
a
desk
sat
a
captain
,
to
whom
the
officious
individual
who
had
stopped
the
battle
spoke
at
length
in
Italian
,
at
times
pointing
at
Dick
,
and
letting
himself
be
interrupted
by
the
taxi-men
who
delivered
short
bursts
of
invective
and
denunciation
.
The
captain
began
to
nod
impatiently
.
He
held
up
his
hand
and
the
hydra-headed
address
,
with
a
few
parting
exclamations
,
died
away
.
Then
he
turned
to
Dick
.
``
Spick
Italiano
?
''
he
asked
.
``
No
.
''
``
Spick
Français
?
''
``
Oui
,
''
said
Dick
,
glowering
.
``
Alors
.
Écoute
.
Va
au
Quirinal
.
Espèce
d'endormi
.
Écoute
:
vous
êtes
saoûl
.
Payez
ce
que
le
chauffeur
demande
.
Comprenez-vous
?
''
Diver
shook
his
head
.
``
Non
,
je
ne
veux
pas
.
''
``
Come
?
''
``
Je
paierai
quarante
lires
.
C'est
bien
assez
.
''
The
captain
stood
up
.
``
Écoute
!
''
he
cried
portentously
.
``
Vous
êtes
saoûl
.
Vous
avez
battu
le
chauffeur
.
Comme
ci
,
comme
ça
.
''
He
struck
the
air
excitedly
with
right
hand
and
left
,
``
C'est
bon
que
je
vous
donne
la
liberté
.
Payez
ce
qu'il
a
dit
--
cento
lire
.
Va
au
Quirinal
.
''
Raging
with
humiliation
,
Dick
stared
back
at
him
.
``
All
right
.
''
He
turned
blindly
to
the
door
--
before
him
,
leering
and
nodding
,
was
the
man
who
had
brought
him
to
the
police
station
.
``
I
'll
go
home
,
''
he
shouted
,
``
but
first
I
'll
fix
this
baby
.
''
He
walked
past
the
staring
carabinieri
and
up
to
the
grinning
face
,
hit
it
with
a
smashing
left
beside
the
jaw
.
The
man
dropped
to
the
floor
.
For
a
moment
he
stood
over
him
in
savage
triumph
--
but
even
as
a
first
pang
of
doubt
shot
through
him
the
world
reeled
;
he
was
clubbed
down
,
and
fists
and
boots
beat
on
him
in
a
savage
tattoo
.
He
felt
his
nose
break
like
a
shingle
and
his
eyes
jerk
as
if
they
had
snapped
back
on
a
rubber
band
into
his
head
.
A
rib
splintered
under
a
stamping
heel
.
Momentarily
he
lost
consciousness
,
regained
it
as
he
was
raised
to
a
sitting
position
and
his
wrists
jerked
together
with
handcuffs
.
He
struggled
automatically
.
The
plainclothes
lieutenant
whom
he
had
knocked
down
,
stood
dabbing
his
jaw
with
a
handkerchief
and
looking
into
it
for
blood
;
he
came
over
to
Dick
,
poised
himself
,
drew
back
his
arm
and
smashed
him
to
the
floor
.
When
Doctor
Diver
lay
quite
still
a
pail
of
water
was
sloshed
over
him
.
One
of
his
eyes
opened
dimly
as
he
was
being
dragged
along
by
the
wrists
through
a
bloody
haze
and
he
made
out
the
human
and
ghastly
face
of
one
of
the
taxi-drivers
.
``
Go
to
the
Excelsior
hotel
,
''
he
cried
faintly
.
``
Tell
Miss
Warren
.
Two
hundred
lire
!
Miss
Warren
.
Due
centi
lire
!
Oh
,
you
dirty
--
you
God
--
''
Still
he
was
dragged
along
through
the
bloody
haze
,
choking
and
sobbing
,
over
vague
irregular
surfaces
into
some
small
place
where
he
was
dropped
upon
a
stone
floor
.
The
men
went
out
,
a
door
clanged
,
he
was
alone
.
XXIII
Until
one
o'clock
Baby
Warren
lay
in
bed
,
reading
one
of
Marion
Crawford
's
curiously
inanimate
Roman
stories
;
then
she
went
to
a
window
and
looked
down
into
the
street
.
Across
from
the
hotel
two
carabinieri
,
grotesque
in
swaddling
capes
and
harlequin
hats
,
swung
voluminously
from
this
side
and
that
,
like
mains'ls
coming
about
,
and
watching
them
she
thought
of
the
guards
'
officer
who
had
stared
at
her
so
intensely
at
lunch
.
He
had
possessed
the
arrogance
of
a
tall
member
of
a
short
race
,
with
no
obligation
save
to
be
tall
.
Had
he
come
up
to
her
and
said
:
``
Let
's
go
along
,
you
and
I
,
''
she
would
have
answered
:
``
Why
not
?
''
--
at
least
it
seemed
so
now
,
for
she
was
still
disembodied
by
an
unfamiliar
background
.
Her
thoughts
drifted
back
slowly
through
the
guardsman
to
the
two
carabinieri
,
to
Dick
--
she
got
into
bed
and
turned
out
the
light
.
A
little
before
four
she
was
awakened
by
a
brusque
knocking
.
``
Yes
--
what
is
it
?
''
``
It
's
the
concierge
,
Madame
.
''
She
pulled
on
her
kimono
and
faced
him
sleepily
.
``
Your
friend
name
Deever
he
's
in
trouble
.
He
had
trouble
with
the
police
,
and
they
have
him
in
the
jail
.
He
sent
a
taxi
up
to
tell
,
the
driver
says
that
he
promised
him
two
hundred
lire
.
''
He
paused
cautiously
for
this
to
be
approved
.
``
The
driver
says
Mr.
Deever
in
the
bad
trouble
.
He
had
a
fight
with
the
police
and
is
terribly
bad
hurt
.
''
``
I
'll
be
right
down
.
''
She
dressed
to
an
accompaniment
of
anxious
heartbeats
and
ten
minutes
later
stepped
out
of
the
elevator
into
the
dark
lobby
.
The
chauffeur
who
brought
the
message
was
gone
;
the
concierge
hailed
another
one
and
told
him
the
location
of
the
jail
.
As
they
rode
,
the
darkness
lifted
and
thinned
outside
and
Baby
's
nerves
,
scarcely
awake
,
cringed
faintly
at
the
unstable
balance
between
night
and
day
.
She
began
to
race
against
the
day
;
sometimes
on
the
broad
avenues
she
gained
but
whenever
the
thing
that
was
pushing
up
paused
for
a
moment
,
gusts
of
wind
blew
here
and
there
impatiently
and
the
slow
creep
of
light
began
once
more
.
The
cab
went
past
a
loud
fountain
splashing
in
a
voluminous
shadow
,
turned
into
an
alley
so
curved
that
the
buildings
were
warped
and
strained
following
it
,
bumped
and
rattled
over
cobblestones
,
and
stopped
with
a
jerk
where
two
sentry
boxes
were
bright
against
a
wall
of
green
damp
.
Suddenly
from
the
violet
darkness
of
an
archway
came
Dick
's
voice
,
shouting
and
screaming
.
``
Are
there
any
English
?
Are
there
any
Americans
?
Are
there
any
English
?
Are
there
any
--
oh
,
my
God
!
You
dirty
Wops
!
''
His
voice
died
away
and
she
heard
a
dull
sound
of
beating
on
the
door
.
Then
the
voice
began
again
.
``
Are
there
any
Americans
?
Are
there
any
English
?
''
Following
the
voice
she
ran
through
the
arch
into
a
court
,
whirled
about
in
momentary
confusion
and
located
the
small
guard-room
whence
the
cries
came
.
Two
carabinieri
started
to
their
feet
,
but
Baby
brushed
past
them
to
the
door
of
the
cell
.
``
Dick
!
''
she
called
.
``
What
's
the
trouble
?
''
``
They
've
put
out
my
eye
,
''
he
cried
.
``
They
handcuffed
me
and
then
they
beat
me
,
the
goddamn
--
the
--
''
Flashing
around
Baby
took
a
step
toward
the
two
carabinieri
.
``
What
have
you
done
to
him
?
''
she
whispered
so
fiercely
that
they
flinched
before
her
gathering
fury
.
``
Non
capisco
inglese
.
''
In
French
she
execrated
them
;
her
wild
,
confident
rage
filled
the
room
,
enveloped
them
until
they
shrank
and
wriggled
from
the
garments
of
blame
with
which
she
invested
them
.
``
Do
something
!
Do
something
!
''
``
We
can
do
nothing
until
we
are
ordered
.
''
``
Bene
.
Bay-nay
!
Bene
!
''
Once
more
Baby
let
her
passion
scorch
around
them
until
they
sweated
out
apologies
for
their
impotence
,
looking
at
each
other
with
the
sense
that
something
had
after
all
gone
terribly
wrong
.
Baby
went
to
the
cell
door
,
leaned
against
it
,
almost
caressing
it
,
as
if
that
could
make
Dick
feel
her
presence
and
power
,
and
cried
:
``
I
'm
going
to
the
Embassy
,
I
'll
be
back
.
''
Throwing
a
last
glance
of
infinite
menace
at
the
carabinieri
she
ran
out
.
She
drove
to
the
American
Embassy
where
she
paid
off
the
taxi-driver
upon
his
insistence
.
It
was
still
dark
when
she
ran
up
the
steps
and
pressed
the
bell
.
She
had
pressed
it
three
times
before
a
sleepy
English
porter
opened
the
door
to
her
.
``
I
want
to
see
some
one
,
''
she
said
.
``
Any
one
--
but
right
away
.
''
``
No
one
's
awake
,
Madame
.
We
do
n't
open
until
nine
o'clock
.
''
Impatiently
she
waved
the
hour
away
.
``
This
is
important
.
A
man
--
an
American
has
been
terribly
beaten
.
He
's
in
an
Italian
jail
.
''
``
No
one
's
awake
now
.
At
nine
o'clock
--
''
``
I
ca
n't
wait
.
They
've
put
out
a
man
's
eye
--
my
brother-in-law
,
and
they
wo
n't
let
him
out
of
jail
.
I
must
talk
to
some
one
--
ca
n't
you
see
?
Are
you
crazy
?
Are
you
an
idiot
,
you
stand
there
with
that
look
in
your
face
?
''
``
Hime
unable
to
do
anything
,
Madame
.
''
``
You
've
got
to
wake
some
one
up
!
''
She
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
and
jerked
him
violently
.
``
It
's
a
matter
of
life
and
death
.
If
you
wo
n't
wake
some
one
a
terrible
thing
will
happen
to
you
--
''
``
Kindly
do
n't
lay
hands
on
me
,
Madame
.
''
From
above
and
behind
the
porter
floated
down
a
weary
Groton
voice
.
``
What
is
it
there
?
''
The
porter
answered
with
relief
.
``
It
's
a
lady
,
sir
,
and
she
has
shook
me
.
''
He
had
stepped
back
to
speak
and
Baby
pushed
forward
into
the
hall
.
On
an
upper
landing
,
just
aroused
from
sleep
and
wrapped
in
a
white
embroidered
Persian
robe
,
stood
a
singular
young
man
.
His
face
was
of
a
monstrous
and
unnatural
pink
,
vivid
yet
dead
,
and
over
his
mouth
was
fastened
what
appeared
to
be
a
gag
.
When
he
saw
Baby
he
moved
his
head
back
into
a
shadow
.
``
What
is
it
?
''
he
repeated
.
Baby
told
him
,
in
her
agitation
edging
forward
to
the
stairs
.
In
the
course
of
her
story
she
realized
that
the
gag
was
in
reality
a
mustache
bandage
and
that
the
man
's
face
was
covered
with
pink
cold
cream
,
but
the
fact
fitted
quietly
into
the
nightmare
.
The
thing
to
do
,
she
cried
passionately
,
was
for
him
to
come
to
the
jail
with
her
at
once
and
get
Dick
out
.
``
It
's
a
bad
business
,
''
he
said
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
agreed
conciliatingly
.
``
Yes
?
''
``
This
trying
to
fight
the
police
.
''
A
note
of
personal
affront
crept
into
his
voice
,
``
I
'm
afraid
there
's
nothing
to
be
done
until
nine
o'clock
.
''
``
Till
nine
o'clock
,
''
she
repeated
aghast
.
``
But
you
can
do
something
,
certainly
!
You
can
come
to
the
jail
with
me
and
see
that
they
do
n't
hurt
him
any
more
.
''
``
We
are
n't
permitted
to
do
anything
like
that
.
The
Consulate
handles
these
things
.
The
Consulate
will
be
open
at
nine
.
''
His
face
,
constrained
to
impassivity
by
the
binding
strap
,
infuriated
Baby
.
``
I
ca
n't
wait
until
nine
.
My
brother-in-law
says
they
've
put
his
eye
out
--
he
's
seriously
hurt
!
I
have
to
get
to
him
.
I
have
to
find
a
doctor
.
''
She
let
herself
go
and
began
to
cry
angrily
as
she
talked
,
for
she
knew
that
he
would
respond
to
her
agitation
rather
than
her
words
.
``
You
've
got
to
do
something
about
this
.
It
's
your
business
to
protect
American
citizens
in
trouble
.
''
But
he
was
of
the
Eastern
seaboard
and
too
hard
for
her
.
Shaking
his
head
patiently
at
her
failure
to
understand
his
position
he
drew
the
Persian
robe
closer
about
him
and
came
down
a
few
steps
.
``
Write
down
the
address
of
the
Consulate
for
this
lady
,
''
he
said
to
the
porter
,
``
and
look
up
Doctor
Colazzo
's
address
and
telephone
number
and
write
that
down
too
.
''
He
turned
to
Baby
,
with
the
expression
of
an
exasperated
Christ
.
``
My
dear
lady
,
the
diplomatic
corps
represents
the
Government
of
the
United
States
to
the
Government
of
Italy
.
It
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
protection
of
citizens
,
except
under
specific
instructions
from
the
State
Department
.
Your
brother-in-law
has
broken
the
laws
of
this
country
and
been
put
in
jail
,
just
as
an
Italian
might
be
put
in
jail
in
New
York
.
The
only
people
who
can
let
him
go
are
the
Italian
courts
and
if
your
brother-in-law
has
a
case
you
can
get
aid
and
advice
from
the
Consulate
,
which
protects
the
rights
of
American
citizens
.
The
consulate
does
not
open
until
nine
o'clock
.
Even
if
it
were
my
brother
I
could
n't
do
anything
--
''
``
Can
you
phone
the
Consulate
?
''
she
broke
in
.
``
We
ca
n't
interfere
with
the
Consulate
.
When
the
Consul
gets
there
at
nine
--
''
``
Can
you
give
me
his
home
address
?
''
After
a
fractional
pause
the
man
shook
his
head
.
He
took
the
memorandum
from
the
porter
and
gave
it
to
her
.
``
Now
I
'll
ask
you
to
excuse
me
.
''
He
had
manoeuvred
her
to
the
door
:
for
an
instant
the
violet
dawn
fell
shrilly
upon
his
pink
mask
and
upon
the
linen
sack
that
supported
his
mustache
;
then
Baby
was
standing
on
the
front
steps
alone
.
She
had
been
in
the
embassy
ten
minutes
.
The
piazza
whereon
it
faced
was
empty
save
for
an
old
man
gathering
cigarette
butts
with
a
spiked
stick
.
Baby
caught
a
taxi
presently
and
went
to
the
Consulate
but
there
was
no
one
there
save
a
trio
of
wretched
women
scrubbing
the
stairs
.
She
could
not
make
them
understand
that
she
wanted
the
Consul
's
home
address
--
in
a
sudden
resurgence
of
anxiety
she
rushed
out
and
told
the
chauffeur
to
take
her
to
the
jail
.
He
did
not
know
where
it
was
,
but
by
the
use
of
the
words
semper
dritte
,
dextra
and
sinestra
she
manoeuvred
him
to
its
approximate
locality
,
where
she
dismounted
and
explored
a
labyrinth
of
familiar
alleys
.
But
the
buildings
and
the
alleys
all
looked
alike
.
Emerging
from
one
trail
into
the
Piazzo
d'Espagna
she
saw
the
American
Express
Company
and
her
heart
lifted
at
the
word
``
American
''
on
the
sign
.
There
was
a
light
in
the
window
and
hurrying
across
the
square
she
tried
the
door
,
but
it
was
locked
,
and
inside
the
clock
stood
at
seven
.
Then
she
thought
of
Collis
Clay
.
She
remembered
the
name
of
his
hotel
,
a
stuffy
villa
sealed
in
red
plush
across
from
the
Excelsior
.
The
woman
on
duty
at
the
office
was
not
disposed
to
help
her
--
she
had
no
authority
to
disturb
Mr.
Clay
,
and
refused
to
let
Miss
Warren
go
up
to
his
room
alone
;
convinced
finally
that
this
was
not
an
affair
of
passion
she
accompanied
her
.
Collis
lay
naked
upon
his
bed
.
He
had
come
in
tight
and
,
awakening
,
it
took
him
some
moments
to
realize
his
nudity
.
He
atoned
for
it
by
an
excess
of
modesty
.
Taking
his
clothes
into
the
bathroom
he
dressed
in
haste
,
muttering
to
himself
``
Gosh
.
She
certainly
musta
got
a
good
look
at
me
.
''
After
some
telephoning
,
he
and
Baby
found
the
jail
and
went
to
it
.
The
cell
door
was
open
and
Dick
was
slumped
on
a
chair
in
the
guard-room
.
The
carabinieri
had
washed
some
of
the
blood
from
his
face
,
brushed
him
and
set
his
hat
concealingly
upon
his
head
.
Baby
stood
in
the
doorway
trembling
.
``
Mr.
Clay
will
stay
with
you
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
want
to
get
the
Consul
and
a
doctor
.
''
``
All
right
.
''
``
Just
stay
quiet
.
''
``
All
right
.
''
``
I
'll
be
back
.
''
She
drove
to
the
Consulate
;
it
was
after
eight
now
,
and
she
was
permitted
to
sit
in
the
ante-room
.
Toward
nine
the
Consul
came
in
and
Baby
,
hysterical
with
impotence
and
exhaustion
,
repeated
her
story
.
The
Consul
was
disturbed
.
He
warned
her
against
getting
into
brawls
in
strange
cities
,
but
he
was
chiefly
concerned
that
she
should
wait
outside
--
with
despair
she
read
in
his
elderly
eye
that
he
wanted
to
be
mixed
up
as
little
as
possible
in
this
catastrophe
.
Waiting
on
his
action
,
she
passed
the
minutes
by
phoning
a
doctor
to
go
to
Dick
.
There
were
other
people
in
the
ante-room
and
several
were
admitted
to
the
Consul
's
office
.
After
half
an
hour
she
chose
the
moment
of
some
one
's
coming
out
and
pushed
past
the
secretary
into
the
room
.
``
This
is
outrageous
!
An
American
has
been
beaten
half
to
death
and
thrown
into
prison
and
you
make
no
move
to
help
.
''
``
Just
a
minute
,
Mrs
--
''
``
I
've
waited
long
enough
.
You
come
right
down
to
the
jail
and
get
him
out
!
''
``
Mrs
--
''
``
We
're
people
of
considerable
standing
in
America
--
''
Her
mouth
hardened
as
she
continued
.
``
If
it
was
n't
for
the
scandal
we
can
--
I
shall
see
that
your
indifference
to
this
matter
is
reported
in
the
proper
quarter
.
If
my
brother-in-law
were
a
British
citizen
he
'd
have
been
free
hours
ago
,
but
you
're
more
concerned
with
what
the
police
will
think
than
about
what
you
're
here
for
.
''
``
Mrs.
--
''
``
You
put
on
your
hat
and
come
with
me
right
away
.
''
The
mention
of
his
hat
alarmed
the
Consul
who
began
to
clean
his
spectacles
hurriedly
and
to
ruffle
his
papers
.
This
proved
of
no
avail
:
the
American
Woman
,
aroused
,
stood
over
him
;
the
clean-sweeping
irrational
temper
that
had
broken
the
moral
back
of
a
race
and
made
a
nursery
out
of
a
continent
,
was
too
much
for
him
.
He
rang
for
the
vice-consul
--
Baby
had
won
.
Dick
sat
in
the
sunshine
that
fell
profusely
through
the
guard-room
window
.
Collis
was
with
him
and
two
carabinieri
,
and
they
were
waiting
for
something
to
happen
.
With
the
narrowed
vision
of
his
one
eye
Dick
could
see
the
carabinieri
;
they
were
Tuscan
peasants
with
short
upper
lips
and
he
found
it
difficult
to
associate
them
with
the
brutality
of
last
night
.
He
sent
one
of
them
to
fetch
him
a
glass
of
beer
.
The
beer
made
him
light-headed
and
the
episode
was
momentarily
illumined
by
a
ray
of
sardonic
humor
.
Collis
was
under
the
impression
that
the
English
girl
had
something
to
do
with
the
catastrophe
,
but
Dick
was
sure
she
had
disappeared
long
before
it
happened
.
Collis
was
still
absorbed
by
the
fact
that
Miss
Warren
had
found
him
naked
on
his
bed
.
Dick
's
rage
had
retreated
into
him
a
little
and
he
felt
a
vast
criminal
irresponsibility
.
What
had
happened
to
him
was
so
awful
that
nothing
could
make
any
difference
unless
he
could
choke
it
to
death
,
and
,
as
this
was
unlikely
,
he
was
hopeless
.
He
would
be
a
different
person
henceforward
,
and
in
his
raw
state
he
had
bizarre
feelings
of
what
the
new
self
would
be
.
The
matter
had
about
it
the
impersonal
quality
of
an
act
of
God
.
No
mature
Aryan
is
able
to
profit
by
a
humiliation
;
when
he
forgives
it
has
become
part
of
his
life
,
he
has
identified
himself
with
the
thing
which
has
humiliated
him
--
an
upshot
that
in
this
case
was
impossible
.
When
Collis
spoke
of
retribution
,
Dick
shook
his
head
and
was
silent
.
A
lieutenant
of
carabinieri
,
pressed
,
burnished
,
vital
,
came
into
the
room
like
three
men
and
the
guards
jumped
to
attention
.
He
seized
the
empty
beer
bottle
and
directed
a
stream
of
scolding
at
his
men
.
The
new
spirit
was
in
him
,
and
the
first
thing
was
to
get
the
beer
bottle
out
of
the
guard-room
.
Dick
looked
at
Collis
and
laughed
.
The
vice-consul
,
an
over-worked
young
man
named
Swanson
,
arrived
,
and
they
started
to
the
court
;
Collis
and
Swanson
on
either
side
of
Dick
and
the
two
carabinieri
close
behind
.
It
was
a
yellow
,
hazy
morning
;
the
squares
and
arcades
were
crowded
and
Dick
,
pulling
his
hat
low
over
his
head
,
walked
fast
,
setting
the
pace
,
until
one
of
the
short-legged
carabinieri
ran
alongside
and
protested
.
Swanson
arranged
matters
.
``
I
've
disgraced
you
,
have
n't
I
?
''
said
Dick
jovially
.
``
You
're
liable
to
get
killed
fighting
Italians
,
''
replied
Swanson
sheepishly
.
``
They
'll
probably
let
you
go
this
time
but
if
you
were
an
Italian
you
'd
get
a
couple
of
months
in
prison
.
And
how
!
''
``
Have
you
ever
been
in
prison
?
''
Swanson
laughed
.
``
I
like
him
,
''
announced
Dick
to
Clay
.
``
He
's
a
very
likeable
young
man
and
he
gives
people
excellent
advice
,
but
I
'll
bet
he
's
been
to
jail
himself
.
Probably
spent
weeks
at
a
time
in
jail
.
''
Swanson
laughed
.
``
I
mean
you
want
to
be
careful
.
You
do
n't
know
how
these
people
are
.
''
``
Oh
,
I
know
how
they
are
,
''
broke
out
Dick
,
irritably
.
``
They
're
god
damn
stinkers
.
''
He
turned
around
to
the
carabinieri
:
``
Did
you
get
that
?
''
``
I
'm
leaving
you
here
,
''
Swanson
said
quickly
.
``
I
told
your
sister-in-law
I
would
--
our
lawyer
will
meet
you
upstairs
in
the
courtroom
.
You
want
to
be
careful
.
''
``
Good-by
.
''
Dick
shook
hands
politely
.
``
Thank
you
very
much
.
I
feel
you
have
a
future
--
''
With
another
smile
Swanson
hurried
away
,
resuming
his
official
expression
of
disapproval
.
Now
they
came
into
a
courtyard
on
all
four
sides
of
which
outer
stairways
mounted
to
the
chambers
above
.
As
they
crossed
the
flags
a
groaning
,
hissing
,
booing
sound
went
up
from
the
loiterers
in
the
courtyard
,
voices
full
of
fury
and
scorn
.
Dick
stared
about
.
``
What
's
that
?
''
he
demanded
,
aghast
.
One
of
the
carabinieri
spoke
to
a
group
of
men
and
the
sound
died
away
.
They
came
into
the
court-room
.
A
shabby
Italian
lawyer
from
the
Consulate
spoke
at
length
to
the
judge
while
Dick
and
Collis
waited
aside
.
Some
one
who
knew
English
turned
from
the
window
that
gave
on
the
yard
and
explained
the
sound
that
had
accompanied
their
passage
through
.
A
native
of
Frascati
had
raped
and
slain
a
five-year-old
child
and
was
to
be
brought
in
that
morning
--
the
crowd
had
assumed
it
was
Dick
.
In
a
few
minutes
the
lawyer
told
Dick
that
he
was
freed
--
the
court
considered
him
punished
enough
.
``
Enough
!
''
Dick
cried
.
``
Punished
for
what
?
''
``
Come
along
,
''
said
Collis
.
``
You
ca
n't
do
anything
now
.
''
``
But
what
did
I
do
,
except
get
into
a
fight
with
some
taxi-men
?
''
``
They
claim
you
went
up
to
a
detective
as
if
you
were
going
to
shake
hands
with
him
and
hit
him
--
''
``
That
's
not
true
!
I
told
him
I
was
going
to
hit
him
--
I
did
n't
know
he
was
a
detective
.
''
``
You
better
go
along
,
''
urged
the
lawyer
.
``
Come
along
.
''
Collis
took
his
arm
and
they
descended
the
steps
.
``
I
want
to
make
a
speech
,
''
Dick
cried
.
``
I
want
to
explain
to
these
people
how
I
raped
a
five-year-old
girl
.
Maybe
I
did
--
''
``
Come
along
.
''
Baby
was
waiting
with
a
doctor
in
a
taxi-cab
.
Dick
did
not
want
to
look
at
her
and
he
disliked
the
doctor
,
whose
stern
manner
revealed
him
as
one
of
that
least
palpable
of
European
types
,
the
Latin
moralist
.
Dick
summed
up
his
conception
of
the
disaster
,
but
no
one
had
much
to
say
.
In
his
room
in
the
Quirinal
the
doctor
washed
off
the
rest
of
the
blood
and
the
oily
sweat
,
set
his
nose
,
his
fractured
ribs
and
fingers
,
disinfected
the
smaller
wounds
and
put
a
hopeful
dressing
on
the
eye
.
Dick
asked
for
a
quarter
of
a
grain
of
morphine
,
for
he
was
still
wide
awake
and
full
of
nervous
energy
.
With
the
morphine
he
fell
asleep
;
the
doctor
and
Collis
left
and
Baby
waited
with
him
until
a
woman
could
arrive
from
the
English
nursing
home
.
It
had
been
a
hard
night
but
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
,
whatever
Dick
's
previous
record
was
,
they
now
possessed
a
moral
superiority
over
him
for
as
long
as
he
proved
of
any
use
.
BOOK
3
I
Frau
Kaethe
Gregorovius
overtook
her
husband
on
the
path
of
their
villa
.
``
How
was
Nicole
?
''
she
asked
mildly
;
but
she
spoke
out
of
breath
,
giving
away
the
fact
that
she
had
held
the
question
in
her
mind
during
her
run
.
Franz
looked
at
her
in
surprise
.
``
Nicole
's
not
sick
.
What
makes
you
ask
,
dearest
one
?
''
``
You
see
her
so
much
--
I
thought
she
must
be
sick
.
''
``
We
will
talk
of
this
in
the
house
.
''
Kaethe
agreed
meekly
.
His
study
was
over
in
the
administration
building
and
the
children
were
with
their
tutor
in
the
living-room
;
they
went
up
to
the
bedroom
.
``
Excuse
me
,
Franz
,
''
said
Kaethe
before
he
could
speak
.
``
Excuse
me
,
dear
,
I
had
no
right
to
say
that
.
I
know
my
obligations
and
I
am
proud
of
them
.
But
there
is
a
bad
feeling
between
Nicole
and
me
.
''
``
Birds
in
their
little
nests
agree
,
''
Franz
thundered
.
Finding
the
tone
inappropriate
to
the
sentiment
he
repeated
his
command
in
the
spaced
and
considered
rhythm
with
which
his
old
master
,
Doctor
Dohmler
,
could
cast
significance
on
the
tritest
platitude
.
``
Birds
--
in
--
their
--
nests
--
agree
!
''
``
I
realize
that
.
You
have
n't
seen
me
fail
in
courtesy
toward
Nicole
.
''
``
I
see
you
failing
in
common
sense
.
Nicole
is
half
a
patient
--
she
will
possibly
remain
something
of
a
patient
all
her
life
.
In
the
absence
of
Dick
I
am
responsible
.
''
He
hesitated
;
sometimes
as
a
quiet
joke
he
tried
to
keep
news
from
Kaethe
.
``
There
was
a
cable
from
Rome
this
morning
.
Dick
has
had
grippe
and
is
starting
home
to-morrow
.
''
Relieved
,
Kaethe
pursued
her
course
in
a
less
personal
tone
:
``
I
think
Nicole
is
less
sick
than
any
one
thinks
--
she
only
cherishes
her
illness
as
an
instrument
of
power
.
She
ought
to
be
in
the
cinema
,
like
your
Norma
Talmadge
--
that
's
where
all
American
women
would
be
happy
.
''
``
Are
you
jealous
of
Norma
Talmadge
,
on
a
film
?
''
``
I
do
n't
like
Americans
.
They
're
selfish
,
selfish
!
''
``
You
like
Dick
?
''
``
I
like
him
,
''
she
admitted
.
``
He
's
different
,
he
thinks
of
others
.
''
--
And
so
does
Norma
Talmadge
,
Franz
said
to
himself
.
Norma
Talmadge
must
be
a
fine
,
noble
woman
beyond
her
loveliness
.
They
must
compel
her
to
play
foolish
rôles
;
Norma
Talmadge
must
be
a
woman
whom
it
would
be
a
great
privilege
to
know
.
Kaethe
had
forgotten
about
Norma
Talmadge
,
a
vivid
shadow
that
she
had
fretted
bitterly
upon
one
night
as
they
were
driving
home
from
the
movies
in
Zurich.
``
--
Dick
married
Nicole
for
her
money
,
''
she
said
.
``
That
was
his
weakness
--
you
hinted
as
much
yourself
one
night
.
''
``
You
're
being
malicious
.
''
``
I
should
n't
have
said
that
,
''
she
retracted
.
``
We
must
all
live
together
like
birds
,
as
you
say
.
But
it
's
difficult
when
Nicole
acts
as
--
when
Nicole
pulls
herself
back
a
little
,
as
if
she
were
holding
her
breath
--
as
if
I
smelt
bad
!
''
Kaethe
had
touched
a
material
truth
.
She
did
most
of
her
work
herself
,
and
,
frugal
,
she
bought
few
clothes
.
An
American
shopgirl
,
laundering
two
changes
of
underwear
every
night
,
would
have
noticed
a
hint
of
yesterday
's
reawakened
sweat
about
Kaethe
's
person
,
less
a
smell
than
an
ammoniacal
reminder
of
the
eternity
of
toil
and
decay
.
To
Franz
this
was
as
natural
as
the
thick
dark
scent
of
Kaethe
's
hair
,
and
he
would
have
missed
it
equally
;
but
to
Nicole
,
born
hating
the
smell
of
a
nurse
's
fingers
dressing
her
,
it
was
an
offense
only
to
be
endured
.
``
And
the
children
,
''
Kaethe
continued
.
``
She
does
n't
like
them
to
play
with
our
children
--
''
but
Franz
had
heard
enough
:
``
Hold
your
tongue
--
that
kind
of
talk
can
hurt
me
professionally
,
since
we
owe
this
clinic
to
Nicole
's
money
.
Let
us
have
lunch
.
''
Kaethe
realized
that
her
outburst
had
been
ill-advised
,
but
Franz
's
last
remark
reminded
her
that
other
Americans
had
money
,
and
a
week
later
she
put
her
dislike
of
Nicole
into
new
words
.
The
occasion
was
the
dinner
they
tendered
the
Divers
upon
Dick
's
return
.
Hardly
had
their
footfalls
ceased
on
the
path
when
she
shut
the
door
and
said
to
Franz
:
``
Did
you
see
around
his
eyes
?
He
's
been
on
a
debauch
!
''
``
Go
gently
,
''
Franz
requested
.
``
Dick
told
me
about
that
as
soon
as
he
came
home
.
He
was
boxing
on
the
trans-Atlantic
ship
.
The
American
passengers
box
a
lot
on
these
trans-Atlantic
ships
.
''
``
I
believe
that
?
''
she
scoffed
.
``
It
hurts
him
to
move
one
of
his
arms
and
he
has
an
unhealed
scar
on
his
temple
--
you
can
see
where
the
hair
's
been
cut
away
.
''
Franz
had
not
noticed
these
details
.
``
But
what
?
''
Kaethe
demanded
.
``
Do
you
think
that
sort
of
thing
does
the
Clinic
any
good
?
The
liquor
I
smelt
on
him
tonight
,
and
several
other
times
since
he
's
been
back
.
''
She
slowed
her
voice
to
fit
the
gravity
of
what
she
was
about
to
say
:
``
Dick
is
no
longer
a
serious
man
.
''
Franz
rocked
his
shoulders
up
the
stairs
,
shaking
off
her
persistence
.
In
their
bedroom
he
turned
on
her
.
``
He
is
most
certainly
a
serious
man
and
a
brilliant
man
.
Of
all
the
men
who
have
recently
taken
their
degrees
in
neuropathology
in
Zurich
,
Dick
has
been
regarded
as
the
most
brilliant
--
more
brilliant
than
I
could
ever
be
.
''
``
For
shame
!
''
``
It
's
the
truth
--
the
shame
would
be
not
to
admit
it
.
I
turn
to
Dick
when
cases
are
highly
involved
.
His
publications
are
still
standard
in
their
line
--
go
into
any
medical
library
and
ask
.
Most
students
think
he
's
an
Englishman
--
they
do
n't
believe
that
such
thoroughness
could
come
out
of
America
.
''
He
groaned
domestically
,
taking
his
pajamas
from
under
the
pillow
,
``
I
ca
n't
understand
why
you
talk
this
way
,
Kaethe
--
I
thought
you
liked
him
.
''
``
For
shame
!
''
Kaethe
said
.
``
You
're
the
solid
one
,
you
do
the
work
.
It
's
a
case
of
hare
and
tortoise
--
and
in
my
opinion
the
hare
's
race
is
almost
done
.
''
``
Tch
!
Tch
!
''
``
Very
well
,
then
.
It
's
true
.
''
With
his
open
hand
he
pushed
down
air
briskly
.
``
Stop
!
''
The
upshot
was
that
they
had
exchanged
viewpoints
like
debaters
.
Kaethe
admitted
to
herself
that
she
had
been
too
hard
on
Dick
,
whom
she
admired
and
of
whom
she
stood
in
awe
,
who
had
been
so
appreciative
and
understanding
of
herself
.
As
for
Franz
,
once
Kaethe
's
idea
had
had
time
to
sink
in
,
he
never
after
believed
that
Dick
was
a
serious
person
.
And
as
time
went
on
he
convinced
himself
that
he
had
never
thought
so
.
II
Dick
told
Nicole
an
expurgated
version
of
the
catastrophe
in
Rome
--
in
his
version
he
had
gone
philanthropically
to
the
rescue
of
a
drunken
friend
.
He
could
trust
Baby
Warren
to
hold
her
tongue
,
since
he
had
painted
the
disastrous
effect
of
the
truth
upon
Nicole
.
All
this
,
however
,
was
a
low
hurdle
compared
to
the
lingering
effect
of
the
episode
upon
him
.
In
reaction
he
took
himself
for
an
intensified
beating
in
his
work
,
so
that
Franz
,
trying
to
break
with
him
,
could
find
no
basis
on
which
to
begin
a
disagreement
.
No
friendship
worth
the
name
was
ever
destroyed
in
an
hour
without
some
painful
flesh
being
torn
--
so
Franz
let
himself
believe
with
ever-increasing
conviction
that
Dick
travelled
intellectually
and
emotionally
at
such
a
rate
of
speed
that
the
vibrations
jarred
him
--
this
was
a
contrast
that
had
previously
been
considered
a
virtue
in
their
relation
.
So
,
for
the
shoddiness
of
needs
,
are
shoes
made
out
of
last
year
's
hide
.
Yet
it
was
May
before
Franz
found
an
opportunity
to
insert
the
first
wedge
.
Dick
came
into
his
office
white
and
tired
one
noon
and
sat
down
,
saying
:
``
Well
,
she
's
gone
.
''
``
She
's
dead
?
''
``
The
heart
quit
.
''
Dick
sat
exhausted
in
the
chair
nearest
the
door
.
During
three
nights
he
had
remained
with
the
scabbed
anonymous
woman-artist
he
had
come
to
love
,
formally
to
portion
out
the
adrenaline
,
but
really
to
throw
as
much
wan
light
as
he
could
into
the
darkness
ahead
.
Half
appreciating
his
feeling
,
Franz
travelled
quickly
over
an
opinion
:
``
It
was
neuro-syphilis
.
All
the
Wassermans
we
took
wo
n't
tell
me
differently
.
The
spinal
fluid
--
''
``
Never
mind
,
''
said
Dick
.
``
Oh
,
God
,
never
mind
!
If
she
cared
enough
about
her
secret
to
take
it
away
with
her
,
let
it
go
at
that
.
''
``
You
better
lay
off
for
a
day
.
''
``
Do
n't
worry
,
I
'm
going
to
.
''
Franz
had
his
wedge
;
looking
up
from
the
telegram
that
he
was
writing
to
the
woman
's
brother
he
inquired
:
``
Or
do
you
want
to
take
a
little
trip
?
''
``
Not
now
.
''
``
I
do
n't
mean
a
vacation
.
There
's
a
case
in
Lausanne
.
I
've
been
on
the
phone
with
a
Chilian
all
morning
--
''
``
She
was
so
damn
brave
,
''
said
Dick
.
``
And
it
took
her
so
long
.
''
Franz
shook
his
head
sympathetically
and
Dick
got
himself
together
.
``
Excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
.
''
``
This
is
just
a
change
--
the
situation
is
a
father
's
problem
with
his
son
--
the
father
ca
n't
get
the
son
up
here
.
He
wants
somebody
to
come
down
there
.
''
``
What
is
it
?
Alcoholism
?
Homosexuality
?
When
you
say
Lausanne
--
''
``
A
little
of
everything
.
''
``
I
'll
go
down
.
Is
there
any
money
in
it
?
''
``
Quite
a
lot
,
I
'd
say
.
Count
on
staying
two
or
three
days
,
and
get
the
boy
up
here
if
he
needs
to
be
watched
.
In
any
case
take
your
time
,
take
your
ease
;
combine
business
with
pleasure
.
''
After
two
hours
'
train
sleep
Dick
felt
renewed
,
and
he
approached
the
interview
with
Señor
Pardo
y
Cuidad
Real
in
good
spirits
.
These
interviews
were
much
of
a
type
.
Often
the
sheer
hysteria
of
the
family
representative
was
as
interesting
psychologically
as
the
condition
of
the
patient
.
This
one
was
no
exception
:
Señor
Pardo
y
Cuidad
Real
,
a
handsome
iron-gray
Spaniard
,
noble
of
carriage
,
with
all
the
appurtenances
of
wealth
and
power
,
raged
up
and
down
his
suite
in
the
Hôtel
de
Trois
Mondes
and
told
the
story
of
his
son
with
no
more
self-control
than
a
drunken
woman
.
``
I
am
at
the
end
of
my
invention
.
My
son
is
corrupt
.
He
was
corrupt
at
Harrow
,
he
was
corrupt
at
King
's
College
,
Cambridge
.
He
's
incorrigibly
corrupt
.
Now
that
there
is
this
drinking
it
is
more
and
more
obvious
how
he
is
,
and
there
is
continual
scandal
.
I
have
tried
everything
--
I
worked
out
a
plan
with
a
doctor
friend
of
mine
,
sent
them
together
for
a
tour
of
Spain
.
Every
evening
Francisco
had
an
injection
of
cantharides
and
then
the
two
went
together
to
a
reputable
bordello
--
for
a
week
or
so
it
seemed
to
work
but
the
result
was
nothing
.
Finally
last
week
in
this
very
room
,
rather
in
that
bathroom
--
''
he
pointed
at
it
,
``
--
I
made
Francisco
strip
to
the
waist
and
lashed
him
with
a
whip
--
''
Exhausted
with
his
emotion
he
sat
down
and
Dick
spoke
:
``
That
was
foolish
--
the
trip
to
Spain
was
futile
also
--
''
He
struggled
against
an
upsurging
hilarity
--
that
any
reputable
medical
man
should
have
lent
himself
to
such
an
amateurish
experiment
!
``
--
Señor
,
I
must
tell
you
that
in
these
cases
we
can
promise
nothing
.
In
the
case
of
the
drinking
we
can
often
accomplish
something
--
with
proper
co-operation
.
The
first
thing
is
to
see
the
boy
and
get
enough
of
his
confidence
to
find
whether
he
has
any
insight
into
the
matter
.
''
--
The
boy
,
with
whom
he
sat
on
the
terrace
,
was
about
twenty
,
handsome
and
alert
.
``
I
'd
like
to
know
your
attitude
,
''
Dick
said
.
``
Do
you
feel
that
the
situation
is
getting
worse
?
And
do
you
want
to
do
anything
about
it
?
''
``
I
suppose
I
do
,
''
said
Francisco
,
``
I
am
very
unhappy
.
''
``
Do
you
think
it
's
from
the
drinking
or
from
the
abnormality
?
''
``
I
think
the
drinking
is
caused
by
the
other
.
''
He
was
serious
for
a
while
--
suddenly
an
irrepressible
facetiousness
broke
through
and
he
laughed
,
saying
,
``
It
's
hopeless
.
At
King
's
I
was
known
as
the
Queen
of
Chili
.
That
trip
to
Spain
--
all
it
did
was
to
make
me
nauseated
by
the
sight
of
a
woman
.
''
Dick
caught
him
up
sharply
.
``
If
you
're
happy
in
this
mess
,
then
I
ca
n't
help
you
and
I
'm
wasting
my
time
.
''
``
No
,
let
's
talk
--
I
despise
most
of
the
others
so
.
''
There
was
some
manliness
in
the
boy
,
perverted
now
into
an
active
resistance
to
his
father
.
But
he
had
that
typically
roguish
look
in
his
eyes
that
homosexuals
assume
in
discussing
the
subject
.
``
It
's
a
hole-and-corner
business
at
best
,
''
Dick
told
him
.
``
You
'll
spend
your
life
on
it
,
and
its
consequences
,
and
you
wo
n't
have
time
or
energy
for
any
other
decent
or
social
act
.
If
you
want
to
face
the
world
you
'll
have
to
begin
by
controlling
your
sensuality
--
and
,
first
of
all
,
the
drinking
that
provokes
it
--
''
He
talked
automatically
,
having
abandoned
the
case
ten
minutes
before
.
They
talked
pleasantly
through
another
hour
about
the
boy
's
home
in
Chili
and
about
his
ambitions
.
It
was
as
close
as
Dick
had
ever
come
to
comprehending
such
a
character
from
any
but
the
pathological
angle
--
he
gathered
that
this
very
charm
made
it
possible
for
Francisco
to
perpetrate
his
outrages
,
and
,
for
Dick
,
charm
always
had
an
independent
existence
,
whether
it
was
the
mad
gallantry
of
the
wretch
who
had
died
in
the
clinic
this
morning
,
or
the
courageous
grace
which
this
lost
young
man
brought
to
a
drab
old
story
.
Dick
tried
to
dissect
it
into
pieces
small
enough
to
store
away
--
realizing
that
the
totality
of
a
life
may
be
different
in
quality
from
its
segments
,
and
also
that
life
during
the
forties
seemed
capable
of
being
observed
only
in
segments
.
His
love
for
Nicole
and
Rosemary
,
his
friendship
with
Abe
North
,
with
Tommy
Barban
in
the
broken
universe
of
the
war
's
ending
--
in
such
contacts
the
personalities
had
seemed
to
press
up
so
close
to
him
that
he
became
the
personality
itself
--
there
seemed
some
necessity
of
taking
all
or
nothing
;
it
was
as
if
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
he
was
condemned
to
carry
with
him
the
egos
of
certain
people
,
early
met
and
early
loved
,
and
to
be
only
as
complete
as
they
were
complete
themselves
.
There
was
some
element
of
loneliness
involved
--
so
easy
to
be
loved
--
so
hard
to
love
.
As
he
sat
on
the
veranda
with
young
Francisco
,
a
ghost
of
the
past
swam
into
his
ken
.
A
tall
,
singularly
swaying
male
detached
himself
from
the
shrubbery
and
approached
Dick
and
Francisco
with
feeble
resolution
.
For
a
moment
he
formed
such
an
apologetic
part
of
the
vibrant
landscape
that
Dick
scarcely
remarked
him
--
then
Dick
was
on
his
feet
,
shaking
hands
with
an
abstracted
air
,
thinking
,
``
My
God
,
I
've
stirred
up
a
nest
!
''
and
trying
to
collect
the
man
's
name
.
``
This
is
Doctor
Diver
,
is
n't
it
?
''
``
Well
,
well
--
Mr.
Dumphry
,
is
n't
it
?
''
``
Royal
Dumphry
.
I
had
the
pleasure
of
having
dinner
one
night
in
that
lovely
garden
of
yours
.
''
``
Of
course
.
''
Trying
to
dampen
Mr.
Dumphry
's
enthusiasm
,
Dick
went
into
impersonal
chronology
.
``
It
was
in
nineteen
--
twenty-four
--
or
twenty-five
--
''
He
had
remained
standing
,
but
Royal
Dumphry
,
shy
as
he
had
seemed
at
first
,
was
no
laggard
with
his
pick
and
spade
;
he
spoke
to
Francisco
in
a
flip
,
intimate
manner
,
but
the
latter
,
ashamed
of
him
,
joined
Dick
in
trying
to
freeze
him
away
.
``
Doctor
Diver
--
one
thing
I
want
to
say
before
you
go
.
I
've
never
forgotten
that
evening
in
your
garden
--
how
nice
you
and
your
wife
were
.
To
me
it
's
one
of
the
finest
memories
in
my
life
,
one
of
the
happiest
ones
.
I
've
always
thought
of
it
as
the
most
civilized
gathering
of
people
that
I
have
ever
known
.
''
Dick
continued
a
crab-like
retreat
toward
the
nearest
door
of
the
hotel
.
``
I
'm
glad
you
remembered
it
so
pleasantly
.
Now
I
've
got
to
see
--
''
``
I
understand
,
''
Royal
Dumphry
pursued
sympathetically
.
``
I
hear
he
's
dying
.
''
``
Who
's
dying
?
''
``
Perhaps
I
should
n't
have
said
that
--
but
we
have
the
same
physician
.
''
Dick
paused
,
regarding
him
in
astonishment
.
``
Who
're
you
talking
about
?
''
``
Why
,
your
wife
's
father
--
perhaps
I
--
''
``
My
what
?
''
``
I
suppose
--
you
mean
I
'm
the
first
person
--
''
``
You
mean
my
wife
's
father
is
here
,
in
Lausanne
?
''
``
Why
,
I
thought
you
knew
--
I
thought
that
was
why
you
were
here
.
''
``
What
doctor
is
taking
care
of
him
?
''
Dick
scrawled
the
name
in
a
notebook
,
excused
himself
,
and
hurried
to
a
telephone
booth
.
It
was
convenient
for
Doctor
Dangeu
to
see
Doctor
Diver
at
his
house
immediately
.
Doctor
Dangeu
was
a
young
Génevois
;
for
a
moment
he
was
afraid
that
he
was
going
to
lose
a
profitable
patient
,
but
,
when
Dick
reassured
him
,
he
divulged
the
fact
that
Mr.
Warren
was
indeed
dying
.
``
He
is
only
fifty
but
the
liver
has
stopped
restoring
itself
;
the
precipitating
factor
is
alcoholism
.
''
``
Does
n't
respond
?
''
``
The
man
can
take
nothing
except
liquids
--
I
give
him
three
days
,
or
at
most
,
a
week
.
''
``
Does
his
elder
daughter
,
Miss
Warren
,
know
his
condition
?
''
``
By
his
own
wish
no
one
knows
except
the
man-servant
.
It
was
only
this
morning
I
felt
I
had
to
tell
him
--
he
took
it
excitedly
,
although
he
has
been
in
a
very
religious
and
resigned
mood
from
the
beginning
of
his
illness
.
''
Dick
considered
:
``
Well
--
''
he
decided
slowly
,
``
in
any
case
I
'll
take
care
of
the
family
angle
.
But
I
imagine
they
would
want
a
consultation
.
''
``
As
you
like
.
''
``
I
know
I
speak
for
them
when
I
ask
you
to
call
in
one
of
the
best-known
medicine
men
around
the
lake
--
Herbrugge
,
from
Geneva
.
''
``
I
was
thinking
of
Herbrugge
.
''
``
Meanwhile
I
'm
here
for
a
day
at
least
and
I
'll
keep
in
touch
with
you
.
''
That
evening
Dick
went
to
Señor
Pardo
y
Cuidad
Real
and
they
talked
.
``
We
have
large
estates
in
Chili
--
''
said
the
old
man
.
``
My
son
could
well
be
taking
care
of
them
.
Or
I
can
get
him
in
any
one
of
a
dozen
enterprises
in
Paris
--
''
He
shook
his
head
and
paced
across
the
windows
against
a
spring
rain
so
cheerful
that
it
did
n't
even
drive
the
swans
to
cover
,
``
My
only
son
!
Ca
n't
you
take
him
with
you
?
''
The
Spaniard
knelt
suddenly
at
Dick
's
feet
.
``
Ca
n't
you
cure
my
only
son
?
I
believe
in
you
--
you
can
take
him
with
you
,
cure
him
.
''
``
It
's
impossible
to
commit
a
person
on
such
grounds
.
I
would
n't
if
I
could
.
''
The
Spaniard
got
up
from
his
knees
.
``
I
have
been
hasty
--
I
have
been
driven
--
''
Descending
to
the
lobby
Dick
met
Doctor
Dangeu
in
the
elevator
.
``
I
was
about
to
call
your
room
,
''
the
latter
said
.
``
Can
we
speak
out
on
the
terrace
?
''
``
Is
Mr.
Warren
dead
?
''
Dick
demanded
.
``
He
is
the
same
--
the
consultation
is
in
the
morning
.
Meanwhile
he
wants
to
see
his
daughter
--
your
wife
--
with
the
greatest
fervor
.
It
seems
there
was
some
quarrel
--
''
``
I
know
all
about
that
.
''
The
doctors
looked
at
each
other
,
thinking
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
talk
to
him
before
you
make
up
your
mind
?
''
Dangeu
suggested
.
``
His
death
will
be
graceful
--
merely
a
weakening
and
sinking
.
''
With
an
effort
Dick
consented
.
``
All
right
.
''
The
suite
in
which
Devereux
Warren
was
gracefully
weakening
and
sinking
was
of
the
same
size
as
that
of
the
Señor
Pardo
y
Cuidad
Real
--
throughout
this
hotel
there
were
many
chambers
wherein
rich
ruins
,
fugitives
from
justice
,
claimants
to
the
thrones
of
mediatized
principalities
,
lived
on
the
derivatives
of
opium
or
barbitol
listening
eternally
as
to
an
inescapable
radio
,
to
the
coarse
melodies
of
old
sins
.
This
corner
of
Europe
does
not
so
much
draw
people
as
accept
them
without
inconvenient
questions
.
Routes
cross
here
--
people
bound
for
private
sanitariums
or
tuberculosis
resorts
in
the
mountains
,
people
who
are
no
longer
persona
gratis
in
France
or
Italy
.
The
suite
was
darkened
.
A
nun
with
a
holy
face
was
nursing
the
man
whose
emaciated
fingers
stirred
a
rosary
on
the
white
sheet
.
He
was
still
handsome
and
his
voice
summoned
up
a
thick
burr
of
individuality
as
he
spoke
to
Dick
,
after
Dangeu
had
left
them
together
.
``
We
get
a
lot
of
understanding
at
the
end
of
life
.
Only
now
,
Doctor
Diver
,
do
I
realize
what
it
was
all
about
.
''
Dick
waited
.
``
I
've
been
a
bad
man
.
You
must
know
how
little
right
I
have
to
see
Nicole
again
,
yet
a
Bigger
Man
than
either
of
us
says
to
forgive
and
to
pity
.
''
The
rosary
slipped
from
his
weak
hands
and
slid
off
the
smooth
bed
covers
.
Dick
picked
it
up
for
him
.
``
If
I
could
see
Nicole
for
ten
minutes
I
would
go
happy
out
of
the
world
.
''
``
It
's
not
a
decision
I
can
make
for
myself
,
''
said
Dick
.
``
Nicole
is
not
strong
.
''
He
made
his
decision
but
pretended
to
hesitate
.
``
I
can
put
it
up
to
my
professional
associate
.
''
``
What
your
associate
says
goes
with
me
--
very
well
,
Doctor
.
Let
me
tell
you
my
debt
to
you
is
so
large
--
''
Dick
stood
up
quickly
.
``
I
'll
let
you
know
the
result
through
Doctor
Dangeu
.
''
In
his
room
he
called
the
clinic
on
the
Zugersee
.
After
a
long
time
Kaethe
answered
from
her
own
house
.
``
I
want
to
get
in
touch
with
Franz
.
''
``
Franz
is
up
on
the
mountain
.
I
'm
going
up
myself
--
is
it
something
I
can
tell
him
,
Dick
?
''
``
It
's
about
Nicole
--
her
father
is
dying
here
in
Lausanne
.
Tell
Franz
that
,
to
show
him
it
's
important
;
and
ask
him
to
phone
me
from
up
there
.
''
``
I
will
.
''
``
Tell
him
I
'll
be
in
my
room
here
at
the
hotel
from
three
to
five
,
and
again
from
seven
to
eight
,
and
after
that
to
page
me
in
the
dining-room
.
''
In
plotting
these
hours
he
forgot
to
add
that
Nicole
was
not
to
be
told
;
when
he
remembered
it
he
was
talking
into
a
dead
telephone
.
Certainly
Kaethe
should
realize
.
.
.
.
Kaethe
had
no
exact
intention
of
telling
Nicole
about
the
call
when
she
rode
up
the
deserted
hill
of
mountain
wild-flowers
and
secret
winds
,
where
the
patients
were
taken
to
ski
in
winter
and
to
climb
in
spring
.
Getting
off
the
train
she
saw
Nicole
shepherding
the
children
through
some
organized
romp
.
Approaching
,
she
drew
her
arm
gently
along
Nicole
's
shoulder
,
saying
:
``
You
are
clever
with
children
--
you
must
teach
them
more
about
swimming
in
the
summer
.
''
In
the
play
they
had
grown
hot
,
and
Nicole
's
reflex
in
drawing
away
from
Kaethe
's
arm
was
automatic
to
the
point
of
rudeness
.
Kaethe
's
hand
fell
awkwardly
into
space
,
and
then
she
too
reacted
,
verbally
,
and
deplorably
.
``
Did
you
think
I
was
going
to
embrace
you
?
''
she
demanded
sharply
.
``
It
was
only
about
Dick
,
I
talked
on
the
phone
to
him
and
I
was
sorry
--
''
``
Is
anything
the
matter
with
Dick
?
''
Kaethe
suddenly
realized
her
error
,
but
she
had
taken
a
tactless
course
and
there
was
no
choice
but
to
answer
as
Nicole
pursued
her
with
reiterated
questions
:
``
.
.
.
then
why
were
you
sorry
?
''
``
Nothing
about
Dick
.
I
must
talk
to
Franz
.
''
``
It
is
about
Dick
.
''
There
was
terror
in
her
face
and
collaborating
alarm
in
the
faces
of
the
Diver
children
,
near
at
hand
.
Kaethe
collapsed
with
:
``
Your
father
is
ill
in
Lausanne
--
Dick
wants
to
talk
to
Franz
about
it
.
''
``
Is
he
very
sick
?
''
Nicole
demanded
--
just
as
Franz
came
up
with
his
hearty
hospital
manner
.
Gratefully
Kaethe
passed
the
remnant
of
the
buck
to
him
--
but
the
damage
was
done
.
``
I
'm
going
to
Lausanne
,
''
announced
Nicole
.
``
One
minute
,
''
said
Franz
.
``
I
'm
not
sure
it
's
advisable
.
I
must
first
talk
on
the
phone
to
Dick
.
''
``
Then
I
'll
miss
the
train
down
,
''
Nicole
protested
,
``
and
then
I
'll
miss
the
three
o'clock
from
Zurich
!
If
my
father
is
dying
I
must
--
''
She
left
this
in
the
air
,
afraid
to
formulate
it
.
``
I
must
go
.
I
'll
have
to
run
for
the
train
.
''
She
was
running
even
as
she
spoke
toward
the
sequence
of
flat
cars
that
crowned
the
bare
hill
with
bursting
steam
and
sound
.
Over
her
shoulder
she
called
back
,
``
If
you
phone
Dick
tell
him
I
'm
coming
,
Franz
!
''
.
.
.
.
.
.
Dick
was
in
his
own
room
in
the
hotel
reading
The
New
York
Herald
when
the
swallow-like
nun
rushed
in
--
simultaneously
the
phone
rang
.
``
Is
he
dead
?
''
Dick
demanded
of
the
nun
,
hopefully
.
``
Monsieur
,
il
est
parti
--
he
has
gone
away
.
''
``
Comment
?
''
``
Il
est
parti
--
his
man
and
his
baggage
have
gone
away
too
!
''
It
was
incredible
.
A
man
in
that
condition
to
arise
and
depart
.
Dick
answered
the
phone-call
from
Franz
.
``
You
should
n't
have
told
Nicole
,
''
he
protested
.
``
Kaethe
told
her
,
very
unwisely
.
''
``
I
suppose
it
was
my
fault
.
Never
tell
a
thing
to
a
woman
till
it
's
done
.
However
,
I
'll
meet
Nicole
.
.
.
say
,
Franz
,
the
craziest
thing
has
happened
down
here
--
the
old
boy
took
up
his
bed
and
walked
.
.
.
.
''
``
At
what
?
What
did
you
say
?
''
``
I
say
he
walked
,
old
Warren
--
he
walked
!
''
``
But
why
not
?
''
``
He
was
supposed
to
be
dying
of
general
collapse
.
.
.
he
got
up
and
walked
away
,
back
to
Chicago
,
I
guess
.
.
.
.
I
do
n't
know
,
the
nurse
is
here
now
.
.
.
.
I
do
n't
know
,
Franz
--
I
've
just
heard
about
it
.
.
.
.
Call
me
later
.
''
He
spent
the
better
part
of
two
hours
tracing
Warren
's
movements
.
The
patient
had
found
an
opportunity
between
the
change
of
day
and
night
nurses
to
resort
to
the
bar
where
he
had
gulped
down
four
whiskeys
;
he
paid
his
hotel
bill
with
a
thousand
dollar
note
,
instructing
the
desk
that
the
change
should
be
sent
after
him
,
and
departed
,
presumably
for
America
.
A
last
minute
dash
by
Dick
and
Dangeu
to
overtake
him
at
the
station
resulted
only
in
Dick
's
failing
to
meet
Nicole
;
when
they
did
meet
in
the
lobby
of
the
hotel
she
seemed
suddenly
tired
,
and
there
was
a
tight
purse
to
her
lips
that
disquieted
him
.
``
How
's
father
?
''
she
demanded
.
``
He
's
much
better
.
He
seemed
to
have
a
good
deal
of
reserve
energy
after
all
.
''
He
hesitated
,
breaking
it
to
her
easy
.
``
In
fact
he
got
up
and
went
away
.
''
Wanting
a
drink
,
for
the
chase
had
occupied
the
dinner
hour
,
he
led
her
,
puzzled
,
toward
the
grill
,
and
continued
as
they
occupied
two
leather
easy-chairs
and
ordered
a
high-ball
and
a
glass
of
beer
:
``
The
man
who
was
taking
care
of
him
made
a
wrong
prognosis
or
something
--
wait
a
minute
,
I
've
hardly
had
time
to
think
the
thing
out
myself
.
''
``
He
's
gone
?
''
``
He
got
the
evening
train
for
Paris
.
''
They
sat
silent
.
From
Nicole
flowed
a
vast
tragic
apathy
.
``
It
was
instinct
,
''
Dick
said
,
finally
.
``
He
was
really
dying
,
but
he
tried
to
get
a
resumption
of
rhythm
--
he
's
not
the
first
person
that
ever
walked
off
his
death-bed
--
like
an
old
clock
--
you
know
,
you
shake
it
and
somehow
from
sheer
habit
it
gets
going
again
.
Now
your
father
--
''
``
Oh
,
do
n't
tell
me
,
''
she
said
.
``
His
principal
fuel
was
fear
,
''
he
continued
.
``
He
got
afraid
,
and
off
he
went
.
He
'll
probably
live
till
ninety
--
''
``
Please
do
n't
tell
me
any
more
,
''
she
said
.
``
Please
do
n't
--
I
could
n't
stand
any
more
.
''
``
All
right
.
The
little
devil
I
came
down
to
see
is
hopeless
.
We
may
as
well
go
back
to-morrow
.
''
``
I
do
n't
see
why
you
have
to
--
come
in
contact
with
all
this
,
''
she
burst
forth
.
``
Oh
,
do
n't
you
?
Sometimes
I
do
n't
either
.
''
She
put
her
hand
on
his
.
``
Oh
,
I
'm
sorry
I
said
that
,
Dick
.
''
Some
one
had
brought
a
phonograph
into
the
bar
and
they
sat
listening
to
The
Wedding
of
the
Painted
Doll
.
III
One
morning
a
week
later
,
stopping
at
the
desk
for
his
mail
,
Dick
became
aware
of
some
extra
commotion
outside
:
Patient
Von
Cohn
Morris
was
going
away
.
His
parents
,
Australians
,
were
putting
his
baggage
vehemently
into
a
large
limousine
,
and
beside
them
stood
Doctor
Ladislau
protesting
with
ineffectual
attitudes
against
the
violent
gesturings
of
Morris
,
senior
.
The
young
man
was
regarding
his
embarkation
with
aloof
cynicism
as
Doctor
Diver
approached
.
``
Is
n't
this
a
little
sudden
,
Mr
.
Morris
?
''
Mr.
Morris
started
as
he
saw
Dick
--
his
florid
face
and
the
large
checks
on
his
suit
seemed
to
turn
off
and
on
like
electric
lights
.
He
approached
Dick
as
though
to
strike
him
.
``
High
time
we
left
,
we
and
those
who
have
come
with
us
,
''
he
began
,
and
paused
for
breath
.
``
It
is
high
time
,
Doctor
Diver
.
High
time
.
''
``
Will
you
come
in
my
office
?
''
Dick
suggested
.
``
Not
I
!
I
'll
talk
to
you
,
but
I
'm
washing
my
hands
of
you
and
your
place
.
''
He
shook
his
finger
at
Dick
.
``
I
was
just
telling
this
doctor
here
.
We
've
wasted
our
time
and
our
money
.
''
Doctor
Ladislau
stirred
in
a
feeble
negative
,
signalling
up
a
vague
Slavic
evasiveness
.
Dick
had
never
liked
Ladislau
.
He
managed
to
walk
the
excited
Australian
along
the
path
in
the
direction
of
his
office
,
trying
to
persuade
him
to
enter
;
but
the
man
shook
his
head
.
``
It
's
you
,
Doctor
Diver
,
you
,
the
very
man
.
I
went
to
Doctor
Ladislau
because
you
were
not
to
be
found
,
Doctor
Diver
,
and
because
Doctor
Gregorovius
is
not
expected
until
the
nightfall
,
and
I
would
not
wait
.
No
,
sir
!
I
would
not
wait
a
minute
after
my
son
told
me
the
truth
.
''
He
came
up
menacingly
to
Dick
,
who
kept
his
hands
loose
enough
to
drop
him
if
it
seemed
necessary
.
``
My
son
is
here
for
alcoholism
,
and
he
told
us
he
smelt
liquor
on
your
breath
.
Yes
,
sir
!
''
He
made
a
quick
,
apparently
unsuccessful
sniff
.
``
Not
once
,
but
twice
Von
Cohn
says
he
has
smelt
liquor
on
your
breath
.
I
and
my
lady
have
never
touched
a
drop
of
it
in
our
lives
.
We
hand
Von
Cohn
to
you
to
be
cured
,
and
within
a
month
he
twice
smells
liquor
on
your
breath
!
What
kind
of
cure
is
that
there
?
''
Dick
hesitated
;
Mr.
Morris
was
quite
capable
of
making
a
scene
on
the
clinic
drive
.
``
After
all
,
Mr.
Morris
,
some
people
are
not
going
to
give
up
what
they
regard
as
food
because
of
your
son
--
''
``
But
you
're
a
doctor
,
man
!
''
cried
Morris
furiously
.
``
When
the
workmen
drink
their
beer
that
's
bad
'cess
to
them
--
but
you
're
here
supposing
to
cure
--
''
``
This
has
gone
too
far
.
Your
son
came
to
us
because
of
kleptomania
.
''
``
What
was
behind
it
?
''
The
man
was
almost
shrieking
.
``
Drink
--
black
drink
.
Do
you
know
what
color
black
is
?
It
's
black
!
My
own
uncle
was
hung
by
the
neck
because
of
it
,
you
hear
?
My
son
comes
to
a
sanitarium
,
and
a
doctor
reeks
of
it
!
''
``
I
must
ask
you
to
leave
.
''
``
You
ask
me
!
We
are
leaving
!
''
``
If
you
could
be
a
little
temperate
we
could
tell
you
the
results
of
the
treatment
to
date
.
Naturally
,
since
you
feel
as
you
do
,
we
would
not
want
your
son
as
a
patient
--
''
``
You
dare
to
use
the
word
temperate
to
me
?
''
Dick
called
to
Doctor
Ladislau
and
as
he
approached
,
said
:
``
Will
you
represent
us
in
saying
good-by
to
the
patient
and
to
his
family
?
''
He
bowed
slightly
to
Morris
and
went
into
his
office
,
and
stood
rigid
for
a
moment
just
inside
the
door
.
He
watched
until
they
drove
away
,
the
gross
parents
,
the
bland
,
degenerate
offspring
:
it
was
easy
to
prophesy
the
family
's
swing
around
Europe
,
bullying
their
betters
with
hard
ignorance
and
hard
money
.
But
what
absorbed
Dick
after
the
disappearance
of
the
caravan
was
the
question
as
to
what
extent
he
had
provoked
this
.
He
drank
claret
with
each
meal
,
took
a
nightcap
,
generally
in
the
form
of
hot
rum
,
and
sometimes
he
tippled
with
gin
in
the
afternoons
--
gin
was
the
most
difficult
to
detect
on
the
breath
.
He
was
averaging
a
half-pint
of
alcohol
a
day
,
too
much
for
his
system
to
burn
up
.
Dismissing
a
tendency
to
justify
himself
,
he
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
wrote
out
,
like
a
prescription
,
a
régime
that
would
cut
his
liquor
in
half
.
Doctors
,
chauffeurs
,
and
Protestant
clergymen
could
never
smell
of
liquor
,
as
could
painters
,
brokers
,
cavalry
leaders
;
Dick
blamed
himself
only
for
indiscretion
.
But
the
matter
was
by
no
means
clarified
half
an
hour
later
when
Franz
,
revivified
by
an
Alpine
fortnight
,
rolled
up
the
drive
,
so
eager
to
resume
work
that
he
was
plunged
in
it
before
he
reached
his
office
.
Dick
met
him
there
.
``
How
was
Mount
Everest
?
''
``
We
could
very
well
have
done
Mount
Everest
the
rate
we
were
doing
.
We
thought
of
it
.
How
goes
it
all
?
How
is
my
Kaethe
,
how
is
your
Nicole
?
''
``
All
goes
smooth
domestically
.
But
my
God
,
Franz
,
we
had
a
rotten
scene
this
morning
.
''
``
How
?
What
was
it
?
''
Dick
walked
around
the
room
while
Franz
got
in
touch
with
his
villa
by
telephone
.
After
the
family
exchange
was
over
,
Dick
said
:
``
The
Morris
boy
was
taken
away
--
there
was
a
row
.
''
Franz
's
buoyant
face
fell
.
``
I
knew
he
'd
left
.
I
met
Ladislau
on
the
veranda
.
''
``
What
did
Ladislau
say
?
''
``
Just
that
young
Morris
had
gone
--
that
you
'd
tell
me
about
it
.
What
about
it
?
''
``
The
usual
incoherent
reasons
.
''
``
He
was
a
devil
,
that
boy
.
''
``
He
was
a
case
for
anesthesia
,
''
Dick
agreed
.
``
Anyhow
,
the
father
had
beaten
Ladislau
into
a
colonial
subject
by
the
time
I
came
along
.
What
about
Ladislau
?
Do
we
keep
him
?
I
say
no
--
he
's
not
much
of
a
man
,
he
ca
n't
seem
to
cope
with
anything
.
''
Dick
hesitated
on
the
verge
of
the
truth
,
swung
away
to
give
himself
space
within
which
to
recapitulate
.
Franz
perched
on
the
edge
of
a
desk
,
still
in
his
linen
duster
and
travelling
gloves
.
Dick
said
:
``
One
of
the
remarks
the
boy
made
to
his
father
was
that
your
distinguished
collaborator
was
a
drunkard
.
The
man
is
a
fanatic
,
and
the
descendant
seems
to
have
caught
traces
of
vin-du-pays
on
me
.
''
Franz
sat
down
,
musing
on
his
lower
lip
.
``
You
can
tell
me
at
length
,
''
he
said
finally
.
``
Why
not
now
?
''
Dick
suggested
.
``
You
must
know
I
'm
the
last
man
to
abuse
liquor
.
''
His
eyes
and
Franz
's
glinted
on
each
other
,
pair
on
pair
.
``
Ladislau
let
the
man
get
so
worked
up
that
I
was
on
the
defensive
.
It
might
have
happened
in
front
of
patients
,
and
you
can
imagine
how
hard
it
could
be
to
defend
yourself
in
a
situation
like
that
!
''
Franz
took
off
his
gloves
and
coat
.
He
went
to
the
door
and
told
the
secretary
,
``
Do
n't
disturb
us
.
''
Coming
back
into
the
room
he
flung
himself
at
the
long
table
and
fooled
with
his
mail
,
reasoning
as
little
as
is
characteristic
of
people
in
such
postures
,
rather
summoning
up
a
suitable
mask
for
what
he
had
to
say
.
``
Dick
,
I
know
well
that
you
are
a
temperate
,
well-balanced
man
,
even
though
we
do
not
entirely
agree
on
the
subject
of
alcohol
.
But
a
time
has
come
--
Dick
,
I
must
say
frankly
that
I
have
been
aware
several
times
that
you
have
had
a
drink
when
it
was
not
the
moment
to
have
one
.
There
is
some
reason
.
Why
not
try
another
leave
of
abstinence
?
''
``
Absence
,
''
Dick
corrected
him
automatically
.
``
It
's
no
solution
for
me
to
go
away
.
''
They
were
both
chafed
,
Franz
at
having
his
return
marred
and
blurred
.
``
Sometimes
you
do
n't
use
your
common
sense
,
Dick
.
''
``
I
never
understood
what
common
sense
meant
applied
to
complicated
problems
--
unless
it
means
that
a
general
practitioner
can
perform
a
better
operation
than
a
specialist
.
''
He
was
seized
by
an
overwhelming
disgust
for
the
situation
.
To
explain
,
to
patch
--
these
were
not
natural
functions
at
their
age
--
better
to
continue
with
the
cracked
echo
of
an
old
truth
in
the
ears
.
``
This
is
no
go
,
''
he
said
suddenly
.
``
Well
,
that
's
occurred
to
me
,
''
Franz
admitted
.
``
Your
heart
is
n't
in
this
project
any
more
,
Dick
.
''
``
I
know
.
I
want
to
leave
--
we
could
strike
some
arrangement
about
taking
Nicole
's
money
out
gradually
.
''
``
I
have
thought
about
that
too
,
Dick
--
I
have
seen
this
coming
.
I
am
able
to
arrange
other
backing
,
and
it
will
be
possible
to
take
all
your
money
out
by
the
end
of
the
year
.
''
Dick
had
not
intended
to
come
to
a
decision
so
quickly
,
nor
was
he
prepared
for
Franz
's
so
ready
acquiescence
in
the
break
,
yet
he
was
relieved
.
Not
without
desperation
he
had
long
felt
the
ethics
of
his
profession
dissolving
into
a
lifeless
mass
.
IV
The
Divers
would
return
to
the
Riviera
,
which
was
home
.
The
Villa
Diana
had
been
rented
again
for
the
summer
,
so
they
divided
the
intervening
time
between
German
spas
and
French
cathedral
towns
where
they
were
always
happy
for
a
few
days
.
Dick
wrote
a
little
with
no
particular
method
;
it
was
one
of
those
parts
of
life
that
is
an
awaiting
;
not
upon
Nicole
's
health
,
which
seemed
to
thrive
on
travel
,
nor
upon
work
,
but
simply
an
awaiting
.
The
factor
that
gave
purposefulness
to
the
period
was
the
children
.
Dick
's
interest
in
them
increased
with
their
ages
,
now
eleven
and
nine
.
He
managed
to
reach
them
over
the
heads
of
employees
on
the
principle
that
both
the
forcing
of
children
and
the
fear
of
forcing
them
were
inadequate
substitutes
for
the
long
,
careful
watchfulness
,
the
checking
and
balancing
and
reckoning
of
accounts
,
to
the
end
that
there
should
be
no
slip
below
a
certain
level
of
duty
.
He
came
to
know
them
much
better
than
Nicole
did
,
and
in
expansive
moods
over
the
wines
of
several
countries
he
talked
and
played
with
them
at
length
.
They
had
that
wistful
charm
,
almost
sadness
,
peculiar
to
children
who
have
learned
early
not
to
cry
or
laugh
with
abandon
;
they
were
apparently
moved
to
no
extremes
of
emotion
,
but
content
with
a
simple
regimentation
and
the
simple
pleasures
allowed
them
.
They
lived
on
the
even
tenor
found
advisable
in
the
experience
of
old
families
of
the
Western
world
,
brought
up
rather
than
brought
out
.
Dick
thought
,
for
example
,
that
nothing
was
more
conducive
to
the
development
of
observation
than
compulsory
silence
.
Lanier
was
an
unpredictable
boy
with
an
inhuman
curiosity
.
``
Well
,
how
many
Pomeranians
would
it
take
to
lick
a
lion
,
father
?
''
was
typical
of
the
questions
with
which
he
harassed
Dick
.
Topsy
was
easier
.
She
was
nine
and
very
fair
and
exquisitely
made
like
Nicole
,
and
in
the
past
Dick
had
worried
about
that
.
Lately
she
had
become
as
robust
as
any
American
child
.
He
was
satisfied
with
them
both
,
but
conveyed
the
fact
to
them
only
in
a
tacit
way
.
They
were
not
let
off
breaches
of
good
conduct
--
''
Either
one
learns
politeness
at
home
,
''
Dick
said
,
``
or
the
world
teaches
it
to
you
with
a
whip
and
you
may
get
hurt
in
the
process
.
What
do
I
care
whether
Topsy
'adores
'
me
or
not
?
I
'm
not
bringing
her
up
to
be
my
wife
.
''
Another
element
that
distinguished
this
summer
and
autumn
for
the
Divers
was
a
plenitude
of
money
.
Due
to
the
sale
of
their
interest
in
the
clinic
,
and
to
developments
in
America
,
there
was
now
so
much
that
the
mere
spending
of
it
,
the
care
of
goods
,
was
an
absorption
in
itself
.
The
style
in
which
they
travelled
seemed
fabulous
.
Regard
them
,
for
example
,
as
the
train
slows
up
at
Boyen
where
they
are
to
spend
a
fortnight
visiting
.
The
shifting
from
the
wagon-lit
has
begun
at
the
Italian
frontier
.
The
governess
's
maid
and
Madame
Diver
's
maid
have
come
up
from
second
class
to
help
with
the
baggage
and
the
dogs
.
Mlle
.
Bellois
will
superintend
the
hand-luggage
,
leaving
the
Sealyhams
to
one
maid
and
the
pair
of
Pekinese
to
the
other
.
It
is
not
necessarily
poverty
of
spirit
that
makes
a
woman
surround
herself
with
life
--
it
can
be
a
superabundance
of
interest
,
and
,
except
during
her
flashes
of
illness
,
Nicole
was
capable
of
being
curator
of
it
all
.
For
example
with
the
great
quantity
of
heavy
baggage
--
presently
from
the
van
would
be
unloaded
four
wardrobe
trunks
,
a
shoe
trunk
,
three
hat
trunks
,
and
two
hat
boxes
,
a
chest
of
servants
'
trunks
,
a
portable
filing-cabinet
,
a
medicine
case
,
a
spirit
lamp
container
,
a
picnic
set
,
four
tennis
rackets
in
presses
and
cases
,
a
phonograph
,
a
typewriter
.
Distributed
among
the
spaces
reserved
for
family
and
entourage
were
two
dozen
supplementary
grips
,
satchels
and
packages
,
each
one
numbered
,
down
to
the
tag
on
the
cane
case
.
Thus
all
of
it
could
be
checked
up
in
two
minutes
on
any
station
platform
,
some
for
storage
,
some
for
accompaniment
from
the
``
light
trip
list
''
or
the
``
heavy
trip
list
,
''
constantly
revised
,
and
carried
on
metal-edged
plaques
in
Nicole
's
purse
.
She
had
devised
the
system
as
a
child
when
travelling
with
her
failing
mother
.
It
was
equivalent
to
the
system
of
a
regimental
supply
officer
who
must
think
of
the
bellies
and
equipment
of
three
thousand
men
.
The
Divers
flocked
from
the
train
into
the
early
gathered
twilight
of
the
valley
.
The
village
people
watched
the
debarkation
with
an
awe
akin
to
that
which
followed
the
Italian
pilgrimages
of
Lord
Byron
a
century
before
.
Their
hostess
was
the
Contessa
di
Minghetti
,
lately
Mary
North
.
The
journey
that
had
begun
in
a
room
over
the
shop
of
a
paperhanger
in
Newark
had
ended
in
an
extraordinary
marriage
.
``
Conte
di
Minghetti
''
was
merely
a
papal
title
--
the
wealth
of
Mary
's
husband
flowed
from
his
being
ruler-owner
of
manganese
deposits
in
southwestern
Asia
.
He
was
not
quite
light
enough
to
travel
in
a
pullman
south
of
Mason-Dixon
;
he
was
of
the
Kyble-Berber-Sabaean-Hindu
strain
that
belts
across
north
Africa
and
Asia
,
more
sympathetic
to
the
European
than
the
mongrel
faces
of
the
ports
.
When
these
princely
households
,
one
of
the
East
,
one
of
the
West
,
faced
each
other
on
the
station
platform
,
the
splendor
of
the
Divers
seemed
pioneer
simplicity
by
comparison
.
Their
hosts
were
accompanied
by
an
Italian
major-domo
carrying
a
staff
,
by
a
quartet
of
turbaned
retainers
on
motorcycles
,
and
by
two
half-veiled
females
who
stood
respectfully
a
little
behind
Mary
and
salaamed
at
Nicole
,
making
her
jump
with
the
gesture
.
To
Mary
as
well
as
to
the
Divers
the
greeting
was
faintly
comic
;
Mary
gave
an
apologetic
,
belittling
giggle
;
yet
her
voice
,
as
she
introduced
her
husband
by
his
Asiatic
title
,
flew
proud
and
high
.
In
their
rooms
as
they
dressed
for
dinner
,
Dick
and
Nicole
grimaced
at
each
other
in
an
awed
way
:
such
rich
as
want
to
be
thought
democratic
pretend
in
private
to
be
swept
off
their
feet
by
swank
.
``
Little
Mary
North
knows
what
she
wants
,
''
Dick
muttered
through
his
shaving
cream
.
``
Abe
educated
her
,
and
now
she
's
married
to
a
Buddha
.
If
Europe
ever
goes
Bolshevik
she
'll
turn
up
as
the
bride
of
Stalin
.
''
Nicole
looked
around
from
her
dressing-case
.
``
Watch
your
tongue
,
Dick
,
will
you
?
''
But
she
laughed
.
``
They
're
very
swell
.
The
warships
all
fire
at
them
or
salute
them
or
something
.
Mary
rides
in
the
royal
bus
in
London
.
''
``
All
right
,
''
he
agreed
.
As
he
heard
Nicole
at
the
door
asking
for
pins
,
he
called
,
``
I
wonder
if
I
could
have
some
whiskey
;
I
feel
the
mountain
air
!
''
``
She
'll
see
to
it
,
''
presently
Nicole
called
through
the
bathroom
door
.
``
It
was
one
of
those
women
who
were
at
the
station
.
She
has
her
veil
off
.
''
``
What
did
Mary
tell
you
about
life
?
''
he
asked
.
``
She
did
n't
say
so
much
--
she
was
interested
in
high
life
--
she
asked
me
a
lot
of
questions
about
my
genealogy
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
as
if
I
knew
anything
about
it
.
But
it
seems
the
bridegroom
has
two
very
tan
children
by
another
marriage
--
one
of
them
ill
with
some
Asiatic
thing
they
ca
n't
diagnose
.
I
've
got
to
warn
the
children
.
Sounds
very
peculiar
to
me
.
Mary
will
see
how
we
'd
feel
about
it
.
''
She
stood
worrying
a
minute
.
``
She
'll
understand
,
''
Dick
reassured
her
.
``
Probably
the
child
's
in
bed
.
''
At
dinner
Dick
talked
to
Hosain
,
who
had
been
at
an
English
public
school
.
Hosain
wanted
to
know
about
stocks
and
about
Hollywood
and
Dick
,
whipping
up
his
imagination
with
champagne
,
told
him
preposterous
tales
.
``
Billions
?
''
Hosain
demanded
.
``
Trillions
,
''
Dick
assured
him
.
``
I
did
n't
truly
realize
--
''
``
Well
,
perhaps
millions
,
''
Dick
conceded
.
``
Every
hotel
guest
is
assigned
a
harem
--
or
what
amounts
to
a
harem
.
''
``
Other
than
the
actors
and
directors
?
''
``
Every
hotel
guest
--
even
travelling
salesmen
.
Why
,
they
tried
to
send
me
up
a
dozen
candidates
,
but
Nicole
would
n't
stand
for
it
.
''
Nicole
reproved
him
when
they
were
in
their
room
alone
.
``
Why
so
many
highballs
?
Why
did
you
use
your
word
spic
in
front
of
him
?
''
``
Excuse
me
,
I
meant
smoke
.
The
tongue
slipped
.
''
``
Dick
,
this
is
n't
faintly
like
you
.
''
``
Excuse
me
again
.
I
'm
not
much
like
myself
any
more
.
''
That
night
Dick
opened
a
bathroom
window
,
giving
on
a
narrow
and
tubular
court
of
the
château
,
gray
as
rats
but
echoing
at
the
moment
to
plaintive
and
peculiar
music
,
sad
as
a
flute
.
Two
men
were
chanting
in
an
Eastern
language
or
dialect
full
of
k
's
and
l
's
--
he
leaned
out
but
he
could
not
see
them
;
there
was
obviously
a
religious
significance
in
the
sounds
,
and
tired
and
emotionless
he
let
them
pray
for
him
too
,
but
what
for
,
save
that
he
should
not
lose
himself
in
his
increasing
melancholy
,
he
did
not
know
.
Next
day
,
over
a
thinly
wooded
hillside
they
shot
scrawny
birds
,
distant
poor
relations
to
the
partridge
.
It
was
done
in
a
vague
imitation
of
the
English
manner
,
with
a
corps
of
inexperienced
beaters
whom
Dick
managed
to
miss
by
firing
only
directly
overhead
.
On
their
return
Lanier
was
waiting
in
their
suite
.
``
Father
,
you
said
tell
you
immediately
if
we
were
near
the
sick
boy
.
''
Nicole
whirled
about
,
immediately
on
guard.
``
--
so
,
Mother
,
''
Lanier
continued
,
turning
to
her
,
``
the
boy
takes
a
bath
every
evening
and
to-night
he
took
his
bath
just
before
mine
and
I
had
to
take
mine
in
his
water
,
and
it
was
dirty
.
''
``
What
?
Now
what
?
''
``
I
saw
them
take
Tony
out
of
it
,
and
then
they
called
me
into
it
and
the
water
was
dirty
.
''
``
But
--
did
you
take
it
?
''
``
Yes
,
Mother
.
''
``
Heavens
!
''
she
exclaimed
to
Dick
.
He
demanded
:
``
Why
did
n't
Lucienne
draw
your
bath
?
''
``
Lucienne
ca
n't
.
It
's
a
funny
heater
--
it
reached
out
of
itself
and
burned
her
arm
last
night
and
she
's
afraid
of
it
,
so
one
of
those
two
women
--
''
``
You
go
in
this
bathroom
and
take
a
bath
now
.
''
``
Do
n't
say
I
told
you
,
''
said
Lanier
from
the
doorway
.
Dick
went
in
and
sprinkled
the
tub
with
sulphur
;
closing
the
door
he
said
to
Nicole
:
``
Either
we
speak
to
Mary
or
we
'd
better
get
out
.
''
She
agreed
and
he
continued
:
``
People
think
their
children
are
constitutionally
cleaner
than
other
people
's
,
and
their
diseases
are
less
contagious
.
''
Dick
came
in
and
helped
himself
from
the
decanter
,
chewing
a
biscuit
savagely
in
the
rhythm
of
the
pouring
water
in
the
bathroom
.
``
Tell
Lucienne
that
she
's
got
to
learn
about
the
heater
--
''
he
suggested
.
At
that
moment
the
Asiatic
woman
came
in
person
to
the
door
.
``
El
Contessa
--
''
Dick
beckoned
her
inside
and
closed
the
door
.
``
Is
the
little
sick
boy
better
?
''
he
inquired
pleasantly
.
``
Better
,
yes
,
but
he
still
has
the
eruptions
frequently
.
''
``
That
's
too
bad
--
I
'm
very
sorry
.
But
you
see
our
children
must
n't
be
bathed
in
his
water
.
That
's
out
of
the
question
--
I
'm
sure
your
mistress
would
be
furious
if
she
had
known
you
had
done
a
thing
like
that
.
''
``
I
?
''
She
seemed
thunderstruck
.
``
Why
,
I
merely
saw
your
maid
had
difficulty
with
the
heater
--
I
told
her
about
it
and
started
the
water
.
''
``
But
with
a
sick
person
you
must
empty
the
bathwater
entirely
out
,
and
clean
the
tub
.
''
``
I
?
''
Chokingly
the
woman
drew
a
long
breath
,
uttered
a
convulsed
sob
and
rushed
from
the
room
.
``
She
must
n't
get
up
on
western
civilization
at
our
expense
,
''
he
said
grimly
.
At
dinner
that
night
he
decided
that
it
must
inevitably
be
a
truncated
visit
:
about
his
own
country
Hosain
seemed
to
have
observed
only
that
there
were
many
mountains
and
some
goats
and
herders
of
goats
.
He
was
a
reserved
young
man
--
to
draw
him
out
would
have
required
the
sincere
effort
that
Dick
now
reserved
for
his
family
.
Soon
after
dinner
Hosain
left
Mary
and
the
Divers
to
themselves
,
but
the
old
unity
was
split
--
between
them
lay
the
restless
social
fields
that
Mary
was
about
to
conquer
.
Dick
was
relieved
when
,
at
nine-thirty
,
Mary
received
and
read
a
note
and
got
up
.
``
You
'll
have
to
excuse
me
.
My
husband
is
leaving
on
a
short
trip
--
and
I
must
be
with
him
.
''
Next
morning
,
hard
on
the
heels
of
the
servant
bringing
coffee
,
Mary
entered
their
room
.
She
was
dressed
and
they
were
not
dressed
,
and
she
had
the
air
of
having
been
up
for
some
time
.
Her
face
was
toughened
with
quiet
jerky
fury
.
``
What
is
this
story
about
Lanier
having
been
bathed
in
a
dirty
bath
?
''
Dick
began
to
protest
,
but
she
cut
through
:
``
What
is
this
story
that
you
commanded
my
husband
's
sister
to
clean
Lanier
's
tub
?
''
She
remained
on
her
feet
staring
at
them
,
as
they
sat
impotent
as
idols
in
their
beds
,
weighted
by
their
trays
.
Together
they
exclaimed
:
``
His
sister
!
''
``
That
you
ordered
one
of
his
sisters
to
clean
out
a
tub
!
''
``
We
did
n't
--
''
their
voices
rang
together
saying
the
same
thing
,
``
--
I
spoke
to
the
native
servant
--
''
``
You
spoke
to
Hosain
's
sister
.
''
Dick
could
only
say
:
``
I
supposed
they
were
two
maids
.
''
``
You
were
told
they
were
Himadoun
.
''
``
What
?
''
Dick
got
out
of
bed
and
into
a
robe
.
``
I
explained
it
to
you
at
the
piano
night
before
last
.
Do
n't
tell
me
you
were
too
merry
to
understand
.
''
``
Was
that
what
you
said
?
I
did
n't
hear
the
beginning
.
I
did
n't
connect
the
--
we
did
n't
make
any
connection
,
Mary
.
Well
,
all
we
can
do
is
see
her
and
apologize
.
''
``
See
her
and
apologize
!
I
explained
to
you
that
when
the
oldest
member
of
the
family
--
when
the
oldest
one
marries
,
well
,
the
two
oldest
sisters
consecrate
themselves
to
being
Himadoun
,
to
being
his
wife
's
ladies-in-waiting
.
''
``
Was
that
why
Hosain
left
the
house
last
night
?
''
Mary
hesitated
;
then
nodded
.
``
He
had
to
--
they
all
left
.
His
honor
makes
it
necessary
.
''
Now
both
the
Divers
were
up
and
dressing
;
Mary
went
on
:
``
And
what
's
all
that
about
the
bathwater
.
As
if
a
thing
like
that
could
happen
in
this
house
!
We
'll
ask
Lanier
about
it
.
''
Dick
sat
on
the
bedside
indicating
in
a
private
gesture
to
Nicole
that
she
should
take
over
.
Meanwhile
Mary
went
to
the
door
and
spoke
to
an
attendant
in
Italian
.
``
Wait
a
minute
,
''
Nicole
said
.
``
I
wo
n't
have
that
.
''
``
You
accused
us
,
''
answered
Mary
,
in
a
tone
she
had
never
used
to
Nicole
before
.
``
Now
I
have
a
right
to
see
.
''
``
I
wo
n't
have
the
child
brought
in
.
''
Nicole
threw
on
her
clothes
as
though
they
were
chain
mail
.
``
That
's
all
right
,
''
said
Dick
.
``
Bring
Lanier
in
.
We
'll
settle
this
bathtub
matter
--
fact
or
myth
.
''
Lanier
,
half
clothed
mentally
and
physically
,
gazed
at
the
angered
faces
of
the
adults
.
``
Listen
,
Lanier
,
''
Mary
demanded
,
``
how
did
you
come
to
think
you
were
bathed
in
water
that
had
been
used
before
?
''
``
Speak
up
,
''
Dick
added
.
``
It
was
just
dirty
,
that
was
all
.
''
``
Could
n't
you
hear
the
new
water
running
,
from
your
room
,
next
door
?
''
Lanier
admitted
the
possibility
but
reiterated
his
point
--
the
water
was
dirty
.
He
was
a
little
awed
;
he
tried
to
see
ahead
:
``
It
could
n't
have
been
running
,
because
--
''
They
pinned
him
down
.
``
Why
not
?
''
He
stood
in
his
little
kimono
arousing
the
sympathy
of
his
parents
and
further
arousing
Mary
's
impatience
--
then
he
said
:
``
The
water
was
dirty
,
it
was
full
of
soap-suds
.
''
``
When
you
're
not
sure
what
you
're
saying
--
''
Mary
began
,
but
Nicole
interrupted
.
``
Stop
it
,
Mary
.
If
there
were
dirty
suds
in
the
water
it
was
logical
to
think
it
was
dirty
.
His
father
told
him
to
come
--
''
``
There
could
n't
have
been
dirty
suds
in
the
water
.
''
Lanier
looked
reproachfully
at
his
father
,
who
had
betrayed
him
.
Nicole
turned
him
about
by
the
shoulders
and
sent
him
out
of
the
room
;
Dick
broke
the
tensity
with
a
laugh
.
Then
,
as
if
the
sound
recalled
the
past
,
the
old
friendship
,
Mary
guessed
how
far
away
from
them
she
had
gone
and
said
in
a
mollifying
tone
:
``
It
's
always
like
that
with
children
.
''
Her
uneasiness
grew
as
she
remembered
the
past
.
``
You
'd
be
silly
to
go
--
Hosain
wanted
to
make
this
trip
anyhow
.
After
all
,
you
're
my
guests
and
you
just
blundered
into
the
thing
.
''
But
Dick
,
made
more
angry
by
this
obliqueness
and
the
use
of
the
word
blunder
,
turned
away
and
began
arranging
his
effects
,
saying
:
``
It
's
too
bad
about
the
young
women
.
I
'd
like
to
apologize
to
the
one
who
came
in
here
.
''
``
If
you
'd
only
listened
on
the
piano
seat
!
''
``
But
you
've
gotten
so
damned
dull
,
Mary
.
I
listened
as
long
as
I
could
.
''
``
Be
quiet
!
''
Nicole
advised
him
.
``
I
return
his
compliment
,
''
said
Mary
bitterly
.
``
Good-by
,
Nicole
.
''
She
went
out
.
After
all
that
there
was
no
question
of
her
coming
to
see
them
off
;
the
major-domo
arranged
the
departure
.
Dick
left
formal
notes
for
Hosain
and
the
sisters
.
There
was
nothing
to
do
except
to
go
,
but
all
of
them
,
especially
Lanier
,
felt
bad
about
it
.
``
I
insist
,
''
insisted
Lanier
on
the
train
,
``
that
it
was
dirty
bathwater
.
''
``
That
'll
do
,
''
his
father
said
.
``
You
better
forget
it
--
unless
you
want
me
to
divorce
you
.
Did
you
know
there
was
a
new
law
in
France
that
you
can
divorce
a
child
?
''
Lanier
roared
with
delight
and
the
Divers
were
unified
again
--
Dick
wondered
how
many
more
times
it
could
be
done
.
V
Nicole
went
to
the
window
and
bent
over
the
sill
to
take
a
look
at
the
rising
altercation
on
the
terrace
;
the
April
sun
shone
pink
on
the
saintly
face
of
Augustine
,
the
cook
,
and
blue
on
the
butcher
's
knife
she
waved
in
her
drunken
hand
.
She
had
been
with
them
since
their
return
to
Villa
Diana
in
February
.
Because
of
an
obstruction
of
an
awning
she
could
see
only
Dick
's
head
and
his
hand
holding
one
of
his
heavy
canes
with
a
bronze
knob
on
it
.
The
knife
and
the
cane
,
menacing
each
other
,
were
like
tripos
and
short
sword
in
a
gladiatorial
combat
.
Dick
's
words
reached
her
first
:
``
--
care
how
much
kitchen
wine
you
drink
but
when
I
find
you
digging
into
a
bottle
of
Chablis
Moutonne
--
''
``
You
talk
about
drinking
!
''
Augustine
cried
,
flourishing
her
sabre
.
``
You
drink
--
all
the
time
!
''
Nicole
called
over
the
awning
:
``
What
's
the
matter
,
Dick
?
''
and
he
answered
in
English
:
``
The
old
girl
has
been
polishing
off
the
vintage
wines
.
I
'm
firing
her
--
at
least
I
'm
trying
to
.
''
``
Heavens
!
Well
,
do
n't
let
her
reach
you
with
that
knife
.
''
Augustine
shook
her
knife
up
at
Nicole
.
Her
old
mouth
was
made
of
two
small
intersecting
cherries
.
``
I
would
like
to
say
,
Madame
,
if
you
knew
that
your
husband
drinks
over
at
his
Bastide
comparatively
as
a
day-laborer
--
''
``
Shut
up
and
get
out
!
''
interrupted
Nicole
.
``
We
'll
get
the
gendarmes
.
''
``
You
'll
get
the
gendarmes
!
With
my
brother
in
the
corps
!
You
--
a
disgusting
American
?
''
In
English
Dick
called
up
to
Nicole
:
``
Get
the
children
away
from
the
house
till
I
settle
this
.
''
``
--
disgusting
Americans
who
come
here
and
drink
up
our
finest
wines
,
''
screamed
Augustine
with
the
voice
of
the
commune
.
Dick
mastered
a
firmer
tone
.
``
You
must
leave
now
!
I
'll
pay
you
what
we
owe
you
.
''
``
Very
sure
you
'll
pay
me
!
And
let
me
tell
you
--
''
she
came
close
and
waved
the
knife
so
furiously
that
Dick
raised
his
stick
,
whereupon
she
rushed
into
the
kitchen
and
returned
with
the
carving
knife
reinforced
by
a
hatchet
.
The
situation
was
not
prepossessing
--
Augustine
was
a
strong
woman
and
could
be
disarmed
only
at
the
risk
of
serious
results
to
herself
--
and
severe
legal
complications
which
were
the
lot
of
one
who
molested
a
French
citizen
.
Trying
a
bluff
Dick
called
up
to
Nicole
:
``
Phone
the
poste
de
police
.
''
Then
to
Augustine
,
indicating
her
armament
,
``
This
means
arrest
for
you
.
''
``
Ha-ha
!
''
she
laughed
demoniacally
;
nevertheless
she
came
no
nearer
.
Nicole
phoned
the
police
but
was
answered
with
what
was
almost
an
echo
of
Augustine
's
laugh
.
She
heard
mumbles
and
passings
of
the
word
around
--
the
connection
was
suddenly
broken
.
Returning
to
the
window
she
called
down
to
Dick
:
``
Give
her
something
extra
!
''
``
If
I
could
get
to
that
phone
!
''
As
this
seemed
impracticable
,
Dick
capitulated
.
For
fifty
francs
,
increased
to
a
hundred
as
he
succumbed
to
the
idea
of
getting
her
out
hastily
,
Augustine
yielded
her
fortress
,
covering
the
retreat
with
stormy
grenades
of
``
Salaud
!
''
She
would
leave
only
when
her
nephew
could
come
for
her
baggage
.
Waiting
cautiously
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
kitchen
Dick
heard
a
cork
pop
,
but
he
yielded
the
point
.
There
was
no
further
trouble
--
when
the
nephew
arrived
,
all
apologetic
,
Augustine
bade
Dick
a
cheerful
,
convivial
good-by
and
called
up
``
All
revoir
,
Madame
!
Bonne
chance
!
''
to
Nicole
's
window
.
The
Divers
went
to
Nice
and
dined
on
a
bouillabaisse
,
which
is
a
stew
of
rock
fish
and
small
lobsters
,
highly
seasoned
with
saffron
,
and
a
bottle
of
cold
Chablis
.
He
expressed
pity
for
Augustine
.
``
I
'm
not
sorry
a
bit
,
''
said
Nicole
.
``
I
'm
sorry
--
and
yet
I
wish
I
'd
shoved
her
over
the
cliff
.
''
There
was
little
they
dared
talk
about
in
these
days
;
seldom
did
they
find
the
right
word
when
it
counted
,
it
arrived
always
a
moment
too
late
when
one
could
not
reach
the
other
any
more
.
To-night
Augustine
's
outburst
had
shaken
them
from
their
separate
reveries
;
with
the
burn
and
chill
of
the
spiced
broth
and
the
parching
wine
they
talked
.
``
We
ca
n't
go
on
like
this
,
''
Nicole
suggested
.
``
Or
can
we
?
--
what
do
you
think
?
''
Startled
that
for
the
moment
Dick
did
not
deny
it
,
she
continued
,
``
Some
of
the
time
I
think
it
's
my
fault
--
I
've
ruined
you
.
''
``
So
I
'm
ruined
,
am
I
?
''
he
inquired
pleasantly
.
``
I
did
n't
mean
that
.
But
you
used
to
want
to
create
things
--
now
you
seem
to
want
to
smash
them
up
.
''
She
trembled
at
criticizing
him
in
these
broad
terms
--
but
his
enlarging
silence
frightened
her
even
more
.
She
guessed
that
something
was
developing
behind
the
silence
,
behind
the
hard
,
blue
eyes
,
the
almost
unnatural
interest
in
the
children
.
Uncharacteristic
bursts
of
temper
surprised
her
--
he
would
suddenly
unroll
a
long
scroll
of
contempt
for
some
person
,
race
,
class
,
way
of
life
,
way
of
thinking
.
It
was
as
though
an
incalculable
story
was
telling
itself
inside
him
,
about
which
she
could
only
guess
at
in
the
moments
when
it
broke
through
the
surface
.
``
After
all
,
what
do
you
get
out
of
this
?
''
she
demanded
.
``
Knowing
you
're
stronger
every
day
.
Knowing
that
your
illness
follows
the
law
of
diminishing
returns
.
''
His
voice
came
to
her
from
far
off
,
as
though
he
were
speaking
of
something
remote
and
academic
;
her
alarm
made
her
exclaim
,
``
Dick
!
''
and
she
thrust
her
hand
forward
to
his
across
the
table
.
A
reflex
pulled
Dick
's
hand
back
and
he
added
:
``
There
's
the
whole
situation
to
think
of
,
is
n't
there
?
There
's
not
just
you
.
''
He
covered
her
hand
with
his
and
said
in
the
old
pleasant
voice
of
a
conspirator
for
pleasure
,
mischief
,
profit
,
and
delight
:
``
See
that
boat
out
there
?
''
It
was
the
motor
yacht
of
T.
F.
Golding
lying
placid
among
the
little
swells
of
the
Nicean
Bay
,
constantly
bound
upon
a
romantic
voyage
that
was
not
dependent
upon
actual
motion
.
``
We
'll
go
out
there
now
and
ask
the
people
on
board
what
's
the
matter
with
them
.
We
'll
find
out
if
they
're
happy
.
''
``
We
hardly
know
him
,
''
Nicole
objected
.
``
He
urged
us
.
Besides
,
Baby
knows
him
--
she
practically
married
him
,
does
n't
she
--
did
n't
she
?
''
When
they
put
out
from
the
port
in
a
hired
launch
it
was
already
summer
dusk
and
lights
were
breaking
out
in
spasms
along
the
rigging
of
the
Margin
.
As
they
drew
up
alongside
,
Nicole
's
doubts
reasserted
themselves
.
``
He
's
having
a
party
--
''
``
It
's
only
a
radio
,
''
he
guessed
.
They
were
hailed
--
a
huge
white-haired
man
in
a
white
suit
looked
down
at
them
,
calling
:
``
Do
I
recognize
the
Divers
?
''
``
Boat
ahoy
,
Margin
!
''
Their
boat
moved
under
the
companionway
;
as
they
mounted
Golding
doubled
his
huge
frame
to
give
Nicole
a
hand
.
``
Just
in
time
for
dinner
.
''
A
small
orchestra
was
playing
astern
.
``
I
'm
yours
for
the
asking
--
but
till
then
you
ca
n't
ask
me
to
behave
--
''
And
as
Golding
's
cyclonic
arms
blew
them
aft
without
touching
them
,
Nicole
was
sorrier
they
had
come
,
and
more
impatient
at
Dick
.
Having
taken
up
an
attitude
of
aloofness
from
the
gay
people
here
,
at
the
time
when
Dick
's
work
and
her
health
were
incompatible
with
going
about
,
they
had
a
reputation
as
refusers
.
Riviera
replacements
during
the
ensuing
years
interpreted
this
as
a
vague
unpopularity
.
Nevertheless
,
having
taken
such
a
stand
,
Nicole
felt
it
should
not
be
cheaply
compromised
for
a
momentary
self-indulgence
.
As
they
passed
through
the
principal
salon
they
saw
ahead
of
them
figures
that
seemed
to
dance
in
the
half
light
of
the
circular
stern
.
This
was
an
illusion
made
by
the
enchantment
of
the
music
,
the
unfamiliar
lighting
,
and
the
surrounding
presence
of
water
.
Actually
,
save
for
some
busy
stewards
,
the
guests
loafed
on
a
wide
divan
that
followed
the
curve
of
the
deck
.
There
were
a
white
,
a
red
,
a
blurred
dress
,
the
laundered
chests
of
several
men
,
of
whom
one
,
detaching
and
identifying
himself
,
brought
from
Nicole
a
rare
little
cry
of
delight
.
``
Tommy
!
''
Brushing
aside
the
Gallicism
of
his
formal
dip
at
her
hand
,
Nicole
pressed
her
face
against
his
.
They
sat
,
or
rather
lay
down
together
on
the
Antoninian
bench
.
His
handsome
face
was
so
dark
as
to
have
lost
the
pleasantness
of
deep
tan
,
without
attaining
the
blue
beauty
of
Negroes
--
it
was
just
worn
leather
.
The
foreignness
of
his
depigmentation
by
unknown
suns
,
his
nourishment
by
strange
soils
,
his
tongue
awkward
with
the
curl
of
many
dialects
,
his
reactions
attuned
to
odd
alarms
--
these
things
fascinated
and
rested
Nicole
--
in
the
moment
of
meeting
she
lay
on
his
bosom
,
spiritually
,
going
out
and
out
.
.
.
.
Then
self-preservation
reasserted
itself
and
retiring
to
her
own
world
she
spoke
lightly
.
``
You
look
just
like
all
the
adventurers
in
the
movies
--
but
why
do
you
have
to
stay
away
so
long
?
''
Tommy
Barban
looked
at
her
,
uncomprehending
but
alert
;
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
flashed
.
``
Five
years
,
''
she
continued
,
in
throaty
mimicry
of
nothing
.
``
Much
too
long
.
Could
n't
you
only
slaughter
a
certain
number
of
creatures
and
then
come
back
,
and
breathe
our
air
for
a
while
?
''
In
her
cherished
presence
Tommy
Europeanized
himself
quickly
.
``
Mais
pour
nous
héros
,
''
he
said
,
``
il
nous
faut
du
temps
,
Nicole
.
Nous
ne
pouvons
pas
faire
de
petits
exercises
d'héroisme
--
il
faut
faire
les
grandes
compositions
.
''
``
Talk
English
to
me
,
Tommy
.
''
``
Parlez
français
avec
moi
,
Nicole
.
''
``
But
the
meanings
are
different
--
in
French
you
can
be
heroic
and
gallant
with
dignity
,
and
you
know
it
.
But
in
English
you
ca
n't
be
heroic
and
gallant
without
being
a
little
absurd
,
and
you
know
that
too
.
That
gives
me
an
advantage
.
''
``
But
after
all
--
''
He
chuckled
suddenly
.
``
Even
in
English
I
'm
brave
,
heroic
and
all
that
.
''
She
pretended
to
be
groggy
with
wonderment
but
he
was
not
abashed
.
``
I
only
know
what
I
see
in
the
cinema
,
''
he
said
.
``
Is
it
all
like
the
movies
?
''
``
The
movies
are
n't
so
bad
--
now
this
Ronald
Colman
--
have
you
seen
his
pictures
about
the
Corps
d'Afrique
du
Nord
?
They
're
not
bad
at
all
.
''
``
Very
well
,
whenever
I
go
to
the
movies
I
'll
know
you
're
going
through
just
that
sort
of
thing
at
that
moment
.
''
As
she
spoke
,
Nicole
was
aware
of
a
small
,
pale
,
pretty
young
woman
with
lovely
metallic
hair
,
almost
green
in
the
deck
lights
,
who
had
been
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
Tommy
and
might
have
been
part
either
of
their
conversation
or
of
the
one
next
to
them
.
She
had
obviously
had
a
monopoly
of
Tommy
,
for
now
she
abandoned
hope
of
his
attention
with
what
was
once
called
ill
grace
,
and
petulantly
crossed
the
crescent
of
the
deck
.
``
After
all
,
I
am
a
hero
,
''
Tommy
said
calmly
,
only
half
joking
.
``
I
have
ferocious
courage
,
usually
,
something
like
a
lion
,
something
like
a
drunken
man
.
''
Nicole
waited
until
the
echo
of
his
boast
had
died
away
in
his
mind
--
she
knew
he
had
probably
never
made
such
a
statement
before
.
Then
she
looked
among
the
strangers
,
and
found
as
usual
,
the
fierce
neurotics
,
pretending
calm
,
liking
the
country
only
in
horror
of
the
city
,
of
the
sound
of
their
own
voices
which
had
set
the
tone
and
pitch
.
.
.
.
She
asked
:
``
Who
is
the
woman
in
white
?
''
``
The
one
who
was
beside
me
?
Lady
Caroline
Sibly-Biers
.
''
--
They
listened
for
a
moment
to
her
voice
across
the
way
:
``
The
man
's
a
scoundrel
,
but
he
's
a
cat
of
the
stripe
.
We
sat
up
all
night
playing
two-handed
chemin-de-fer
,
and
he
owes
me
a
mille
Swiss
.
''
Tommy
laughed
and
said
:
``
She
is
now
the
wickedest
woman
in
London
--
whenever
I
come
back
to
Europe
there
is
a
new
crop
of
the
wickedest
women
from
London
.
She
's
the
very
latest
--
though
I
believe
there
is
now
one
other
who
's
considered
almost
as
wicked
.
''
Nicole
glanced
again
at
the
woman
across
the
deck
--
she
was
fragile
,
tubercular
--
it
was
incredible
that
such
narrow
shoulders
,
such
puny
arms
could
bear
aloft
the
pennon
of
decadence
,
last
ensign
of
the
fading
empire
.
Her
resemblance
was
rather
to
one
of
John
Held
's
flat-chested
flappers
than
to
the
hierarchy
of
tall
languid
blondes
who
had
posed
for
painters
and
novelists
since
before
the
war
.
Golding
approached
,
fighting
down
the
resonance
of
his
huge
bulk
,
which
transmitted
his
will
as
through
a
gargantuan
amplifier
,
and
Nicole
,
still
reluctant
,
yielded
to
his
reiterated
points
:
that
the
Margin
was
starting
for
Cannes
immediately
after
dinner
;
that
they
could
always
pack
in
some
caviare
and
champagne
,
even
though
they
had
dined
;
that
in
any
case
Dick
was
now
on
the
phone
,
telling
their
chauffeur
in
Nice
to
drive
their
car
back
to
Cannes
and
leave
it
in
front
of
the
Café
des
Alliées
where
the
Divers
could
retrieve
it
.
They
moved
into
the
dining
salon
and
Dick
was
placed
next
to
Lady
Sibly-Biers
.
Nicole
saw
that
his
usually
ruddy
face
was
drained
of
blood
;
he
talked
in
a
dogmatic
voice
,
of
which
only
snatches
reached
Nicole
:
``
.
.
.
It
's
all
right
for
you
English
,
you
're
doing
a
dance
of
death
.
.
.
.
Sepoys
in
the
ruined
fort
,
I
mean
Sepoys
at
the
gate
and
gaiety
in
the
fort
and
all
that
.
The
green
hat
,
the
crushed
hat
,
no
future
.
''
Lady
Caroline
answered
him
in
short
sentences
spotted
with
the
terminal
``
What
?
''
the
double-edged
``
Quite
!
''
the
depressing
``
Cheerio
!
''
that
always
had
a
connotation
of
imminent
peril
,
but
Dick
appeared
oblivious
to
the
warning
signals
.
Suddenly
he
made
a
particularly
vehement
pronouncement
,
the
purport
of
which
eluded
Nicole
,
but
she
saw
the
young
woman
turn
dark
and
sinewy
,
and
heard
her
answer
sharply
:
``
After
all
a
chep
's
a
chep
and
a
chum
's
a
chum
.
''
Again
he
had
offended
some
one
--
could
n't
he
hold
his
tongue
a
little
longer
?
How
long
?
To
death
then
.
At
the
piano
,
a
fair-haired
young
Scotsman
from
the
orchestra
(
entitled
by
its
drum
``
The
Ragtime
College
Jazzes
of
Edinboro
''
)
had
begun
singing
in
a
Danny
Deever
monotone
,
accompanying
himself
with
low
chords
on
the
piano
.
He
pronounced
his
words
with
great
precision
,
as
though
they
impressed
him
almost
intolerably
.
``
There
was
a
young
lady
from
hell
,
Who
jumped
at
the
sound
of
a
bell
,
Because
she
was
bad
--
bad
--
bad
,
She
jumped
at
the
sound
of
a
bell
,
From
hell
(
BOOMBOOM
)
From
hell
(
TOOTTOOT
)
There
was
a
young
lady
from
hell
--
''
``
What
is
all
this
?
''
whispered
Tommy
to
Nicole
.
The
girl
on
the
other
side
of
him
supplied
the
answer
:
``
Caroline
Sibly-Biers
wrote
the
words
.
He
wrote
the
music
.
''
``
Quelle
enfanterie
!
''
Tommy
murmured
as
the
next
verse
began
,
hinting
at
the
jumpy
lady
's
further
predilections
.
``
On
dirait
qu'il
récite
Racine
!
''
On
the
surface
at
least
,
Lady
Caroline
was
paying
no
attention
to
the
performance
of
her
work
.
Glancing
at
her
again
Nicole
found
herself
impressed
,
neither
with
the
character
nor
the
personality
,
but
with
the
sheer
strength
derived
from
an
attitude
;
Nicole
thought
that
she
was
formidable
,
and
she
was
confirmed
in
this
point
of
view
as
the
party
rose
from
table
.
Dick
remained
in
his
seat
wearing
an
odd
expression
;
then
he
crashed
into
words
with
a
harsh
ineptness
.
``
I
do
n't
like
innuendo
in
these
deafening
English
whispers
.
''
Already
half-way
out
of
the
room
Lady
Caroline
turned
and
walked
back
to
him
;
she
spoke
in
a
low
clipped
voice
purposely
audible
to
the
whole
company
.
``
You
came
to
me
asking
for
it
--
disparaging
my
countrymen
,
disparaging
my
friend
,
Mary
Minghetti
.
I
simply
said
you
were
observed
associating
with
a
questionable
crowd
in
Lausanne
.
Is
that
a
deafening
whisper
?
Or
does
it
simply
deafen
you
?
''
``
It
's
still
not
loud
enough
,
''
said
Dick
,
a
little
too
late
.
``
So
I
am
actually
a
notorious
--
''
Golding
crushed
out
the
phrase
with
his
voice
saying
:
``
What
!
What
!
''
and
moved
his
guests
on
out
,
with
the
threat
of
his
powerful
body
.
Turning
the
corner
of
the
door
Nicole
saw
that
Dick
was
still
sitting
at
the
table
.
She
was
furious
at
the
woman
for
her
preposterous
statement
,
equally
furious
at
Dick
for
having
brought
them
here
,
for
having
become
fuddled
,
for
having
untipped
the
capped
barbs
of
his
irony
,
for
having
come
off
humiliated
--
she
was
a
little
more
annoyed
because
she
knew
that
her
taking
possession
of
Tommy
Barban
on
their
arrival
had
first
irritated
the
Englishwoman
.
A
moment
later
she
saw
Dick
standing
in
the
gangway
,
apparently
in
complete
control
of
himself
as
he
talked
with
Golding
;
then
for
half
an
hour
she
did
not
see
him
anywhere
about
the
deck
and
she
broke
out
of
an
intricate
Malay
game
,
played
with
string
and
coffee
beans
,
and
said
to
Tommy
:
``
I
've
got
to
find
Dick
.
''
Since
dinner
the
yacht
had
been
in
motion
westward
.
The
fine
night
streamed
away
on
either
side
,
the
Diesel
engines
pounded
softly
,
there
was
a
spring
wind
that
blew
Nicole
's
hair
abruptly
when
she
reached
the
bow
,
and
she
had
a
sharp
lesion
of
anxiety
at
seeing
Dick
standing
in
the
angle
by
the
flagstaff
.
His
voice
was
serene
as
he
recognized
her
.
``
It
's
a
nice
night
.
''
``
I
was
worried
.
''
``
Oh
,
you
were
worried
?
''
``
Oh
,
do
n't
talk
that
way
.
It
would
give
me
so
much
pleasure
to
think
of
a
little
something
I
could
do
for
you
,
Dick
.
''
He
turned
away
from
her
,
toward
the
veil
of
starlight
over
Africa
.
``
I
believe
that
's
true
,
Nicole
.
And
sometimes
I
believe
that
the
littler
it
was
,
the
more
pleasure
it
would
give
you
.
''
``
Do
n't
talk
like
that
--
do
n't
say
such
things
.
''
His
face
,
wan
in
the
light
that
the
white
spray
caught
and
tossed
back
to
the
brilliant
sky
had
none
of
the
lines
of
annoyance
she
had
expected
.
It
was
even
detached
;
his
eyes
focussed
upon
her
gradually
as
upon
a
chessman
to
be
moved
;
in
the
same
slow
manner
he
caught
her
wrist
and
drew
her
near
.
``
You
ruined
me
,
did
you
?
''
he
inquired
blandly
.
``
Then
we
're
both
ruined
.
So
--
''
Cold
with
terror
she
put
her
other
wrist
into
his
grip
.
All
right
,
she
would
go
with
him
--
again
she
felt
the
beauty
of
the
night
vividly
in
one
moment
of
complete
response
and
abnegation
--
all
right
,
then
--
--
but
now
she
was
unexpectedly
free
and
Dick
turned
his
back
sighing
.
``
Tch
!
tch
!
''
Tears
streamed
down
Nicole
's
face
--
in
a
moment
she
heard
some
one
approaching
;
it
was
Tommy
.
``
You
found
him
!
Nicole
thought
maybe
you
jumped
overboard
,
Dick
,
''
he
said
,
``
because
that
little
English
poule
slanged
you
.
''
``
It
'd
be
a
good
setting
to
jump
overboard
,
''
said
Dick
mildly
.
``
Would
n't
it
?
''
agreed
Nicole
hastily
.
``
Let
's
borrow
life-preservers
and
jump
over
.
I
think
we
should
do
something
spectacular
.
I
feel
that
all
our
lives
have
been
too
restrained
.
''
Tommy
sniffed
from
one
to
the
other
trying
to
breathe
in
the
situation
with
the
night
.
``
We
'll
go
ask
the
Lady
Beer-and-Ale
what
to
do
--
she
should
know
the
latest
things
.
And
we
should
memorize
her
song
'There
was
a
young
lady
from
l'enfer
.
'
I
shall
translate
it
,
and
make
a
fortune
from
its
success
at
the
Casino
.
''
``
Are
you
rich
,
Tommy
?
''
Dick
asked
him
,
as
they
retraced
the
length
of
the
boat
.
``
Not
as
things
go
now
.
I
got
tired
of
the
brokerage
business
and
went
away
.
But
I
have
good
stocks
in
the
hands
of
friends
who
are
holding
it
for
me
.
All
goes
well
.
''
``
Dick
's
getting
rich
,
''
Nicole
said
.
In
reaction
her
voice
had
begun
to
tremble
.
On
the
after
deck
Golding
had
fanned
three
pairs
of
dancers
into
action
with
his
colossal
paws
.
Nicole
and
Tommy
joined
them
and
Tommy
remarked
:
``
Dick
seems
to
be
drinking
.
''
``
Only
moderately
,
''
she
said
loyally
.
``
There
are
those
who
can
drink
and
those
who
ca
n't
.
Obviously
Dick
ca
n't
.
You
ought
to
tell
him
not
to
.
''
``
I
!
''
she
exclaimed
in
amazement
.
``
I
tell
Dick
what
he
should
do
or
should
n't
do
!
''
But
in
a
reticent
way
Dick
was
still
vague
and
sleepy
when
they
reached
the
pier
at
Cannes
.
Golding
buoyed
him
down
into
the
launch
of
the
Margin
whereupon
Lady
Caroline
shifted
her
place
conspicuously
.
On
the
dock
he
bowed
good-by
with
exaggerated
formality
,
and
for
a
moment
he
seemed
about
to
speed
her
with
a
salty
epigram
,
but
the
bone
of
Tommy
's
arm
went
into
the
soft
part
of
his
and
they
walked
to
the
attendant
car
.
``
I
'll
drive
you
home
,
''
Tommy
suggested
.
``
Do
n't
bother
--
we
can
get
a
cab
.
''
``
I
'd
like
to
,
if
you
can
put
me
up
.
''
On
the
back
seat
of
the
car
Dick
remained
quiescent
until
the
yellow
monolith
of
Golfe
Juan
was
passed
,
and
then
the
constant
carnival
at
Juan
les
Pins
where
the
night
was
musical
and
strident
in
many
languages
.
When
the
car
turned
up
the
hill
toward
Tarmes
,
he
sat
up
suddenly
,
prompted
by
the
tilt
of
the
vehicle
and
delivered
a
peroration
:
``
A
charming
representative
of
the
--
''
he
stumbled
momentarily
,
``
--
a
firm
of
--
bring
me
Brains
addled
a
l'Anglaise
.
''
Then
he
went
into
an
appeased
sleep
,
belching
now
and
then
contentedly
into
the
soft
warm
darkness
.
VI
Next
morning
Dick
came
early
into
Nicole
's
room
.
``
I
waited
till
I
heard
you
up
.
Needless
to
say
I
feel
badly
about
the
evening
--
but
how
about
no
postmortems
?
''
``
I
'm
agreed
,
''
she
answered
coolly
,
carrying
her
face
to
the
mirror
.
``
Tommy
drove
us
home
?
Or
did
I
dream
it
?
''
``
You
know
he
did
.
''
``
Seems
probable
,
''
he
admitted
,
``
since
I
just
heard
him
coughing
.
I
think
I
'll
call
on
him
.
''
She
was
glad
when
he
left
her
,
for
almost
the
first
time
in
her
life
--
his
awful
faculty
of
being
right
seemed
to
have
deserted
him
at
last
.
Tommy
was
stirring
in
his
bed
,
waking
for
café
au
lait
.
``
Feel
all
right
?
''
Dick
asked
.
When
Tommy
complained
of
a
sore
throat
he
seized
at
a
professional
attitude
.
``
Better
have
a
gargle
or
something
.
''
``
You
have
one
?
''
``
Oddly
enough
I
have
n't
--
probably
Nicole
has
.
''
``
Do
n't
disturb
her
.
''
``
She
's
up
.
''
``
How
is
she
?
''
Dick
turned
around
slowly
.
``
Did
you
expect
her
to
be
dead
because
I
was
tight
?
''
His
tone
was
pleasant
.
``
Nicole
is
now
made
of
--
of
Georgia
pine
,
which
is
the
hardest
wood
known
,
except
lignum
vitæ
from
New
Zealand
--
''
Nicole
,
going
downstairs
,
heard
the
end
of
the
conversation
.
She
knew
,
as
she
had
always
known
,
that
Tommy
loved
her
;
she
knew
he
had
come
to
dislike
Dick
,
and
that
Dick
had
realized
it
before
he
did
,
and
would
react
in
some
positive
way
to
the
man
's
lonely
passion
.
This
thought
was
succeeded
by
a
moment
of
sheerly
feminine
satisfaction
.
She
leaned
over
her
children
's
breakfast
table
and
told
off
instructions
to
the
governess
,
while
upstairs
two
men
were
concerned
about
her
.
Later
in
the
garden
she
was
happy
;
she
did
not
want
anything
to
happen
,
but
only
for
the
situation
to
remain
in
suspension
as
the
two
men
tossed
her
from
one
mind
to
another
;
she
had
not
existed
for
a
long
time
,
even
as
a
ball
.
``
Nice
,
Rabbits
,
is
n't
it
--
Or
is
it
?
Hey
,
Rabbit
--
hey
you
!
Is
it
nice
?
--
hey
?
Or
does
it
sound
very
peculiar
to
you
?
''
The
rabbit
,
after
an
experience
of
practically
nothing
else
and
cabbage
leaves
,
agreed
after
a
few
tentative
shiftings
of
the
nose
.
Nicole
went
on
through
her
garden
routine
.
She
left
the
flowers
she
cut
in
designated
spots
to
be
brought
to
the
house
later
by
the
gardener
.
Reaching
the
sea
wall
she
fell
into
a
communicative
mood
and
no
one
to
communicate
with
;
so
she
stopped
and
deliberated
.
She
was
somewhat
shocked
at
the
idea
of
being
interested
in
another
man
--
but
other
women
have
lovers
--
why
not
me
?
In
the
fine
spring
morning
the
inhibitions
of
the
male
world
disappeared
and
she
reasoned
as
gaily
as
a
flower
,
while
the
wind
blew
her
hair
until
her
head
moved
with
it
.
Other
women
have
had
lovers
--
the
same
forces
that
last
night
had
made
her
yield
to
Dick
up
to
the
point
of
death
,
now
kept
her
head
nodding
to
the
wind
,
content
and
happy
with
the
logic
of
,
Why
should
n't
I
?
She
sat
upon
the
low
wall
and
looked
down
upon
the
sea
.
But
from
another
sea
,
the
wide
swell
of
fantasy
,
she
had
fished
out
something
tangible
to
lay
beside
the
rest
of
her
loot
.
If
she
need
not
,
in
her
spirit
,
be
forever
one
with
Dick
as
he
had
appeared
last
night
,
she
must
be
something
in
addition
,
not
just
an
image
on
his
mind
,
condemned
to
endless
parades
around
the
circumference
of
a
medal
.
Nicole
had
chosen
this
part
of
the
wall
on
which
to
sit
,
because
the
cliff
shaded
to
a
slanting
meadow
with
a
cultivated
vegetable
garden
.
Through
a
cluster
of
boughs
she
saw
two
men
carrying
rakes
and
spades
and
talking
in
a
counterpoint
of
Niçoise
and
Provençal
.
Attracted
by
their
words
and
gestures
she
caught
the
sense
:
``
I
laid
her
down
here
.
''
``
I
took
her
behind
the
vines
there
.
''
``
She
does
n't
care
--
neither
does
he
.
It
was
that
sacred
dog
.
Well
,
I
laid
her
down
here
--
''
``
You
got
the
rake
?
''
``
You
got
it
yourself
,
you
clown
.
''
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
care
where
you
laid
her
down
.
Until
that
night
I
never
even
felt
a
woman
's
breast
against
my
chest
since
I
married
--
twelve
years
ago
.
And
now
you
tell
me
--
''
``
But
listen
about
the
dog
--
''
Nicole
watched
them
through
the
boughs
;
it
seemed
all
right
what
they
were
saying
--
one
thing
was
good
for
one
person
,
another
for
another
.
Yet
it
was
a
man
's
world
she
had
overheard
;
going
back
to
the
house
she
became
doubtful
again
.
Dick
and
Tommy
were
on
the
terrace
.
She
walked
through
them
and
into
the
house
,
brought
out
a
sketch
pad
and
began
a
head
of
Tommy
.
``
Hands
never
idle
--
distaff
flying
,
''
Dick
said
lightly
.
How
could
he
talk
so
trivially
with
the
blood
still
drained
down
from
his
cheeks
so
that
the
auburn
lather
of
beard
showed
red
as
his
eyes
?
She
turned
to
Tommy
saying
:
``
I
can
always
do
something
.
I
used
to
have
a
nice
active
little
Polynesian
ape
and
juggle
him
around
for
hours
till
people
began
to
make
the
most
dismal
rough
jokes
--
''
She
kept
her
eyes
resolutely
away
from
Dick
.
Presently
he
excused
himself
and
went
inside
--
she
saw
him
pour
himself
two
glasses
of
water
,
and
she
hardened
further
.
``
Nicole
--
''
Tommy
began
but
interrupted
himself
to
clear
the
harshness
from
his
throat
.
``
I
'm
going
to
get
you
some
special
camphor
rub
,
''
she
suggested
.
``
It
's
American
--
Dick
believes
in
it
.
I
'll
be
just
a
minute
.
''
``
I
must
go
really
.
''
Dick
came
out
and
sat
down
.
``
Believes
in
what
?
''
When
she
returned
with
the
jar
neither
of
the
men
had
moved
,
though
she
gathered
they
had
had
some
sort
of
excited
conversation
about
nothing
.
The
chauffeur
was
at
the
door
,
with
a
bag
containing
Tommy
's
clothes
of
the
night
before
.
The
sight
of
Tommy
in
clothes
borrowed
from
Dick
moved
her
sadly
,
falsely
,
as
though
Tommy
were
not
able
to
afford
such
clothes
.
``
When
you
get
to
the
hotel
rub
this
into
your
throat
and
chest
and
then
inhale
it
,
''
she
said
.
``
Say
,
there
,
''
Dick
murmured
as
Tommy
went
down
the
steps
,
``
do
n't
give
Tommy
the
whole
jar
--
it
has
to
be
ordered
from
Paris
--
it
's
out
of
stock
down
here
.
''
Tommy
came
back
within
hearing
and
the
three
of
them
stood
in
the
sunshine
,
Tommy
squarely
before
the
car
so
that
it
seemed
by
leaning
forward
he
would
tip
it
upon
his
back
.
Nicole
stepped
down
to
the
path
.
``
Now
catch
it
,
''
she
advised
him
.
``
It
's
extremely
rare
.
''
She
heard
Dick
grow
silent
at
her
side
;
she
took
a
step
off
from
him
and
waved
as
the
car
drove
off
with
Tommy
and
the
special
camphor
rub
.
Then
she
turned
to
take
her
own
medicine
.
``
There
was
no
necessity
for
that
gesture
,
''
Dick
said
.
``
There
are
four
of
us
here
--
and
for
years
whenever
there
's
a
cough
--
''
They
looked
at
each
other
.
``
We
can
always
get
another
jar
--
''
then
she
lost
her
nerve
and
presently
followed
him
upstairs
where
he
lay
down
on
his
own
bed
and
said
nothing
.
``
Do
you
want
lunch
to
be
brought
up
to
you
?
''
she
asked
.
He
nodded
and
continued
to
lie
quiescent
,
staring
at
the
ceiling
.
Doubtfully
she
went
to
give
the
order
.
Upstairs
again
she
looked
into
his
room
--
the
blue
eyes
,
like
searchlights
,
played
on
a
dark
sky
.
She
stood
a
minute
in
the
doorway
,
aware
of
the
sin
she
had
committed
against
him
,
half
afraid
to
come
in
.
.
.
.
She
put
out
her
hand
as
if
to
rub
his
head
,
but
he
turned
away
like
a
suspicious
animal
.
Nicole
could
stand
the
situation
no
longer
;
in
a
kitchen-maid
's
panic
she
ran
downstairs
,
afraid
of
what
the
stricken
man
above
would
feed
on
while
she
must
still
continue
her
dry
suckling
at
his
lean
chest
.
In
a
week
Nicole
forgot
her
flash
about
Tommy
--
she
had
not
much
memory
for
people
and
forgot
them
easily
.
But
in
the
first
hot
blast
of
June
she
heard
he
was
in
Nice
.
He
wrote
a
little
note
to
them
both
--
and
she
opened
it
under
the
parasol
,
together
with
other
mail
they
had
brought
from
the
house
.
After
reading
it
she
tossed
it
over
to
Dick
,
and
in
exchange
he
threw
a
telegram
into
the
lap
of
her
beach
pajamas
:
Dears
will
be
at
Gausses
to-morrow
unfortunately
without
mother
am
counting
on
seeing
you
.
``
I
'll
be
glad
to
see
her
,
''
said
Nicole
,
grimly
.
VII
But
she
went
to
the
beach
with
Dick
next
morning
with
a
renewal
of
her
apprehension
that
Dick
was
contriving
at
some
desperate
solution
.
Since
the
evening
on
Golding
's
yacht
she
had
sensed
what
was
going
on
.
So
delicately
balanced
was
she
between
an
old
foothold
that
had
always
guaranteed
her
security
,
and
the
imminence
of
a
leap
from
which
she
must
alight
changed
in
the
very
chemistry
of
blood
and
muscle
,
that
she
did
not
dare
bring
the
matter
into
the
true
forefront
of
consciousness
.
The
figures
of
Dick
and
herself
,
mutating
,
undefined
,
appeared
as
spooks
caught
up
into
a
fantastic
dance
.
For
months
every
word
had
seemed
to
have
an
overtone
of
some
other
meaning
,
soon
to
be
resolved
under
circumstances
that
Dick
would
determine
.
Though
this
state
of
mind
was
perhaps
more
hopeful
,
--
the
long
years
of
sheer
being
had
had
an
enlivening
effect
on
the
parts
of
her
nature
that
early
illness
had
killed
,
that
Dick
had
not
reached
--
through
no
fault
of
his
but
simply
because
no
one
nature
can
extend
entirely
inside
another
--
it
was
still
disquieting
.
The
most
unhappy
aspect
of
their
relations
was
Dick
's
growing
indifference
,
at
present
personified
by
too
much
drink
;
Nicole
did
not
know
whether
she
was
to
be
crushed
or
spared
--
Dick
's
voice
,
throbbing
with
insincerity
,
confused
the
issue
;
she
could
n't
guess
how
he
was
going
to
behave
next
upon
the
tortuously
slow
unrolling
of
the
carpet
,
nor
what
would
happen
at
the
end
,
at
the
moment
of
the
leap
.
For
what
might
occur
thereafter
she
had
no
anxiety
--
she
suspected
that
that
would
be
the
lifting
of
a
burden
,
an
unblinding
of
eyes
.
Nicole
had
been
designed
for
change
,
for
flight
,
with
money
as
fins
and
wings
.
The
new
state
of
things
would
be
no
more
than
if
a
racing
chassis
,
concealed
for
years
under
the
body
of
a
family
limousine
,
should
be
stripped
to
its
original
self
.
Nicole
could
feel
the
fresh
breeze
already
--
the
wrench
it
was
she
feared
,
and
the
dark
manner
of
its
coming
.
The
Divers
went
out
on
the
beach
with
her
white
suit
and
his
white
trunks
very
white
against
the
color
of
their
bodies
.
Nicole
saw
Dick
peer
about
for
the
children
among
the
confused
shapes
and
shadows
of
many
umbrellas
,
and
as
his
mind
temporarily
left
her
,
ceasing
to
grip
her
,
she
looked
at
him
with
detachment
,
and
decided
that
he
was
seeking
his
children
,
not
protectively
but
for
protection
.
Probably
it
was
the
beach
he
feared
,
like
a
deposed
ruler
secretly
visiting
an
old
court
.
She
had
come
to
hate
his
world
with
its
delicate
jokes
and
politenesses
,
forgetting
that
for
many
years
it
was
the
only
world
open
to
her
.
Let
him
look
at
it
--
his
beach
,
perverted
now
to
the
tastes
of
the
tasteless
;
he
could
search
it
for
a
day
and
find
no
stone
of
the
Chinese
Wall
he
had
once
erected
around
it
,
no
footprint
of
an
old
friend
.
For
a
moment
Nicole
was
sorry
it
was
so
;
remembering
the
glass
he
had
raked
out
of
the
old
trash
heap
,
remembering
the
sailor
trunks
and
sweaters
they
had
bought
in
a
Nice
back
street
--
garments
that
afterward
ran
through
a
vogue
in
silk
among
the
Paris
couturiers
,
remembering
the
simple
little
French
girls
climbing
on
the
breakwaters
crying
``
Dites
donc
!
Dites
donc
!
''
like
birds
,
and
the
ritual
of
the
morning
time
,
the
quiet
restful
extraversion
toward
sea
and
sun
--
many
inventions
of
his
,
buried
deeper
than
the
sand
under
the
span
of
so
few
years
.
.
.
.
Now
the
swimming
place
was
a
``
club
,
''
though
,
like
the
international
society
it
represented
,
it
would
be
hard
to
say
who
was
not
admitted
.
Nicole
hardened
again
as
Dick
knelt
on
the
straw
mat
and
looked
about
for
Rosemary
.
Her
eyes
followed
his
,
searching
among
the
new
paraphernalia
,
the
trapezes
over
the
water
,
the
swinging
rings
,
the
portable
bathhouses
,
the
floating
towers
,
the
searchlights
from
last
night
's
fêtes
,
the
modernistic
buffet
,
white
with
a
hackneyed
motif
of
endless
handlebars
.
The
water
was
almost
the
last
place
he
looked
for
Rosemary
,
because
few
people
swam
any
more
in
that
blue
paradise
,
children
and
one
exhibitionistic
valet
who
punctuated
the
morning
with
spectacular
dives
from
a
fifty-foot
rock
--
most
of
Gausse
's
guests
stripped
the
concealing
pajamas
from
their
flabbiness
only
for
a
short
hangover
dip
at
one
o'clock
.
``
There
she
is
,
''
Nicole
remarked
.
She
watched
Dick
's
eyes
following
Rosemary
's
track
from
raft
to
raft
;
but
the
sigh
that
rocked
out
of
her
bosom
was
something
left
over
from
five
years
ago
.
``
Let
's
swim
out
and
speak
to
Rosemary
,
''
he
suggested
.
``
You
go
.
''
``
We
'll
both
go
.
''
She
struggled
a
moment
against
his
pronouncement
,
but
eventually
they
swam
out
together
,
tracing
Rosemary
by
the
school
of
little
fish
who
followed
her
,
taking
their
dazzle
from
her
,
the
shining
spoon
of
a
trout
hook
.
Nicole
stayed
in
the
water
while
Dick
hoisted
himself
up
beside
Rosemary
,
and
the
two
sat
dripping
and
talking
,
exactly
as
if
they
had
never
loved
or
touched
each
other
.
Rosemary
was
beautiful
--
her
youth
was
a
shock
to
Nicole
,
who
rejoiced
,
however
,
that
the
young
girl
was
less
slender
by
a
hairline
than
herself
.
Nicole
swam
around
in
little
rings
,
listening
to
Rosemary
who
was
acting
amusement
,
joy
,
and
expectation
--
more
confident
than
she
had
been
five
years
ago
.
``
I
miss
Mother
so
,
but
she
's
meeting
me
in
Paris
,
Monday
.
''
``
Five
years
ago
you
came
here
,
''
said
Dick
.
``
And
what
a
funny
little
thing
you
were
,
in
one
of
those
hotel
peignoirs
!
''
``
How
you
remember
things
!
You
always
did
--
and
always
the
nice
things
.
''
Nicole
saw
the
old
game
of
flattery
beginning
again
and
she
dove
under
water
,
coming
up
again
to
hear
:
``
I
'm
going
to
pretend
it
's
five
years
ago
and
I
'm
a
girl
of
eighteen
again
.
You
could
always
make
me
feel
some
you
know
,
kind
of
,
you
know
,
kind
of
happy
way
--
you
and
Nicole
.
I
feel
as
if
you
're
still
on
the
beach
there
,
under
one
of
those
umbrellas
--
the
nicest
people
I
'd
ever
known
,
maybe
ever
will
.
''
Swimming
away
,
Nicole
saw
that
the
cloud
of
Dick
's
heart-sickness
had
lifted
a
little
as
he
began
to
play
with
Rosemary
,
bringing
out
his
old
expertness
with
people
,
a
tarnished
object
of
art
;
she
guessed
that
with
a
drink
or
so
he
would
have
done
his
stunts
on
the
swinging
rings
for
her
,
fumbling
through
stunts
he
had
once
done
with
ease
.
She
noticed
that
this
summer
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
avoided
high
diving
.
Later
,
as
she
dodged
her
way
from
raft
to
raft
,
Dick
overtook
her
.
``
Some
of
Rosemary
's
friends
have
a
speed
boat
,
the
one
out
there
.
Do
you
want
to
aquaplane
?
I
think
it
would
be
amusing
.
''
Remembering
that
once
he
could
stand
on
his
hands
on
a
chair
at
the
end
of
a
board
,
she
indulged
him
as
she
might
have
indulged
Lanier
.
Last
summer
on
the
Zugersee
they
had
played
at
that
pleasant
water
game
,
and
Dick
had
lifted
a
two-hundred-pound
man
from
the
board
onto
his
shoulders
and
stood
up
.
But
women
marry
all
their
husbands
'
talents
and
naturally
,
afterwards
,
are
not
so
impressed
with
them
as
they
may
keep
up
the
pretense
of
being
.
Nicole
had
not
even
pretended
to
be
impressed
,
though
she
had
said
``
Yes
''
to
him
,
and
``
Yes
,
I
thought
so
too
.
''
She
knew
,
though
,
that
he
was
somewhat
tired
,
that
it
was
only
the
closeness
of
Rosemary
's
exciting
youth
that
prompted
the
impending
effort
--
she
had
seen
him
draw
the
same
inspiration
from
the
new
bodies
of
her
children
and
she
wondered
coldly
if
he
would
make
a
spectacle
of
himself
.
The
Divers
were
older
than
the
others
in
the
boat
--
the
young
people
were
polite
,
deferential
,
but
Nicole
felt
an
undercurrent
of
``
Who
are
these
Numbers
anyhow
?
''
and
she
missed
Dick
's
easy
talent
of
taking
control
of
situations
and
making
them
all
right
--
he
had
concentrated
on
what
he
was
going
to
try
to
do
.
The
motor
throttled
down
two
hundred
yards
from
shore
and
one
of
the
young
men
dove
flat
over
the
edge
.
He
swam
at
the
aimless
twisting
board
,
steadied
it
,
climbed
slowly
to
his
knees
on
it
--
then
got
on
his
feet
as
the
boat
accelerated
.
Leaning
back
he
swung
his
light
vehicle
ponderously
from
side
to
side
in
slow
,
breathless
arcs
that
rode
the
trailing
side-swell
at
the
end
of
each
swing
.
In
the
direct
wake
of
the
boat
he
let
go
his
rope
,
balanced
for
a
moment
,
then
back-flipped
into
the
water
,
disappearing
like
a
statue
of
glory
,
and
reappearing
as
an
insignificant
head
while
the
boat
made
the
circle
back
to
him
.
Nicole
refused
her
turn
;
then
Rosemary
rode
the
board
neatly
and
conservatively
,
with
facetious
cheers
from
her
admirers
.
Three
of
them
scrambled
egotistically
for
the
honor
of
pulling
her
into
the
boat
,
managing
,
among
them
,
to
bruise
her
knee
and
hip
against
the
side
.
``
Now
you
.
Doctor
,
''
said
the
Mexican
at
the
wheel
.
Dick
and
the
last
young
man
dove
over
the
side
and
swam
to
the
board
.
Dick
was
going
to
try
his
lifting
trick
and
Nicole
began
to
watch
with
smiling
scorn
.
This
physical
showing-off
for
Rosemary
irritated
her
most
of
all
.
When
the
men
had
ridden
long
enough
to
find
their
balance
,
Dick
knelt
,
and
putting
the
back
of
his
neck
in
the
other
man
's
crotch
,
found
the
rope
through
his
legs
,
and
slowly
began
to
rise
.
The
people
in
the
boat
,
watching
closely
,
saw
that
he
was
having
difficulties
.
He
was
on
one
knee
;
the
trick
was
to
straighten
all
the
way
up
in
the
same
motion
with
which
he
left
his
kneeling
position
.
He
rested
for
a
moment
,
then
his
face
contracted
as
he
put
his
heart
into
the
strain
,
and
lifted
.
The
board
was
narrow
,
the
man
,
though
weighing
less
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
,
was
awkward
with
his
weight
and
grabbed
clumsily
at
Dick
's
head
.
When
,
with
a
last
wrenching
effort
of
his
back
,
Dick
stood
upright
,
the
board
slid
sidewise
and
the
pair
toppled
into
the
sea
.
In
the
boat
Rosemary
exclaimed
:
``
Wonderful
!
They
almost
had
it
.
''
But
as
they
came
back
to
the
swimmers
Nicole
watched
for
a
sight
of
Dick
's
face
.
It
was
full
of
annoyance
as
she
expected
,
because
he
had
done
the
thing
with
ease
only
two
years
ago
.
The
second
time
he
was
more
careful
.
He
rose
a
little
testing
the
balance
of
his
burden
,
settled
down
again
on
his
knee
;
then
,
grunting
``
Alley
oop
!
''
began
to
rise
--
but
before
he
could
really
straighten
out
,
his
legs
suddenly
buckled
and
he
shoved
the
board
away
with
his
feet
to
avoid
being
struck
as
they
fell
off
.
This
time
when
the
Baby
Gar
came
back
it
was
apparent
to
all
the
passengers
that
he
was
angry
.
``
Do
you
mind
if
I
try
that
once
more
?
''
he
called
,
treading
water
.
``
We
almost
had
it
then
.
''
``
Sure
.
Go
ahead
.
''
To
Nicole
he
looked
white-around-the-gills
,
and
she
cautioned
him
:
``
Do
n't
you
think
that
's
enough
for
now
?
''
He
did
n't
answer
.
The
first
partner
had
had
plenty
and
was
hauled
over
the
side
,
the
Mexican
driving
the
motor
boat
obligingly
took
his
place
.
He
was
heavier
than
the
first
man
.
As
the
boat
gathered
motion
,
Dick
rested
for
a
moment
,
belly-down
on
the
board
.
Then
he
got
beneath
the
man
and
took
the
rope
,
and
his
muscles
flexed
as
he
tried
to
rise
.
He
could
not
rise
.
Nicole
saw
him
shift
his
position
and
strain
upward
again
but
at
the
instant
when
the
weight
of
his
partner
was
full
upon
his
shoulders
he
became
immovable
.
He
tried
again
--
lifting
an
inch
,
two
inches
--
Nicole
felt
the
sweat
glands
of
her
forehead
open
as
she
strained
with
him
--
then
he
was
simply
holding
his
ground
,
then
he
collapsed
back
down
on
his
knees
with
a
smack
,
and
they
went
over
,
Dick
's
head
barely
missing
a
kick
of
the
board
.
``
Hurry
back
!
''
Nicole
called
to
the
driver
;
even
as
she
spoke
she
saw
him
slide
under
water
and
she
gave
a
little
cry
;
but
he
came
up
again
and
turned
on
his
back
,
and
``
Château
''
swam
near
to
help
.
It
seemed
forever
till
the
boat
reached
them
but
when
they
came
alongside
at
last
and
Nicole
saw
Dick
floating
exhausted
and
expressionless
,
alone
with
the
water
and
the
sky
,
her
panic
changed
suddenly
to
contempt
.
``
We
'll
help
you
up
,
Doctor
.
.
.
.
Get
his
foot
.
.
.
all
right
.
.
.
now
altogether
.
.
.
.
''
Dick
sat
panting
and
looking
at
nothing
.
``
I
knew
you
should
n't
have
tried
it
,
''
Nicole
could
not
help
saying
.
``
He
'd
tired
himself
the
first
two
times
,
''
said
the
Mexican
.
``
It
was
a
foolish
thing
,
''
Nicole
insisted
.
Rosemary
tactfully
said
nothing
.
After
a
minute
Dick
got
his
breath
,
panting
,
``
I
could
n't
have
lifted
a
paper
doll
that
time
.
''
An
explosive
little
laugh
relieved
the
tension
caused
by
his
failure
.
They
were
all
attentive
to
Dick
as
he
disembarked
at
the
dock
.
But
Nicole
was
annoyed
--
everything
he
did
annoyed
her
now
.
She
sat
with
Rosemary
under
an
umbrella
while
Dick
went
to
the
buffet
for
a
drink
--
he
returned
presently
with
some
sherry
for
them
.
``
The
first
drink
I
ever
had
was
with
you
,
''
Rosemary
said
,
and
with
a
spurt
of
enthusiasm
she
added
,
``
Oh
,
I
'm
so
glad
to
see
you
and
know
you
're
all
right
.
I
was
worried
--
''
Her
sentence
broke
as
she
changed
direction
``
that
maybe
you
would
n't
be
.
''
``
Did
you
hear
I
'd
gone
into
a
process
of
deterioration
?
''
``
Oh
,
no
.
I
simply
--
just
heard
you
'd
changed
.
And
I
'm
glad
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
it
is
n't
true
.
''
``
It
is
true
,
''
Dick
answered
,
sitting
down
with
them
.
``
The
change
came
a
long
way
back
--
but
at
first
it
did
n't
show
.
The
manner
remains
intact
for
some
time
after
the
morale
cracks
.
''
``
Do
you
practise
on
the
Riviera
?
''
Rosemary
demanded
hastily
.
``
It
'd
be
a
good
ground
to
find
likely
specimens
.
''
He
nodded
here
and
there
at
the
people
milling
about
in
the
golden
sand
.
``
Great
candidates
.
Notice
our
old
friend
,
Mrs.
Abrams
,
playing
duchess
to
Mary
North
's
queen
?
Do
n't
get
jealous
about
it
--
think
of
Mrs.
Abram
's
long
climb
up
the
back
stairs
of
the
Ritz
on
her
hands
and
knees
and
all
the
carpet
dust
she
had
to
inhale
.
''
Rosemary
interrupted
him
.
``
But
is
that
really
Mary
North
?
''
She
was
regarding
a
woman
sauntering
in
their
direction
followed
by
a
small
group
who
behaved
as
if
they
were
accustomed
to
being
looked
at
.
When
they
were
ten
feet
away
,
Mary
's
glance
flickered
fractionally
over
the
Divers
,
one
of
those
unfortunate
glances
that
indicate
to
the
glanced-upon
that
they
have
been
observed
but
are
to
be
overlooked
,
the
sort
of
glance
that
neither
the
Divers
nor
Rosemary
Hoyt
had
ever
permitted
themselves
to
throw
at
any
one
in
their
lives
.
Dick
was
amused
when
Mary
perceived
Rosemary
,
changed
her
plans
and
came
over
.
She
spoke
to
Nicole
with
pleasant
heartiness
,
nodded
unsmilingly
to
Dick
as
if
he
were
somewhat
contagious
--
whereupon
he
bowed
in
ironic
respect
--
as
she
greeted
Rosemary
.
``
I
heard
you
were
here
.
For
how
long
?
''
``
Until
to-morrow
,
''
Rosemary
answered
.
She
,
too
,
saw
how
Mary
had
walked
through
the
Divers
to
talk
to
her
,
and
a
sense
of
obligation
kept
her
unenthusiastic
.
No
,
she
could
not
dine
to-night
.
Mary
turned
to
Nicole
,
her
manner
indicating
affection
blended
with
pity
.
``
How
are
the
children
?
''
she
asked
.
They
came
up
at
the
moment
,
and
Nicole
gave
ear
to
a
request
that
she
overrule
the
governess
on
a
swimming
point
.
``
No
,
''
Dick
answered
for
her
.
``
What
Mademoiselle
says
must
go
.
''
Agreeing
that
one
must
support
delegated
authority
,
Nicole
refused
their
request
,
whereupon
Mary
--
who
in
the
manner
of
an
Anita
Loos
'
heroine
had
dealings
only
with
Faits
Accomplis
,
who
indeed
could
not
have
house-broken
a
French
poodle
puppy
--
regarded
Dick
as
though
he
were
guilty
of
a
most
flagrant
bullying
.
Dick
,
chafed
by
the
tiresome
performance
,
inquired
with
mock
solicitude
:
``
How
are
your
children
--
and
their
aunts
?
''
Mary
did
not
answer
;
she
left
them
,
first
draping
a
sympathetic
hand
over
Lanier
's
reluctant
head
.
After
she
had
gone
Dick
said
:
``
When
I
think
of
the
time
I
spent
working
over
her
.
''
``
I
like
her
,
''
said
Nicole
.
Dick
's
bitterness
had
surprised
Rosemary
,
who
had
thought
of
him
as
all-forgiving
,
all-comprehending
.
Suddenly
she
recalled
what
it
was
she
had
heard
about
him
.
In
conversation
with
some
State
Department
people
on
the
boat
,
--
Europeanized
Americans
who
had
reached
a
position
where
they
could
scarcely
have
been
said
to
belong
to
any
nation
at
all
,
at
least
not
to
any
great
power
though
perhaps
to
a
Balkan-like
state
composed
of
similar
citizens
--
the
name
of
the
ubiquitously
renowned
Baby
Warren
had
occurred
and
it
was
remarked
that
Baby
's
younger
sister
had
thrown
herself
away
on
a
dissipated
doctor
.
``
He
's
not
received
anywhere
any
more
,
''
the
woman
said
.
The
phrase
disturbed
Rosemary
,
though
she
could
not
place
the
Divers
as
living
in
any
relation
to
society
where
such
a
fact
,
if
fact
it
was
,
could
have
any
meaning
,
yet
the
hint
of
a
hostile
and
organized
public
opinion
rang
in
her
ears
.
``
He
's
not
received
anywhere
any
more
.
''
She
pictured
Dick
climbing
the
steps
of
a
mansion
,
presenting
cards
and
being
told
by
a
butler
:
``
We
're
not
receiving
you
any
more
''
;
then
proceeding
down
an
avenue
only
to
be
told
the
same
thing
by
the
countless
other
butlers
of
countless
Ambassadors
,
Ministers
,
Chargés
d'Affaires
.
.
.
.
Nicole
wondered
how
she
could
get
away
.
She
guessed
that
Dick
,
stung
into
alertness
,
would
grow
charming
and
would
make
Rosemary
respond
to
him
.
Sure
enough
,
in
a
moment
his
voice
managed
to
qualify
everything
unpleasant
he
had
said
:
``
Mary
's
all
right
--
she
's
done
very
well
.
But
it
's
hard
to
go
on
liking
people
who
do
n't
like
you
.
''
Rosemary
,
falling
into
line
,
swayed
toward
Dick
and
crooned
:
``
Oh
,
you
're
so
nice
.
I
ca
n't
imagine
anybody
not
forgiving
you
anything
,
no
matter
what
you
did
to
them
.
''
Then
feeling
that
her
exuberance
had
transgressed
on
Nicole
's
rights
,
she
looked
at
the
sand
exactly
between
them
:
``
I
wanted
to
ask
you
both
what
you
thought
of
my
latest
pictures
--
if
you
saw
them
.
''
Nicole
said
nothing
,
having
seen
one
of
them
and
thought
little
about
it
.
``
It
'll
take
a
few
minutes
to
tell
you
,
''
Dick
said
.
``
Let
's
suppose
that
Nicole
says
to
you
that
Lanier
is
ill.
What
do
you
do
in
life
?
What
does
anyone
do
?
They
act
--
face
,
voice
,
words
--
the
face
shows
sorrow
,
the
voice
shows
shock
,
the
words
show
sympathy
.
''
``
Yes
--
I
understand
.
''
``
But
in
the
theatre
,
No
.
In
the
theatre
all
the
best
comediennes
have
built
up
their
reputations
by
burlesquing
the
correct
emotional
responses
--
fear
and
love
and
sympathy
.
''
``
I
see
.
''
Yet
she
did
not
quite
see
.
Losing
the
thread
of
it
,
Nicole
's
impatience
increased
as
Dick
continued
:
``
The
danger
to
an
actress
is
in
responding
.
Again
,
let
's
suppose
that
somebody
told
you
,
'Your
lover
is
dead
.
'
In
life
you
'd
probably
go
to
pieces
.
But
on
the
stage
you
're
trying
to
entertain
--
the
audience
can
do
the
'responding
'
for
themselves
.
First
the
actress
has
lines
to
follow
,
then
she
has
to
get
the
audience
's
attention
back
on
herself
,
away
from
the
murdered
Chinese
or
whatever
the
thing
is
.
So
she
must
do
something
unexpected
.
If
the
audience
thinks
the
character
is
hard
she
goes
soft
on
them
--
if
they
think
she
's
soft
she
goes
hard
.
You
go
all
out
of
character
--
you
understand
?
''
``
I
do
n't
quite
,
''
admitted
Rosemary
.
``
How
do
you
mean
out
of
character
?
''
``
You
do
the
unexpected
thing
until
you
've
manoeuvred
the
audience
back
from
the
objective
fact
to
yourself
.
Then
you
slide
into
character
again
.
''
Nicole
could
stand
no
more
.
She
stood
up
sharply
,
making
no
attempt
to
conceal
her
impatience
.
Rosemary
,
who
had
been
for
a
few
minutes
half-conscious
of
this
,
turned
in
a
conciliatory
way
to
Topsy
.
``
Would
you
like
to
be
an
actress
when
you
grow
up
?
I
think
you
'd
make
a
fine
actress
.
''
Nicole
stared
at
her
deliberately
and
in
her
grandfather
's
voice
said
,
slow
and
distinct
:
``
It
's
absolutely
out
to
put
such
ideas
in
the
heads
of
other
people
's
children
.
Remember
,
we
may
have
quite
different
plans
for
them
.
''
She
turned
sharply
to
Dick
.
``
I
'm
going
to
take
the
car
home
.
I
'll
send
Michelle
for
you
and
the
children
.
''
``
You
have
n't
driven
for
months
,
''
he
protested
.
``
I
have
n't
forgotten
how
.
''
Without
a
glance
at
Rosemary
whose
face
was
``
responding
''
violently
,
Nicole
left
the
umbrella
.
In
the
bathhouse
,
she
changed
to
pajamas
,
her
expression
still
hard
as
a
plaque
.
But
as
she
turned
into
the
road
of
arched
pines
and
the
atmosphere
changed
,
--
with
a
squirrel
's
flight
on
a
branch
,
a
wind
nudging
at
the
leaves
,
a
cock
splitting
distant
air
,
with
a
creep
of
sunlight
transpiring
through
the
immobility
,
then
the
voices
of
the
beach
receded
--
Nicole
relaxed
and
felt
new
and
happy
;
her
thoughts
were
clear
as
good
bells
--
she
had
a
sense
of
being
cured
and
in
a
new
way
.
Her
ego
began
blooming
like
a
great
rich
rose
as
she
scrambled
back
along
the
labyrinths
in
which
she
had
wandered
for
years
.
She
hated
the
beach
,
resented
the
places
where
she
had
played
planet
to
Dick
's
sun
.
``
Why
,
I
'm
almost
complete
,
''
she
thought
.
``
I
'm
practically
standing
alone
,
without
him
.
''
And
like
a
happy
child
,
wanting
the
completion
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
knowing
vaguely
that
Dick
had
planned
for
her
to
have
it
,
she
lay
on
her
bed
as
soon
as
she
got
home
and
wrote
Tommy
Barban
in
Nice
a
short
provocative
letter
.
But
that
was
for
the
daytime
--
toward
evening
with
the
inevitable
diminution
of
nervous
energy
,
her
spirits
flagged
,
and
the
arrows
flew
a
little
in
the
twilight
.
She
was
afraid
of
what
was
in
Dick
's
mind
;
again
she
felt
that
a
plan
underlay
his
current
actions
and
she
was
afraid
of
his
plans
--
they
worked
well
and
they
had
an
all-inclusive
logic
about
them
which
Nicole
was
not
able
to
command
.
She
had
somehow
given
over
the
thinking
to
him
,
and
in
his
absences
her
every
action
seemed
automatically
governed
by
what
he
would
like
,
so
that
now
she
felt
inadequate
to
match
her
intentions
against
his
.
Yet
think
she
must
;
she
knew
at
last
the
number
on
the
dreadful
door
of
fantasy
,
the
threshold
to
the
escape
that
was
no
escape
;
she
knew
that
for
her
the
greatest
sin
now
and
in
the
future
was
to
delude
herself
.
It
had
been
a
long
lesson
but
she
had
learned
it
.
Either
you
think
--
or
else
others
have
to
think
for
you
and
take
power
from
you
,
pervert
and
discipline
your
natural
tastes
,
civilize
and
sterilize
you
.
They
had
a
tranquil
supper
with
Dick
drinking
much
beer
and
being
cheerful
with
the
children
in
the
dusky
room
.
Afterward
he
played
some
Schubert
songs
and
some
new
jazz
from
America
that
Nicole
hummed
in
her
harsh
,
sweet
contralto
over
his
shoulder
.
``
Thank
y
'
father-r
Thank
y
'
mother-r
Thanks
for
meetingup
with
one
another
--
''
``
I
do
n't
like
that
one
,
''
Dick
said
,
starting
to
turn
the
page
.
``
Oh
,
play
it
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
Am
I
going
through
the
rest
of
life
flinching
at
the
word
'father
'
?
''
``
--
Thank
the
horse
that
pulled
the
buggy
that
night
!
Thank
you
both
for
being
justabit
tight
--
''
Later
they
sat
with
the
children
on
the
Moorish
roof
and
watched
the
fireworks
of
two
casinos
,
far
apart
,
far
down
on
the
shore
.
It
was
lonely
and
sad
to
be
so
empty-hearted
toward
each
other
.
Next
morning
,
back
from
shopping
in
Cannes
,
Nicole
found
a
note
saying
that
Dick
had
taken
the
small
car
and
gone
up
into
Provence
for
a
few
days
by
himself
.
Even
as
she
read
it
the
phone
rang
--
it
was
Tommy
Barban
from
Monte
Carlo
,
saying
that
he
had
received
her
letter
and
was
driving
over
.
She
felt
her
lips
'
warmth
in
the
receiver
as
she
welcomed
his
coming
.
VIII
She
bathed
and
anointed
herself
and
covered
her
body
with
a
layer
of
powder
,
while
her
toes
crunched
another
pile
on
a
bath
towel
.
She
looked
microscopically
at
the
lines
of
her
flanks
,
wondering
how
soon
the
fine
,
slim
edifice
would
begin
to
sink
squat
and
earthward
.
In
about
six
years
,
but
now
I
'll
do
--
in
fact
I
'll
do
as
well
as
any
one
I
know
.
She
was
not
exaggerating
.
The
only
physical
disparity
between
Nicole
at
present
and
the
Nicole
of
five
years
before
was
simply
that
she
was
no
longer
a
young
girl
.
But
she
was
enough
ridden
by
the
current
youth
worship
,
the
moving
pictures
with
their
myriad
faces
of
girl-children
,
blandly
represented
as
carrying
on
the
work
and
wisdom
of
the
world
,
to
feel
a
jealousy
of
youth
.
She
put
on
the
first
ankle-length
day
dress
that
she
had
owned
for
many
years
,
and
crossed
herself
reverently
with
Chanel
Sixteen
.
When
Tommy
drove
up
at
one
o'clock
she
had
made
her
person
into
the
trimmest
of
gardens
.
How
good
to
have
things
like
this
,
to
be
worshipped
again
,
to
pretend
to
have
a
mystery
!
She
had
lost
two
of
the
great
arrogant
years
in
the
life
of
a
pretty
girl
--
now
she
felt
like
making
up
for
them
;
she
greeted
Tommy
as
if
he
were
one
of
many
men
at
her
feet
,
walking
ahead
of
him
instead
of
beside
him
as
they
crossed
the
garden
toward
the
market
umbrella
.
Attractive
women
of
nineteen
and
of
twenty-nine
are
alike
in
their
breezy
confidence
;
on
the
contrary
,
the
exigent
womb
of
the
twenties
does
not
pull
the
outside
world
centripetally
around
itself
.
The
former
are
ages
of
insolence
,
comparable
the
one
to
a
young
cadet
,
the
other
to
a
fighter
strutting
after
combat
.
But
whereas
a
girl
of
nineteen
draws
her
confidence
from
a
surfeit
of
attention
,
a
woman
of
twenty-nine
is
nourished
on
subtler
stuff
.
Desirous
,
she
chooses
her
apéritifs
wisely
,
or
,
content
,
she
enjoys
the
caviare
of
potential
power
.
Happily
she
does
not
seem
,
in
either
case
,
to
anticipate
the
subsequent
years
when
her
insight
will
often
be
blurred
by
panic
,
by
the
fear
of
stopping
or
the
fear
of
going
on
.
But
on
the
landings
of
nineteen
or
twenty-nine
she
is
pretty
sure
that
there
are
no
bears
in
the
hall
.
Nicole
did
not
want
any
vague
spiritual
romance
--
she
wanted
an
``
affair
''
;
she
wanted
a
change
.
She
realized
,
thinking
with
Dick
's
thoughts
,
that
from
a
superficial
view
it
was
a
vulgar
business
to
enter
,
without
emotion
,
into
an
indulgence
that
menaced
all
of
them
.
On
the
other
hand
,
she
blamed
Dick
for
the
immediate
situation
,
and
honestly
thought
that
such
an
experiment
might
have
a
therapeutic
value
.
All
summer
she
had
been
stimulated
by
watching
people
do
exactly
what
they
were
tempted
to
do
and
pay
no
penalty
for
it
--
moreover
,
in
spite
of
her
intention
of
no
longer
lying
to
herself
,
she
preferred
to
consider
that
she
was
merely
feeling
her
way
and
that
at
any
moment
she
could
withdraw
.
.
.
.
In
the
light
shade
Tommy
caught
her
up
in
his
white-duck
arms
and
pulled
her
around
to
him
,
looking
at
her
eyes
.
``
Do
n't
move
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'm
going
to
look
at
you
a
great
deal
from
now
on
.
''
There
was
some
scent
on
his
hair
,
a
faint
aura
of
soap
from
his
white
clothes
.
Her
lips
were
tight
,
not
smiling
and
they
both
simply
looked
for
a
moment
.
``
Do
you
like
what
you
see
?
''
she
murmured
.
``
Parle
français
.
''
``
Very
well
,
''
and
she
asked
again
in
French
.
``
Do
you
like
what
you
see
?
''
He
pulled
her
closer
.
``
I
like
whatever
I
see
about
you
.
''
He
hesitated
.
``
I
thought
I
knew
your
face
but
it
seems
there
are
some
things
I
did
n't
know
about
it
.
When
did
you
begin
to
have
white
crook
's
eyes
?
''
She
broke
away
,
shocked
and
indignant
,
and
cried
in
English
:
``
Is
that
why
you
wanted
to
talk
French
?
''
Her
voice
quieted
as
the
butler
came
with
sherry
.
``
So
you
could
be
offensive
more
accurately
?
''
She
parked
her
small
seat
violently
on
the
cloth-of-silver
chair
cushion
.
``
I
have
no
mirror
here
,
''
she
said
,
again
in
French
,
but
decisively
,
``
but
if
my
eyes
have
changed
it
's
because
I
'm
well
again
.
And
being
well
perhaps
I
've
gone
back
to
my
true
self
--
I
suppose
my
grandfather
was
a
crook
and
I
'm
a
crook
by
heritage
,
so
there
we
are
.
Does
that
satisfy
your
logical
mind
?
''
He
scarcely
seemed
to
know
what
she
was
talking
about
.
``
Where
's
Dick
--
is
he
lunching
with
us
?
''
Seeing
that
his
remark
had
meant
comparatively
little
to
him
she
suddenly
laughed
away
its
effect
.
``
Dick
's
on
a
tour
,
''
she
said
.
``
Rosemary
Hoyt
turned
up
,
and
either
they
're
together
or
she
upset
him
so
much
that
he
wants
to
go
away
and
dream
about
her
.
''
``
You
know
,
you
're
a
little
complicated
after
all
.
''
``
Oh
no
,
''
she
assured
him
hastily
.
``
No
,
I
'm
not
really
--
I
'm
just
a
--
I
'm
just
a
whole
lot
of
different
simple
people
.
''
Marius
brought
out
melon
and
an
ice
pail
,
and
Nicole
,
thinking
irresistibly
about
her
crook
's
eyes
did
not
answer
;
he
gave
one
an
entire
nut
to
crack
,
this
man
,
instead
of
giving
it
in
fragments
to
pick
at
for
meat
.
``
Why
did
n't
they
leave
you
in
your
natural
state
?
''
Tommy
demanded
presently
.
``
You
are
the
most
dramatic
person
I
have
known
.
''
She
had
no
answer
.
``
All
this
taming
of
women
!
''
he
scoffed
.
``
In
any
society
there
are
certain
--
''
She
felt
Dick
's
ghost
prompting
at
her
elbow
but
she
subsided
at
Tommy
's
overtone
:
``
I
've
brutalized
many
men
into
shape
but
I
would
n't
take
a
chance
on
half
the
number
of
women
.
Especially
this
'kind
'
bullying
--
what
good
does
it
do
anybody
?
--
you
or
him
or
anybody
?
''
Her
heart
leaped
and
then
sank
faintly
with
a
sense
of
what
she
owed
Dick
.
``
I
suppose
I
've
got
--
''
``
You
've
got
too
much
money
,
''
he
said
impatiently
.
``
That
's
the
crux
of
the
matter
.
Dick
ca
n't
beat
that
.
''
She
considered
while
the
melons
were
removed
.
``
What
do
you
think
I
ought
to
do
?
''
For
the
first
time
in
ten
years
she
was
under
the
sway
of
a
personality
other
than
her
husband
's
.
Everything
Tommy
said
to
her
became
part
of
her
forever
.
They
drank
the
bottle
of
wine
while
a
faint
wind
rocked
the
pine
needles
and
the
sensuous
heat
of
early
afternoon
made
blinding
freckles
on
the
checkered
luncheon
cloth
.
Tommy
came
over
behind
her
and
laid
his
arms
along
hers
,
clasping
her
hands
.
Their
cheeks
touched
and
then
their
lips
and
she
gasped
half
with
passion
for
him
,
half
with
the
sudden
surprise
of
its
force
.
.
.
.
``
Ca
n't
you
send
the
governess
and
the
children
away
for
the
afternoon
?
''
``
They
have
a
piano
lesson
.
Anyhow
I
do
n't
want
to
stay
here
.
''
``
Kiss
me
again
.
''
A
little
later
,
riding
toward
Nice
,
she
thought
:
So
I
have
white
crook
's
eyes
,
have
I
?
Very
well
then
,
better
a
sane
crook
than
a
mad
puritan
.
His
assertion
seemed
to
absolve
her
from
all
blame
or
responsibility
and
she
had
a
thrill
of
delight
in
thinking
of
herself
in
a
new
way
.
New
vistas
appeared
ahead
,
peopled
with
the
faces
of
many
men
,
none
of
whom
she
need
obey
or
even
love
.
She
drew
in
her
breath
,
hunched
her
shoulders
with
a
wriggle
and
turned
to
Tommy
.
``
Have
we
got
to
go
all
the
way
to
your
hotel
at
Monte
Carlo
?
''
He
brought
the
car
to
a
stop
with
a
squeak
of
tires
.
``
No
!
''
he
answered
.
``
And
,
my
God
,
I
have
never
been
so
happy
as
I
am
this
minute
.
''
They
had
passed
through
Nice
following
the
blue
coast
and
begun
to
mount
to
the
middling-high
Corniche
.
Now
Tommy
turned
sharply
down
to
the
shore
,
ran
out
a
blunt
peninsula
,
and
stopped
in
the
rear
of
a
small
shore
hotel
.
Its
tangibility
frightened
Nicole
for
a
moment
.
At
the
desk
an
American
was
arguing
interminably
with
the
clerk
about
the
rate
of
exchange
.
She
hovered
,
outwardly
tranquil
but
inwardly
miserable
,
as
Tommy
filled
out
the
police
blanks
--
his
real
,
hers
false
.
Their
room
was
a
Mediterranean
room
,
almost
ascetic
,
almost
clean
,
darkened
to
the
glare
of
the
sea
.
Simplest
of
pleasures
--
simplest
of
places
.
Tommy
ordered
two
cognacs
,
and
when
the
door
closed
behind
the
waiter
,
he
sat
in
the
only
chair
,
dark
,
scarred
and
handsome
,
his
eyebrows
arched
and
upcurling
,
a
fighting
Puck
,
an
earnest
Satan
.
Before
they
had
finished
the
brandy
they
suddenly
moved
together
and
met
standing
up
;
then
they
were
sitting
on
the
bed
and
he
kissed
her
hardy
knees
.
Struggling
a
little
still
,
like
a
decapitated
animal
she
forgot
about
Dick
and
her
new
white
eyes
,
forgot
Tommy
himself
and
sank
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
minutes
and
the
moment
.
.
.
.
When
he
got
up
to
open
a
shutter
and
find
out
what
caused
the
increasing
clamor
below
their
windows
,
his
figure
was
darker
and
stronger
than
Dick
's
,
with
high
lights
along
the
rope-twists
of
muscle
.
Momentarily
he
had
forgotten
her
too
--
almost
in
the
second
of
his
flesh
breaking
from
hers
she
had
a
foretaste
that
things
were
going
to
be
different
than
she
had
expected
.
She
felt
the
nameless
fear
which
precedes
all
emotions
,
joyous
or
sorrowful
,
inevitable
as
a
hum
of
thunder
precedes
a
storm
.
Tommy
peered
cautiously
from
the
balcony
and
reported
.
``
All
I
can
see
is
two
women
on
the
balcony
below
this
.
They
're
talking
about
weather
and
tipping
back
and
forth
in
American
rocking-chairs
.
''
``
Making
all
that
noise
?
''
``
The
noise
is
coming
from
somewhere
below
them
.
Listen
.
''
``
Oh
,
way
down
South
in
the
land
of
cotton
Hotels
bum
and
business
rotten
Look
away
--
''
``
It
's
Americans
.
''
Nicole
flung
her
arms
wide
on
the
bed
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
;
the
powder
had
dampened
on
her
to
make
a
milky
surface
.
She
liked
the
bareness
of
the
room
,
the
sound
of
the
single
fly
navigating
overhead
.
Tommy
brought
the
chair
over
to
the
bed
and
swept
the
clothes
off
it
to
sit
down
;
she
liked
the
economy
of
the
weightless
dress
and
espadrilles
that
mingled
with
his
ducks
upon
the
floor
.
He
inspected
the
oblong
white
torso
joined
abruptly
to
the
brown
limbs
and
head
,
and
said
,
laughing
gravely
:
``
You
are
all
new
like
a
baby
.
''
``
With
white
eyes
.
''
``
I
'll
take
care
of
that
.
''
``
It
's
very
hard
taking
care
of
white
eyes
--
especially
the
ones
made
in
Chicago
.
''
``
I
know
all
the
old
Languedoc
peasant
remedies
.
''
``
Kiss
me
,
on
the
lips
,
Tommy
.
''
``
That
's
so
American
,
''
he
said
,
kissing
her
nevertheless
.
``
When
I
was
in
America
last
there
were
girls
who
would
tear
you
apart
with
their
lips
,
tear
themselves
too
,
until
their
faces
were
scarlet
with
the
blood
around
the
lips
all
brought
out
in
a
patch
--
but
nothing
further
.
''
Nicole
leaned
up
on
one
elbow
.
``
I
like
this
room
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
find
it
somewhat
meagre
.
Darling
,
I
'm
glad
you
would
n't
wait
until
we
got
to
Monte
Carlo
.
''
``
Why
only
meagre
?
Why
,
this
is
a
wonderful
room
,
Tommy
--
like
the
bare
tables
in
so
many
Cézannes
and
Picassos
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
He
did
not
try
to
understand
her
.
``
There
's
that
noise
again
.
My
God
,
has
there
been
a
murder
?
''
He
went
to
the
window
and
reported
once
more
:
``
It
seems
to
be
two
American
sailors
fighting
and
a
lot
more
cheering
them
on
.
They
are
from
your
battleship
off
shore
.
''
He
wrapped
a
towel
around
himself
and
went
farther
out
on
the
balcony
.
``
They
have
poules
with
them
.
I
have
heard
about
this
now
--
the
women
follow
them
from
place
to
place
wherever
the
ship
goes
.
But
what
women
!
One
would
think
with
their
pay
they
could
find
better
women
!
Why
the
women
who
followed
Korniloff
!
Why
we
never
looked
at
anything
less
than
a
ballerina
!
''
Nicole
was
glad
he
had
known
so
many
women
,
so
that
the
word
itself
meant
nothing
to
him
;
she
would
be
able
to
hold
him
so
long
as
the
person
in
her
transcended
the
universals
of
her
body
.
``
Hit
him
where
it
hurts
!
''
``
Yah-h-h-h
!
''
``
Hey
,
what
I
tell
you
get
inside
that
right
!
''
``
Come
on
,
Dulschmit
,
you
son
!
''
``
Yaa-Yaa
!
''
``
YA-YEH-YAH
!
''
Tommy
turned
away
.
``
This
place
seems
to
have
outlived
its
usefulness
,
you
agree
?
''
She
agreed
,
but
they
clung
together
for
a
moment
before
dressing
,
and
then
for
a
while
longer
it
seemed
as
good
enough
a
palace
as
any
.
.
.
.
Dressing
at
last
Tommy
exclaimed
:
``
My
God
,
those
two
women
in
the
rocking-chairs
on
the
balcony
below
us
have
n't
moved
.
They
're
trying
to
talk
this
matter
out
of
existence
.
They
're
here
on
an
economical
holiday
,
and
all
the
American
navy
and
all
the
whores
in
Europe
could
n't
spoil
it
.
''
He
came
over
gently
and
surrounded
her
,
pulling
the
shoulder
strap
of
her
slip
into
place
with
his
teeth
;
then
a
sound
split
the
air
outside
:
Cr-ACK
--
BOOM-M-m-m
!
It
was
the
battleship
sounding
a
recall
.
Now
,
down
below
their
window
,
it
was
pandemonium
indeed
--
for
the
boat
was
moving
to
shores
as
yet
unannounced
.
Waiters
called
accounts
and
demanded
settlements
in
impassioned
voices
,
there
were
oaths
and
denials
;
the
tossing
of
bills
too
large
and
change
too
small
;
passouts
were
assisted
to
the
boats
,
and
the
voices
of
the
naval
police
chopped
with
quick
commands
through
all
voices
.
There
were
cries
,
tears
,
shrieks
,
promises
as
the
first
launch
shoved
off
and
the
women
crowded
forward
on
the
wharf
,
screaming
and
waving
.
Tommy
saw
a
girl
rush
out
upon
the
balcony
below
waving
a
napkin
,
and
before
he
could
see
whether
or
not
the
rocking
Englishwomen
gave
in
at
last
and
acknowledged
her
presence
,
there
was
a
knock
at
their
own
door
.
Outside
,
excited
female
voices
made
them
agree
to
unlock
it
,
disclosing
two
girls
,
young
,
thin
and
barbaric
,
unfound
rather
than
lost
,
in
the
hall
.
One
of
them
wept
chokingly
.
``
Kwee
wave
off
your
porch
?
''
implored
the
other
in
passionate
American
.
``
Kwee
please
?
Wave
at
the
boy
friends
?
Kwee
,
please
.
The
other
rooms
is
all
locked
.
''
``
With
pleasure
,
''
Tommy
said
.
The
girls
rushed
out
on
the
balcony
and
presently
their
voices
struck
a
loud
treble
over
the
din
.
``
'By
,
Charlie
!
Charlie
,
look
up
!
''
``
Send
a
wire
gen'al
alivery
Nice
!
''
``
Charlie
!
He
do
n't
see
me
.
''
One
of
the
girls
hoisted
her
skirt
suddenly
,
pulled
and
ripped
at
her
pink
step-ins
and
tore
them
to
a
sizable
flag
;
then
,
screaming
``
Ben
!
Ben
!
''
she
waved
it
wildly
.
As
Tommy
and
Nicole
left
the
room
it
still
fluttered
against
the
blue
sky
.
Oh
,
say
can
you
see
the
tender
color
of
remembered
flesh
?
--
while
at
the
stern
of
the
battleship
arose
in
rivalry
the
Star-Spangled
Banner
.
They
dined
at
the
new
Beach
Casino
at
Monte
Carlo
.
.
.
much
later
they
swam
in
Beaulieu
in
a
roofless
cavern
of
white
moonlight
formed
by
a
circlet
of
pale
boulders
about
a
cup
of
phosphorescent
water
,
facing
Monaco
and
the
blur
of
Mentone
.
She
liked
his
bringing
her
there
to
the
eastward
vision
and
the
novel
tricks
of
wind
and
water
;
it
was
all
as
new
as
they
were
to
each
other
.
Symbolically
she
lay
across
his
saddle-bow
as
surely
as
if
he
had
wolfed
her
away
from
Damascus
and
they
had
come
out
upon
the
Mongolian
plain
.
Moment
by
moment
all
that
Dick
had
taught
her
fell
away
and
she
was
ever
nearer
to
what
she
had
been
in
the
beginning
,
prototype
of
that
obscure
yielding
up
of
swords
that
was
going
on
in
the
world
about
her
.
Tangled
with
love
in
the
moonlight
she
welcomed
the
anarchy
of
her
lover
.
They
awoke
together
finding
the
moon
gone
down
and
the
air
cool
.
She
struggled
up
demanding
the
time
and
Tommy
called
it
roughly
at
three
.
``
I
've
got
to
go
home
then
.
''
``
I
thought
we
'd
sleep
in
Monte
Carlo
.
''
``
No
.
There
's
a
governess
and
the
children
.
I
've
got
to
roll
in
before
daylight
.
''
``
As
you
like
.
''
They
dipped
for
a
second
,
and
when
he
saw
her
shivering
he
rubbed
her
briskly
with
a
towel
.
As
they
got
into
the
car
with
their
heads
still
damp
,
their
skins
fresh
and
glowing
,
they
were
loath
to
start
back
.
It
was
very
bright
where
they
were
and
as
Tommy
kissed
her
she
felt
him
losing
himself
in
the
whiteness
of
her
cheeks
and
her
white
teeth
and
her
cool
brow
and
the
hand
that
touched
his
face
.
Still
attuned
to
Dick
,
she
waited
for
interpretation
or
qualification
;
but
none
was
forthcoming
.
Reassured
sleepily
and
happily
that
none
would
be
,
she
sank
low
in
the
seat
and
drowsed
until
the
sound
of
the
motor
changed
and
she
felt
them
climbing
toward
Villa
Diana
.
At
the
gate
she
kissed
him
an
almost
automatic
good-by
.
The
sound
of
her
feet
on
the
walk
was
changed
,
the
night
noises
of
the
garden
were
suddenly
in
the
past
but
she
was
glad
,
none
the
less
,
to
be
back
.
The
day
had
progressed
at
a
staccato
rate
,
and
in
spite
of
its
satisfactions
she
was
not
habituated
to
such
strain
.
IX
At
four
o'clock
next
afternoon
a
station
taxi
stopped
at
the
gate
and
Dick
got
out
.
Suddenly
off
balance
,
Nicole
ran
from
the
terrace
to
meet
him
,
breathless
with
her
effort
at
self-control
.
``
Where
's
the
car
?
''
she
asked
.
``
I
left
it
in
Arles
.
I
did
n't
feel
like
driving
any
more
.
''
``
I
thought
from
your
note
that
you
'd
be
several
days
.
''
``
I
ran
into
a
mistral
and
some
rain
.
''
``
Did
you
have
fun
?
''
``
Just
as
much
fun
as
anybody
has
running
away
from
things
.
I
drove
Rosemary
as
far
as
Avignon
and
put
her
on
her
train
there
.
''
They
walked
toward
the
terrace
together
,
where
he
deposited
his
bag
.
``
I
did
n't
tell
you
in
the
note
because
I
thought
you
'd
imagine
a
lot
of
things
.
''
``
That
was
very
considerate
of
you
.
''
Nicole
felt
surer
of
herself
now
.
``
I
wanted
to
find
out
if
she
had
anything
to
offer
--
the
only
way
was
to
see
her
alone
.
''
``
Did
she
have
--
anything
to
offer
?
''
``
Rosemary
did
n't
grow
up
,
''
he
answered
.
``
It
's
probably
better
that
way
.
What
have
you
been
doing
?
''
She
felt
her
face
quiver
like
a
rabbit
's
.
``
I
went
dancing
last
night
--
with
Tommy
Barban
.
We
went
--
''
He
winced
,
interrupting
her
.
``
Do
n't
tell
me
about
it
.
It
does
n't
matter
what
you
do
,
only
I
do
n't
want
to
know
anything
definitely
.
''
``
There
is
n't
anything
to
know
.
''
``
All
right
,
all
right
.
''
Then
as
if
he
had
been
away
a
week
:
``
How
are
the
children
?
''
The
phone
rang
in
the
house
.
``
If
it
's
for
me
I
'm
not
home
,
''
said
Dick
turning
away
quickly
.
``
I
've
got
some
things
to
do
over
in
the
work-room
.
''
Nicole
waited
till
he
was
out
of
sight
behind
the
well
;
then
she
went
into
the
house
and
took
up
the
phone
.
``
Nicole
,
comment
vas-tu
?
''
``
Dick
's
home
.
''
He
groaned
.
``
Meet
me
here
in
Cannes
,
''
he
suggested
.
``
I
've
got
to
talk
to
you
.
''
``
I
ca
n't
.
''
``
Tell
me
you
love
me
.
''
Without
speaking
she
nodded
at
the
receiver
;
he
repeated
,
``
Tell
me
you
love
me
.
''
``
Oh
,
I
do
,
''
she
assured
him
.
``
But
there
's
nothing
to
be
done
right
now
.
''
``
Of
course
there
is
,
''
he
said
impatiently
.
``
Dick
sees
it
's
over
between
you
two
--
it
's
obvious
he
has
quit
.
What
does
he
expect
you
to
do
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
'll
have
to
--
''
She
stopped
herself
from
saying
``
--
to
wait
until
I
can
ask
Dick
,
''
and
instead
finished
with
:
``
I
'll
write
and
I
'll
phone
you
to-morrow
.
''
She
wandered
about
the
house
rather
contentedly
,
resting
on
her
achievement
.
She
was
a
mischief
,
and
that
was
a
satisfaction
;
no
longer
was
she
a
huntress
of
corralled
game
.
Yesterday
came
back
to
her
now
in
innumerable
detail
--
detail
that
began
to
overlay
her
memory
of
similar
moments
when
her
love
for
Dick
was
fresh
and
intact
.
She
began
to
slight
that
love
,
so
that
it
seemed
to
have
been
tinged
with
sentimental
habit
from
the
first
.
With
the
opportunistic
memory
of
women
she
scarcely
recalled
how
she
had
felt
when
she
and
Dick
had
possessed
each
other
in
secret
places
around
the
corners
of
the
world
,
during
the
month
before
they
were
married
.
Just
so
had
she
lied
to
Tommy
last
night
,
swearing
to
him
that
never
before
had
she
so
entirely
,
so
completely
,
so
utterly
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
then
remorse
for
this
moment
of
betrayal
,
which
so
cavalierly
belittled
a
decade
of
her
life
,
turned
her
walk
toward
Dick
's
sanctuary
.
Approaching
noiselessly
she
saw
him
behind
his
cottage
,
sitting
in
a
steamer
chair
by
the
cliff
wall
,
and
for
a
moment
she
regarded
him
silently
.
He
was
thinking
,
he
was
living
a
world
completely
his
own
and
in
the
small
motions
of
his
face
,
the
brow
raised
or
lowered
,
the
eyes
narrowed
or
widened
,
the
lips
set
and
reset
,
the
play
of
his
hands
,
she
saw
him
progress
from
phase
to
phase
of
his
own
story
spinning
out
inside
him
,
his
own
,
not
hers
.
Once
he
clenched
his
fists
and
leaned
forward
,
once
it
brought
into
his
face
an
expression
of
torment
and
despair
--
when
this
passed
its
stamp
lingered
in
his
eyes
.
For
almost
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
sorry
for
him
--
it
is
hard
for
those
who
have
once
been
mentally
afflicted
to
be
sorry
for
those
who
are
well
,
and
though
Nicole
often
paid
lip
service
to
the
fact
that
he
had
led
her
back
to
the
world
she
had
forfeited
,
she
had
thought
of
him
really
as
an
inexhaustible
energy
,
incapable
of
fatigue
--
she
forgot
the
troubles
she
caused
him
at
the
moment
when
she
forgot
the
troubles
of
her
own
that
had
prompted
her
.
That
he
no
longer
controlled
her
--
did
he
know
that
?
Had
he
willed
it
all
?
--
she
felt
as
sorry
for
him
as
she
had
sometimes
felt
for
Abe
North
and
his
ignoble
destiny
,
sorry
as
for
the
helplessness
of
infants
and
the
old
.
She
went
up
putting
her
arm
around
his
shoulder
and
touching
their
heads
together
said
:
``
Do
n't
be
sad
.
''
He
looked
at
her
coldly
.
``
Do
n't
touch
me
!
''
he
said
.
Confused
she
moved
a
few
feet
away
.
``
Excuse
me
,
''
he
continued
abstractedly
.
``
I
was
just
thinking
what
I
thought
of
you
--
''
``
Why
not
add
the
new
classification
to
your
book
?
''
``
I
have
thought
of
it
--
'Furthermore
and
beyond
the
psychoses
and
the
neuroses
--
'
''
``
I
did
n't
come
over
here
to
be
disagreeable
.
''
``
Then
why
did
you
come
,
Nicole
?
I
ca
n't
do
anything
for
you
any
more
.
I
'm
trying
to
save
myself
.
''
``
From
my
contamination
?
''
``
Profession
throws
me
in
contact
with
questionable
company
sometimes
.
''
She
wept
with
anger
at
the
abuse
.
``
You
're
a
coward
!
You
've
made
a
failure
of
your
life
,
and
you
want
to
blame
it
on
me
.
''
While
he
did
not
answer
she
began
to
feel
the
old
hypnotism
of
his
intelligence
,
sometimes
exercised
without
power
but
always
with
substrata
of
truth
under
truth
which
she
could
not
break
or
even
crack
.
Again
she
struggled
with
it
,
fighting
him
with
her
small
,
fine
eyes
,
with
the
plush
arrogance
of
a
top
dog
,
with
her
nascent
transference
to
another
man
,
with
the
accumulated
resentment
of
years
;
she
fought
him
with
her
money
and
her
faith
that
her
sister
disliked
him
and
was
behind
her
now
;
with
the
thought
of
the
new
enemies
he
was
making
with
his
bitterness
,
with
her
quick
guile
against
his
wine-ing
and
dine-ing
slowness
,
her
health
and
beauty
against
his
physical
deterioration
,
her
unscrupulousness
against
his
moralities
--
for
this
inner
battle
she
used
even
her
weaknesses
--
fighting
bravely
and
courageously
with
the
old
cans
and
crockery
and
bottles
,
empty
receptacles
of
her
expiated
sins
,
outrages
,
mistakes
.
And
suddenly
,
in
the
space
of
two
minutes
she
achieved
her
victory
and
justified
herself
to
herself
without
lie
or
subterfuge
,
cut
the
cord
forever
.
Then
she
walked
,
weak
in
the
legs
,
and
sobbing
coolly
,
toward
the
household
that
was
hers
at
last
.
Dick
waited
until
she
was
out
of
sight
.
Then
he
leaned
his
head
forward
on
the
parapet
.
The
case
was
finished
.
Doctor
Diver
was
at
liberty
.
X
At
two
o'clock
that
night
the
phone
woke
Nicole
and
she
heard
Dick
answer
it
from
what
they
called
the
restless
bed
,
in
the
next
room
.
``
Oui
,
oui
.
.
.
mais
à
qui
est-ce-que
je
parle
?
.
.
.
Oui
.
.
.
''
His
voice
woke
up
with
surprise
.
``
But
can
I
speak
to
one
of
the
ladies
,
Sir
the
Officer
?
They
are
both
ladies
of
the
very
highest
prominence
,
ladies
of
connections
that
might
cause
political
complications
of
the
most
serious
.
.
.
.
It
is
a
fact
,
I
swear
to
you
.
.
.
.
Very
well
,
you
will
see
.
''
He
got
up
and
,
as
he
absorbed
the
situation
,
his
self-knowledge
assured
him
that
he
would
undertake
to
deal
with
it
--
the
old
fatal
pleasingness
,
the
old
forceful
charm
,
swept
back
with
its
cry
of
``
Use
me
!
''
He
would
have
to
go
fix
this
thing
that
he
did
n't
care
a
damn
about
,
because
it
had
early
become
a
habit
to
be
loved
,
perhaps
from
the
moment
when
he
had
realized
that
he
was
the
last
hope
of
a
decaying
clan
.
On
an
almost
parallel
occasion
,
back
in
Dohmler
's
clinic
on
the
Zürichsee
,
realizing
this
power
,
he
had
made
his
choice
,
chosen
Ophelia
,
chosen
the
sweet
poison
and
drunk
it
.
Wanting
above
all
to
be
brave
and
kind
,
he
had
wanted
,
even
more
than
that
,
to
be
loved
.
So
it
had
been
.
So
it
would
ever
be
,
he
saw
,
simultaneously
with
the
slow
archaic
tinkle
from
the
phone
box
as
he
rang
off
.
There
was
a
long
pause
.
Nicole
called
,
``
What
is
it
?
Who
is
it
?
''
Dick
had
begun
to
dress
even
as
he
hung
up
the
phone
.
``
It
's
the
poste
de
police
in
Antibes
--
they
're
holding
Mary
North
and
that
Sibley-Biers
.
It
's
something
serious
--
the
agent
would
n't
tell
me
;
he
kept
saying
'pas
de
mortes
--
pas
d'automobiles
'
but
he
implied
it
was
just
about
everything
else
.
''
``
Why
on
earth
did
they
call
on
you
?
It
sounds
very
peculiar
to
me
.
''
``
They
've
got
to
get
out
on
bail
to
save
their
faces
;
and
only
some
property
owner
in
the
Alpes
Maritimes
can
give
bail
.
''
``
They
had
their
nerve
.
''
``
I
do
n't
mind
.
However
I
'll
pick
up
Gausse
at
the
hotel
--
''
Nicole
stayed
awake
after
he
had
departed
wondering
what
offense
they
could
have
committed
;
then
she
slept
.
A
little
after
three
when
Dick
came
in
she
sat
up
stark
awake
saying
,
``
What
?
''
as
if
to
a
character
in
her
dream
.
``
It
was
an
extraordinary
story
--
''
Dick
said
.
He
sat
on
the
foot
of
her
bed
,
telling
her
how
he
had
roused
old
Gausse
from
an
Alsatian
coma
,
told
him
to
clean
out
his
cash
drawer
,
and
driven
with
him
to
the
police
station
.
``
I
do
n't
like
to
do
something
for
that
Anglaise
,
''
Gausse
grumbled
.
Mary
North
and
Lady
Caroline
,
dressed
in
the
costume
of
French
sailors
,
lounged
on
a
bench
outside
the
two
dingy
cells
.
The
latter
had
the
outraged
air
of
a
Briton
who
momentarily
expected
the
Mediterranean
fleet
to
steam
up
to
her
assistance
.
Mary
Minghetti
was
in
a
condition
of
panic
and
collapse
--
she
literally
flung
herself
at
Dick
's
stomach
as
though
that
were
the
point
of
greatest
association
,
imploring
him
to
do
something
.
Meanwhile
the
chief
of
police
explained
the
matter
to
Gausse
who
listened
to
each
word
with
reluctance
,
divided
between
being
properly
appreciative
of
the
officer
's
narrative
gift
and
showing
that
,
as
the
perfect
servant
,
the
story
had
no
shocking
effect
on
him
.
``
It
was
merely
a
lark
,
''
said
Lady
Caroline
with
scorn
.
``
We
were
pretending
to
be
sailors
on
leave
,
and
we
picked
up
two
silly
girls
.
They
got
the
wind
up
and
made
a
rotten
scene
in
a
lodging
house
.
''
Dick
nodded
gravely
,
looking
at
the
stone
floor
,
like
a
priest
in
the
confessional
--
he
was
torn
between
a
tendency
to
ironic
laughter
and
another
tendency
to
order
fifty
stripes
of
the
cat
and
a
fortnight
of
bread
and
water
.
The
lack
,
in
Lady
Caroline
's
face
,
of
any
sense
of
evil
,
except
the
evil
wrought
by
cowardly
Provençal
girls
and
stupid
police
,
confounded
him
;
yet
he
had
long
concluded
that
certain
classes
of
English
people
lived
upon
a
concentrated
essence
of
the
anti-social
that
,
in
comparison
,
reduced
the
gorgings
of
New
York
to
something
like
a
child
contracting
indigestion
from
ice
cream
.
``
I
've
got
to
get
out
before
Hosain
hears
about
this
,
''
Mary
pleaded
.
``
Dick
,
you
can
always
arrange
things
--
you
always
could
.
Tell
'em
we
'll
go
right
home
,
tell
'em
we
'll
pay
anything
.
''
``
I
shall
not
,
''
said
Lady
Caroline
disdainfully
.
``
Not
a
shilling
.
But
I
shall
jolly
well
find
out
what
the
Consulate
in
Cannes
has
to
say
about
this
.
''
``
No
,
no
!
''
insisted
Mary
.
``
We
've
got
to
get
out
to-night
.
''
``
I
'll
see
what
I
can
do
,
''
said
Dick
,
and
added
,
``
but
money
will
certainly
have
to
change
hands
.
''
Looking
at
them
as
though
they
were
the
innocents
that
he
knew
they
were
not
,
he
shook
his
head
:
``
Of
all
the
crazy
stunts
!
''
Lady
Caroline
smiled
complacently
.
``
You
're
an
insanity
doctor
,
are
n't
you
?
You
ought
to
be
able
to
help
us
--
and
Gausse
has
got
to
!
''
At
this
point
Dick
went
aside
with
Gausse
and
talked
over
the
old
man
's
findings
.
The
affair
was
more
serious
than
had
been
indicated
--
one
of
the
girls
whom
they
had
picked
up
was
of
a
respectable
family
.
The
family
were
furious
,
or
pretended
to
be
;
a
settlement
would
have
to
be
made
with
them
.
The
other
one
,
a
girl
of
the
port
,
could
be
more
easily
dealt
with
.
There
were
French
statutes
that
would
make
conviction
punishable
by
imprisonment
or
,
at
the
very
least
,
public
expulsion
from
the
country
.
In
addition
to
the
difficulties
,
there
was
a
growing
difference
in
tolerance
between
such
townspeople
as
benefited
by
the
foreign
colony
and
the
ones
who
were
annoyed
by
the
consequent
rise
of
prices
.
Gausse
,
having
summarized
the
situation
,
turned
it
over
to
Dick
.
Dick
called
the
chief
of
police
into
conference
.
``
Now
you
know
that
the
French
government
wants
to
encourage
American
touring
--
so
much
so
that
in
Paris
this
summer
there
's
an
order
that
Americans
ca
n't
be
arrested
except
for
the
most
serious
offenses
.
''
``
This
is
serious
enough
,
my
God
.
''
``
But
look
now
--
you
have
their
Cartes
d'Identité
?
''
``
They
had
none
.
They
had
nothing
--
two
hundred
francs
and
some
rings
.
Not
even
shoe-laces
that
they
could
have
hung
themselves
with
!
''
Relieved
that
there
had
been
no
Cartes
d'Identité
Dick
continued
.
``
The
Italian
Countess
is
still
an
American
citizen
.
She
is
the
grand-daughter
--
''
he
told
a
string
of
lies
slowly
and
portentously
,
``
of
John
D.
Rockefeller
Mellon
.
You
have
heard
of
him
?
''
``
Yes
,
oh
heavens
,
yes
.
You
mistake
me
for
a
nobody
?
''
``
In
addition
she
is
the
niece
of
Lord
Henry
Ford
and
so
connected
with
the
Renault
and
Citroën
companies
--
''
He
thought
he
had
better
stop
here
.
However
the
sincerity
of
his
voice
had
begun
to
affect
the
officer
,
so
he
continued
:
``
To
arrest
her
is
just
as
if
you
arrested
a
great
royalty
of
England
.
It
might
mean
--
War
!
''
``
But
how
about
the
Englishwoman
?
''
``
I
'm
coming
to
that
.
She
is
affianced
to
the
brother
of
the
Prince
of
Wales
--
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
.
''
``
She
will
be
an
exquisite
bride
for
him
.
''
``
Now
we
are
prepared
to
give
--
''
Dick
calculated
quickly
,
``
one
thousand
francs
to
each
of
the
girls
--
and
an
additional
thousand
to
the
father
of
the
'serious
'
one
.
Also
two
thousand
in
addition
,
for
you
to
distribute
as
you
think
best
--
''
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
``
--
among
the
men
who
made
the
arrest
,
the
lodging-house
keeper
and
so
forth
.
I
shall
hand
you
the
five
thousand
and
expect
you
to
do
the
negotiating
immediately
.
Then
they
can
be
released
on
bail
on
some
charge
like
disturbing
the
peace
,
and
whatever
fine
there
is
will
be
paid
before
the
magistrate
tomorrow
--
by
messenger
.
''
Before
the
officer
spoke
Dick
saw
by
his
expression
that
it
would
be
all
right
.
The
man
said
hesitantly
,
``
I
have
made
no
entry
because
they
have
no
Cartes
d'Identité
.
I
must
see
--
give
me
the
money
.
''
An
hour
later
Dick
and
M.
Gausse
dropped
the
women
by
the
Majestic
Hotel
,
where
Lady
Caroline
's
chauffeur
slept
in
her
landaulet
.
``
Remember
,
''
said
Dick
,
``
you
owe
Monsieur
Gausse
a
hundred
dollars
a
piece
.
''
``
All
right
,
''
Mary
agreed
,
``
I
'll
give
him
a
check
to-morrow
--
and
something
more
.
''
``
Not
I
!
''
Startled
,
they
all
turned
to
Lady
Caroline
,
who
,
now
entirely
recovered
,
was
swollen
with
righteousness
.
``
The
whole
thing
was
an
outrage
.
By
no
means
did
I
authorize
you
to
give
a
hundred
dollars
to
those
people
.
''
Little
Gausse
stood
beside
the
car
,
his
eyes
blazing
suddenly
.
``
You
wo
n't
pay
me
?
''
``
Of
course
she
will
,
''
said
Dick
.
Suddenly
the
abuse
that
Gausse
had
once
endured
as
a
bus
boy
in
London
flamed
up
and
he
walked
through
the
moonlight
up
to
Lady
Caroline
.
He
whipped
a
string
of
condemnatory
words
about
her
,
and
as
she
turned
away
with
a
frozen
laugh
,
he
took
a
step
after
her
and
swiftly
planted
his
little
foot
in
the
most
celebrated
of
targets
.
Lady
Caroline
,
taken
by
surprise
,
flung
up
her
hands
like
a
person
shot
as
her
sailor-clad
form
sprawled
forward
on
the
sidewalk
.
Dick
's
voice
cut
across
her
raging
:
``
Mary
,
you
quiet
her
down
!
or
you
'll
both
be
in
leg-irons
in
ten
minutes
!
''
On
the
way
back
to
the
hotel
old
Gausse
said
not
a
word
,
until
they
passed
the
Juan-les-Pins
Casino
,
still
sobbing
and
coughing
with
jazz
;
then
he
sighed
forth
:
``
I
have
never
seen
women
like
this
sort
of
women
.
I
have
known
many
of
the
great
courtesans
of
the
world
,
and
for
them
I
have
much
respect
often
,
but
women
like
these
women
I
have
never
seen
before
.
''
XI
Dick
and
Nicole
were
accustomed
to
go
together
to
the
barber
,
and
have
haircuts
and
shampoos
in
adjoining
rooms
.
From
Dick
's
side
Nicole
could
hear
the
snip
of
shears
,
the
count
of
changes
,
the
Voilàs
and
Pardons
.
The
day
after
his
return
they
went
down
to
be
shorn
and
washed
in
the
perfumed
breeze
of
the
fans
.
In
front
of
the
Carleton
Hotel
,
its
windows
as
stubbornly
blank
to
the
summer
as
so
many
cellar
doors
,
a
car
passed
them
and
Tommy
Barban
was
in
it
.
Nicole
's
momentary
glimpse
of
his
expression
,
taciturn
and
thoughtful
and
,
in
the
second
of
seeing
her
,
wide-eyed
and
alert
,
disturbed
her
.
She
wanted
to
be
going
where
he
was
going
.
The
hour
with
the
hair-dresser
seemed
one
of
the
wasteful
intervals
that
composed
her
life
,
another
little
prison
.
The
coiffeuse
in
her
white
uniform
,
faintly
sweating
lip-rouge
and
cologne
reminded
her
of
many
nurses
.
In
the
next
room
Dick
dozed
under
an
apron
and
a
lather
of
soap
.
The
mirror
in
front
of
Nicole
reflected
the
passage
between
the
men
's
side
and
the
women
's
,
and
Nicole
started
up
at
the
sight
of
Tommy
entering
and
wheeling
sharply
into
the
men
's
shop
.
She
knew
with
a
flush
of
joy
that
there
was
going
to
be
some
sort
of
showdown
.
She
heard
fragments
of
its
beginning
.
``
Hello
,
I
want
to
see
you
.
''
``
.
.
.
serious
.
''
``
.
.
.
serious
.
''
``
.
.
.
perfectly
agreeable
.
''
In
a
minute
Dick
came
into
Nicole
's
booth
,
his
expression
emerging
annoyed
from
behind
the
towel
of
his
hastily
rinsed
face
.
``
Your
friend
has
worked
himself
up
into
a
state
.
He
wants
to
see
us
together
,
so
I
agreed
to
have
it
over
with
.
Come
along
!
''
``
But
my
hair
--
it
's
half
cut
.
''
``
Nevermind
--
come
along
!
''
Resentfully
she
had
the
staring
coiffeuse
remove
the
towels
.
Feeling
messy
and
unadorned
she
followed
Dick
from
the
hotel
.
Outside
Tommy
bent
over
her
hand
.
``
We
'll
go
to
the
Café
des
Alliées
,
''
said
Dick
.
``
Wherever
we
can
be
alone
,
''
Tommy
agreed
.
Under
the
arching
trees
,
central
in
summer
,
Dick
asked
:
``
Will
you
take
anything
,
Nicole
?
''
``
A
citron
pressé
.
''
``
For
me
a
demi
,
''
said
Tommy
.
``
The
Blackenwite
with
siphon
,
''
said
Dick
.
``
Il
n'y
a
plus
de
Blackenwite
.
Nous
n'avons
que
le
Johnny
Walkair
.
''
``
Ca
va.
''
``
She
's
--
not
--
wired
for
sound
but
on
the
quiet
you
ought
to
try
it
--
''
``
Your
wife
does
not
love
you
,
''
said
Tommy
suddenly
.
``
She
loves
me
.
''
The
two
men
regarded
each
other
with
a
curious
impotence
of
expression
.
There
can
be
little
communication
between
men
in
that
position
,
for
their
relation
is
indirect
,
and
consists
of
how
much
each
of
them
has
possessed
or
will
possess
of
the
woman
in
question
,
so
that
their
emotions
pass
through
her
divided
self
as
through
a
bad
telephone
connection
.
``
Wait
a
minute
,
''
Dick
said
.
``
Donnez
moi
du
gin
et
du
siphon
.
''
``
Bien
,
Monsieur
.
''
``
All
right
,
go
on
,
Tommy
.
''
``
It
's
very
plain
to
me
that
your
marriage
to
Nicole
has
run
its
course
.
She
is
through
.
I
've
waited
five
years
for
that
to
be
so
.
''
``
What
does
Nicole
say
?
''
They
both
looked
at
her
.
``
I
've
gotten
very
fond
of
Tommy
,
Dick
.
''
He
nodded
.
``
You
do
n't
care
for
me
any
more
,
''
she
continued
.
``
It
's
all
just
habit
.
Things
were
never
the
same
after
Rosemary
.
''
Unattracted
to
this
angle
,
Tommy
broke
in
sharply
with
:
``
You
do
n't
understand
Nicole
.
You
treat
her
always
like
a
patient
because
she
was
once
sick
.
''
They
were
suddenly
interrupted
by
an
insistent
American
,
of
sinister
aspect
,
vending
copies
of
The
Herald
and
of
The
Times
fresh
from
New
York
.
``
Got
everything
here
,
Buddies
,
''
he
announced
.
``
Been
here
long
?
''
``
Cessez
cela
!
Allez
Ouste
!
''
Tommy
cried
and
then
to
Dick
,
``
Now
no
woman
would
stand
such
--
''
``
Buddies
,
''
interrupted
the
American
again
.
``
You
think
I
'm
wasting
my
time
--
but
lots
of
others
do
n't
.
''
He
brought
a
gray
clipping
from
his
purse
--
and
Dick
recognized
it
as
he
saw
it
.
It
cartooned
millions
of
Americans
pouring
from
liners
with
bags
of
gold
.
``
You
think
I
'm
not
going
to
get
part
of
that
?
Well
,
I
am
.
I
'm
just
over
from
Nice
for
the
Tour
de
France
.
''
As
Tommy
got
him
off
with
a
fierce
``
allez-vous-en
,
''
Dick
identified
him
as
the
man
who
had
once
hailed
him
in
the
Rue
de
Saints
Anges
,
five
years
before
.
``
When
does
the
Tour
de
France
get
here
?
''
he
called
after
him
.
``
Any
minute
now
,
Buddy
.
''
He
departed
at
last
with
a
cheery
wave
and
Tommy
returned
to
Dick
.
``
Elle
doit
avoir
plus
avec
moi
qu'avec
vous
.
''
``
Speak
English
!
What
do
you
mean
'doit
avoir
'
?
''
``
'Doit
avoir
?
'
Would
have
more
happiness
with
me
.
''
``
You
'd
be
new
to
each
other
.
But
Nicole
and
I
have
had
much
happiness
together
,
Tommy
.
''
``
L'amour
de
famille
,
''
Tommy
said
,
scoffing
.
``
If
you
and
Nicole
married
wo
n't
that
be
'l'amour
de
famille
'
?
''
The
increasing
commotion
made
him
break
off
;
presently
it
came
to
a
serpentine
head
on
the
promenade
and
a
group
,
presently
a
crowd
,
of
people
sprung
from
hidden
siestas
,
lined
the
curbstone
.
Boys
sprinted
past
on
bicycles
,
automobiles
jammed
with
elaborate
betasselled
sportsmen
slid
up
the
street
,
high
horns
tooted
to
announce
the
approach
of
the
race
,
and
unsuspected
cooks
in
undershirts
appeared
at
restaurant
doors
as
around
a
bend
a
procession
came
into
sight
.
First
was
a
lone
cyclist
in
a
red
jersey
,
toiling
intent
and
confident
out
of
the
westering
sun
,
passing
to
the
melody
of
a
high
chattering
cheer
.
Then
three
together
in
a
harlequinade
of
faded
color
,
legs
caked
yellow
with
dust
and
sweat
,
faces
expressionless
,
eyes
heavy
and
endlessly
tired
.
Tommy
faced
Dick
,
saying
:
``
I
think
Nicole
wants
a
divorce
--
I
suppose
you
'll
make
no
obstacles
?
''
A
troupe
of
fifty
more
swarmed
after
the
first
bicycle
racers
,
strung
out
over
two
hundred
yards
;
a
few
were
smiling
and
self-conscious
,
a
few
obviously
exhausted
,
most
of
them
indifferent
and
weary
.
A
retinue
of
small
boys
passed
,
a
few
defiant
stragglers
,
a
light
truck
carried
the
dupes
of
accident
and
defeat
.
They
were
back
at
the
table
.
Nicole
wanted
Dick
to
take
the
initiative
,
but
he
seemed
content
to
sit
with
his
face
half-shaved
matching
her
hair
half-washed
.
``
Is
n't
it
true
you
're
not
happy
with
me
any
more
?
''
Nicole
continued
.
``
Without
me
you
could
get
to
your
work
again
--
you
could
work
better
if
you
did
n't
worry
about
me
.
''
Tommy
moved
impatiently
.
``
That
is
so
useless
.
Nicole
and
I
love
each
other
,
that
's
all
there
is
to
it
.
''
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
the
Doctor
,
``
since
it
's
all
settled
,
suppose
we
go
back
to
the
barber
shop
.
''
Tommy
wanted
a
row
:
``
There
are
several
points
--
''
``
Nicole
and
I
will
talk
things
over
,
''
said
Dick
equitably
.
``
Do
n't
worry
--
I
agree
in
principal
,
and
Nicole
and
I
understand
each
other
.
There
's
less
chance
of
unpleasantness
if
we
avoid
a
three-cornered
discussion
.
''
Unwillingly
acknowledging
Dick
's
logic
,
Tommy
was
moved
by
an
irresistible
racial
tendency
to
chisel
for
an
advantage
.
``
Let
it
be
understood
that
from
this
moment
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
stand
in
the
position
of
Nicole
's
protector
until
details
can
be
arranged
.
And
I
shall
hold
you
strictly
accountable
for
any
abuse
of
the
fact
that
you
continue
to
inhabit
the
same
house
.
''
``
I
never
did
go
in
for
making
love
to
dry
loins
,
''
said
Dick
.
He
nodded
,
and
walked
off
toward
the
hotel
with
Nicole
's
whitest
eyes
following
him
.
``
He
was
fair
enough
,
''
Tommy
conceded
.
``
Darling
,
will
we
be
together
to-night
?
''
``
I
suppose
so
.
''
So
it
had
happened
--
and
with
a
minimum
of
drama
;
Nicole
felt
outguessed
,
realizing
that
from
the
episode
of
the
camphor-rub
,
Dick
had
anticipated
everything
.
But
also
she
felt
happy
and
excited
,
and
the
odd
little
wish
that
she
could
tell
Dick
all
about
it
faded
quickly
.
But
her
eyes
followed
his
figure
until
it
became
a
dot
and
mingled
with
the
other
dots
in
the
summer
crowd
.
XII
The
day
before
Doctor
Diver
left
the
Riviera
he
spent
all
his
time
with
his
children
.
He
was
not
young
any
more
with
a
lot
of
nice
thoughts
and
dreams
to
have
about
himself
,
so
he
wanted
to
remember
them
well
.
The
children
had
been
told
that
this
winter
they
would
be
with
their
aunt
in
London
and
that
soon
they
were
going
to
come
and
see
him
in
America
.
Fräulein
was
not
to
be
discharged
without
his
consent
.
He
was
glad
he
had
given
so
much
to
the
little
girl
--
about
the
boy
he
was
more
uncertain
--
always
he
had
been
uneasy
about
what
he
had
to
give
to
the
ever-climbing
,
ever-clinging
,
breast-searching
young
.
But
,
when
he
said
good-by
to
them
,
he
wanted
to
lift
their
beautiful
heads
off
their
necks
and
hold
them
close
for
hours
.
He
embraced
the
old
gardener
who
had
made
the
first
garden
at
Villa
Diana
six
years
ago
;
he
kissed
the
Provençal
girl
who
helped
with
the
children
.
She
had
been
with
them
for
almost
a
decade
and
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
cried
until
Dick
jerked
her
to
her
feet
and
gave
her
three
hundred
francs
.
Nicole
was
sleeping
late
,
as
had
been
agreed
upon
--
he
left
a
note
for
her
,
and
one
for
Baby
Warren
who
was
just
back
from
Sardinia
and
staying
at
the
house
.
Dick
took
a
big
drink
from
a
bottle
of
brandy
three
feet
high
,
holding
ten
quarts
,
that
some
one
had
presented
them
with
.
Then
he
decided
to
leave
his
bags
by
the
station
in
Cannes
and
take
a
last
look
at
Gausse
's
Beach
.
The
beach
was
peopled
with
only
an
advance
guard
of
children
when
Nicole
and
her
sister
arrived
that
morning
.
A
white
sun
,
chivied
of
outline
by
a
white
sky
,
boomed
over
a
windless
day
.
Waiters
were
putting
extra
ice
into
the
bar
;
an
American
photographer
from
the
A.
and
P.
worked
with
his
equipment
in
a
precarious
shade
and
looked
up
quickly
at
every
footfall
descending
the
stone
steps
.
At
the
hotel
his
prospective
subjects
slept
late
in
darkened
rooms
upon
their
recent
opiate
of
dawn
.
When
Nicole
started
out
on
the
beach
she
saw
Dick
,
not
dressed
for
swimming
,
sitting
on
a
rock
above
.
She
shrank
back
in
the
shadow
of
her
dressing-tent
.
In
a
minute
Baby
joined
her
,
saying
:
``
Dick
's
still
there
.
''
``
I
saw
him
.
''
``
I
think
he
might
have
the
delicacy
to
go
.
''
``
This
is
his
place
--
in
a
way
,
he
discovered
it
.
Old
Gausse
always
says
he
owes
everything
to
Dick
.
''
Baby
looked
calmly
at
her
sister
.
``
We
should
have
let
him
confine
himself
to
his
bicycle
excursions
,
''
she
remarked
.
``
When
people
are
taken
out
of
their
depths
they
lose
their
heads
,
no
matter
how
charming
a
bluff
they
put
up
.
''
``
Dick
was
a
good
husband
to
me
for
six
years
,
''
Nicole
said
.
``
All
that
time
I
never
suffered
a
minute
's
pain
because
of
him
,
and
he
always
did
his
best
never
to
let
anything
hurt
me
.
''
Baby
's
lower
jaw
projected
slightly
as
she
said
:
``
That
's
what
he
was
educated
for
.
''
The
sisters
sat
in
silence
;
Nicole
wondering
in
a
tired
way
about
things
;
Baby
considering
whether
or
not
to
marry
the
latest
candidate
for
her
hand
and
money
,
an
authenticated
Hapsburg
.
She
was
not
quite
thinking
about
it
.
Her
affairs
had
long
shared
such
a
sameness
,
that
,
as
she
dried
out
,
they
were
more
important
for
their
conversational
value
than
for
themselves
.
Her
emotions
had
their
truest
existence
in
the
telling
of
them
.
``
Is
he
gone
?
''
Nicole
asked
after
a
while
.
``
I
think
his
train
leaves
at
noon
.
''
Baby
looked
.
``
No
.
He
's
moved
up
higher
on
the
terrace
and
he
's
talking
to
some
women
.
Anyhow
there
are
so
many
people
now
that
he
does
n't
have
to
see
us
.
''
He
had
seen
them
though
,
as
they
left
their
pavilion
,
and
he
followed
them
with
his
eyes
until
they
disappeared
again
.
He
sat
with
Mary
Minghetti
,
drinking
anisette
.
``
You
were
like
you
used
to
be
the
night
you
helped
us
,
''
she
was
saying
,
``
except
at
the
end
,
when
you
were
horrid
about
Caroline
.
Why
are
n't
you
nice
like
that
always
?
You
can
be
.
''
It
seemed
fantastic
to
Dick
to
be
in
a
position
where
Mary
North
could
tell
him
about
things
.
``
Your
friends
still
like
you
,
Dick
.
But
you
say
awful
things
to
people
when
you
've
been
drinking
.
I
've
spent
most
of
my
time
defending
you
this
summer
.
''
``
That
remark
is
one
of
Doctor
Eliot
's
classics
.
''
``
It
's
true
.
Nobody
cares
whether
you
drink
or
not
--
''
She
hesitated
,
``
even
when
Abe
drank
hardest
,
he
never
offended
people
like
you
do
.
''
``
You
're
all
so
dull
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
we
're
all
there
is
!
''
cried
Mary
.
``
If
you
do
n't
like
nice
people
,
try
the
ones
who
are
n't
nice
,
and
see
how
you
like
that
!
All
people
want
is
to
have
a
good
time
and
if
you
make
them
unhappy
you
cut
yourself
off
from
nourishment
.
''
``
Have
I
been
nourished
?
''
he
asked
.
Mary
was
having
a
good
time
,
though
she
did
not
know
it
,
as
she
had
sat
down
with
him
only
out
of
fear
.
Again
she
refused
a
drink
and
said
:
``
Self-indulgence
is
back
of
it
.
Of
course
,
after
Abe
you
can
imagine
how
I
feel
about
it
--
since
I
watched
the
progress
of
a
good
man
toward
alcoholism
--
''
Down
the
steps
tripped
Lady
Caroline
Sibly-Biers
with
blithe
theatricality
.
Dick
felt
fine
--
he
was
already
well
in
advance
of
the
day
;
arrived
at
where
a
man
should
be
at
the
end
of
a
good
dinner
,
yet
he
showed
only
a
fine
,
considered
,
restrained
interest
in
Mary
.
His
eyes
,
for
the
moment
clear
as
a
child
's
,
asked
her
sympathy
and
stealing
over
him
he
felt
the
old
necessity
of
convincing
her
that
he
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
and
she
was
the
last
woman
.
.
.
.
Then
he
would
not
have
to
look
at
those
two
other
figures
,
a
man
and
a
woman
,
black
and
white
and
metallic
against
the
sky
.
.
.
.
``
You
once
liked
me
,
did
n't
you
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Liked
you
--
I
loved
you
.
Everybody
loved
you
.
You
could
've
had
anybody
you
wanted
for
the
asking
--
''
``
There
has
always
been
something
between
you
and
me
.
''
She
bit
eagerly
.
``
Has
there
,
Dick
?
''
``
Always
--
I
knew
your
troubles
and
how
brave
you
were
about
them
.
''
But
the
old
interior
laughter
had
begun
inside
him
and
he
knew
he
could
n't
keep
it
up
much
longer
.
``
I
always
thought
you
knew
a
lot
,
''
Mary
said
enthusiastically
.
``
More
about
me
than
any
one
has
ever
known
.
Perhaps
that
's
why
I
was
so
afraid
of
you
when
we
did
n't
get
along
so
well
.
''
His
glance
fell
soft
and
kind
upon
hers
,
suggesting
an
emotion
underneath
;
their
glances
married
suddenly
,
bedded
,
strained
together
.
Then
,
as
the
laughter
inside
of
him
became
so
loud
that
it
seemed
as
if
Mary
must
hear
it
,
Dick
switched
off
the
light
and
they
were
back
in
the
Riviera
sun
.
``
I
must
go
,
''
he
said
.
As
he
stood
up
he
swayed
a
little
;
he
did
not
feel
well
any
more
--
his
blood
raced
slow
.
He
raised
his
right
hand
and
with
a
papal
cross
he
blessed
the
beach
from
the
high
terrace
.
Faces
turned
upward
from
several
umbrellas
.
``
I
'm
going
to
him
.
''
Nicole
got
to
her
knees
.
``
No
,
you
're
not
,
''
said
Tommy
,
pulling
her
down
firmly
.
``
Let
well
enough
alone
.
''
XIII
Nicole
kept
in
touch
with
Dick
after
her
new
marriage
;
there
were
letters
on
business
matters
,
and
about
the
children
.
When
she
said
,
as
she
often
did
,
``
I
loved
Dick
and
I
'll
never
forget
him
,
''
Tommy
answered
,
``
Of
course
not
--
why
should
you
?
''
Dick
opened
an
office
in
Buffalo
,
but
evidently
without
success
.
Nicole
did
not
find
what
the
trouble
was
,
but
she
heard
a
few
months
later
that
he
was
in
a
little
town
named
Batavia
,
N.Y.
,
practising
general
medicine
,
and
later
that
he
was
in
Lockport
,
doing
the
same
thing
.
By
accident
she
heard
more
about
his
life
there
than
anywhere
:
that
he
bicycled
a
lot
,
was
much
admired
by
the
ladies
,
and
always
had
a
big
stack
of
papers
on
his
desk
that
were
known
to
be
an
important
treatise
on
some
medical
subject
,
almost
in
process
of
completion
.
He
was
considered
to
have
fine
manners
and
once
made
a
good
speech
at
a
public
health
meeting
on
the
subject
of
drugs
;
but
he
became
entangled
with
a
girl
who
worked
in
a
grocery
store
,
and
he
was
also
involved
in
a
lawsuit
about
some
medical
question
;
so
he
left
Lockport
.
After
that
he
did
n't
ask
for
the
children
to
be
sent
to
America
and
did
n't
answer
when
Nicole
wrote
asking
him
if
he
needed
money
.
In
the
last
letter
she
had
from
him
he
told
her
that
he
was
practising
in
Geneva
,
New
York
,
and
she
got
the
impression
that
he
had
settled
down
with
some
one
to
keep
house
for
him
.
She
looked
up
Geneva
in
an
atlas
and
found
it
was
in
the
heart
of
the
Finger
Lakes
Section
and
considered
a
pleasant
place
.
Perhaps
,
so
she
liked
to
think
,
his
career
was
biding
its
time
,
again
like
Grant
's
in
Galena
;
his
latest
note
was
post-marked
from
Hornell
,
New
York
,
which
is
some
distance
from
Geneva
and
a
very
small
town
;
in
any
case
he
is
almost
certainly
in
that
section
of
the
country
,
in
one
town
or
another
.
